I see the boys of summer
I
I see the boys of summer in their ruin
Lay the gold tithings barren,
Setting no store by harvest, freeze the soils;
There in their heat the winter floods
Of frozen loves they fetch their girls,
And drown the cargoed apples in their tides.
These boys of light are curdlers in their folly,
Sour the boiling honey;
The jacks of frost they finger in the hives;
There in the sun the frigid threads
Of doubt and dark they feed their nerves;
The signal moon is zero in their voids.
I see the summer children in their mothers
Split up the brawned womb's weathers,
Divide the night and day with fairy thumbs;
There in the deep with quartered shades
Of sun and moon they paint their dams
As sunlight paints the shelling of their heads.
I see that from these boys shall men of nothing
Stature by seedy shifting,
Or lame the air with leaping from its heats;
There from their hearts the dogdayed pulse
Of love and light bursts in their throats.
O see the pulse of summer in the ice.
II
But seasons must be challenged or they totter
Into a chiming quarter
Where, punctual as death, we ring the stars;
There, in his night, the black-tongued bells
The sleepy man of winter pulls,
Nor blows back moon-and-midnight as she blows.
We are the dark deniers, let us summon
Death from a summer woman,
A muscling life from lovers in their cramp,
From the fair dead who flush the sea
The bright-eyed worm on Davy's lamp,
And from the planted womb the man of straw.
We summer boys in this four-winded spinning,
Green of the seaweeds' iron,
Hold up the noisy sea and drop her birds,
Pick the world's ball of wave and froth
To choke the deserts with her tides,
And comb the county gardens for a wreath.
In spring we cross our foreheads with the holly,
Heigh ho the blood and berry,
And nail the merry squires to the trees;
Here love's damp muscle dries and dies,
Here break a kiss in no love's quarry.
O see the poles of promise in the boys.
III
I see you boys of summer in your ruin.
Man in his maggot's barren.
And boys are full and foreign in the pouch.
I am the man your father was.
We are the sons of flint and pitch.
O see the poles are kissing as they cross.
When once the twilight locks no longer
Locked in the long worm of my finger
Nor damned the sea that sped about my fist,
The mouth of time sucked, like a sponge,
The milky acid on each hinge,
And swallowed dry the waters of the breast.
When the galactic sea was sucked
And all the dry seabed unlocked,
I sent my creature scouting on the globe,
That globe itself of hair and bone
That, sewn to me by nerve and brain,
Had stringed my flask of matter to his rib.
My fuses timed to charge his heart,
He blew like powder to the light
And held a little sabbath with the sun,
But when the stars, assuming shape,
Drew in his eyes the straws of sleep,
He drowned his father's magics in a dream.
All issue armoured, of the grave,
The redhaired cancer still alive,
The cataracted eyes that filmed their cloth;
Some dead undid their bushy jaws,
And bags of blood let out their flies;
He had by heart the Christ-cross-row of death.
Sleep navigates the tides of time;
The dry Sargasso of the tomb
Gives up its dead to such a working sea;
And sleep rolls mute above the beds
Where fishes' food is fed the shades
Who periscope through flowers to the sky.
When once the twilight screws were turned,
And mother milk was stiff as sand,
I sent my own ambassador to light;
By trick or chance he fell asleep
And conjured up a carcass shape
To rob me of my fluids in his heart.
Awake, my sleeper, to the sun,
A worker in the morning town,
And leave the poppied pickthank where he lies;
The fences of the light are down,
All but the briskest riders thrown
And worlds hang on the trees.
A process in the weather of the heart
Turns damp to dry; the golden shot
Storms in the freezing tomb.
A weather in the quarter of the veins
Turns night to day; blood in their suns
Lights up the living worm.
A process in the eye forwarns
The bones of blindness; and the womb
Drives in a death as life leaks out.
A darkness in the weather of the eye
Is half its light; the fathomed sea
Breaks on unangled land.
The seed that makes a forest of the loin
Forks half its fruit; and half drops down,
Slow in a sleeping wind.
A weather in the flesh and bone
Is damp and dry; the quick and dead
Move like two ghosts before the eye.
A process in the weather of the world
Turns ghost to ghost; each mothered child
Sits in their double shade.
A process blows the moon into the sun,
Pulls down the shabby curtains of the skin;
And the heart gives up its dead.
Before I knocked
Before I knocked and flesh let enter,
With liquid hands tapped on the womb,
I who was shapeless as the water
That shaped the Jordan near my home
Was brother to Mnetha's daughter
And sister to the fathering worm.
I who was deaf to spring and summer,
Who knew not sun nor moon by name,
Felt thud beneath my flesh's armour,
As yet was in a molten form
The leaden stars, the rainy hammer
Swung by my father from his dome.
I knew the message of the winter,
The darted hail, the childish snow,
And the wind was my sister suitor;
Wind in me leaped, the hellborn dew;
My veins flowed with the Eastern weather;
Ungotten I knew night and day.
As yet ungotten, I did suffer;
The rack of dreams my lily bones
Did twist into a living cipher,
And flesh was snipped to cross the lines
Of gallow crosses on the liver
And brambles in the wringing brains.
My throat knew thirst before the structure
Of skin and vein around the well
Where words and water make a mixture
Unfailing till the blood runs foul;
My heart knew love, my belly hunger;
I smelt the maggot in my stool.
And time cast forth my mortal creature
To drift or drown upon the seas
Acquainted with the salt adventure
Of tides that never touch the shores.
I who was rich was made the richer
By sipping at the vine of days.
I, born of flesh and ghost, was neither
A ghost nor man, but mortal ghost.
And I was struck down by death's feather.
I was a mortal to the last
Long breath that carried to my father
The message of his dying christ.
You who bow down at cross and altar,
Remember me and pity Him
Who took my flesh and bone for armour
And doublecrossed my mother's womb.
The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
Is my destroyer.
And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose
My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.
The force that drives the water through the rocks
Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
Turns mine to wax.
And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins
How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.
The hand that whirls the water in the pool
Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
Hauls my shroud sail.
And I am dumb to tell the hanging man
How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.
The lips of time leech to the fountain head;
Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
Shall calm her sores.
And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind
How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.
And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.
My hero bares his nerves along my wrist
That rules from wrist to shoulder,
Unpacks the head that, like a sleepy ghost,
Leans on my mortal ruler,
The proud spine spurning turn and twist.
And these poor nerves so wired to the skull
Ache on the lovelorn paper
I hug to love with my unruly scrawl
That utters all love hunger
And tells the page the empty ill.
My hero bares my side and sees his heart
Tread, like a naked Venus,
The beach of flesh, and wind her bloodred plait;
Stripping my loin of promise,
He promises a secret heat.
He holds the wire from this box of nerves
Praising the mortal error
Of birth and death, the two sad knaves of thieves,
And the hunger's emperor;
He pulls that chain, the cistern moves.
Where once the waters of your face
Spun to my screws, your dry ghost blows,
The dead turns up its eye;
Where once the mermen through your ice
Pushed up their hair, the dry wind steers
Through salt and root and roe.
Where once your green knots sank their splice
Into the tided cord, there goes
The green unraveller,
His scissors oiled, his knife hung loose
To cut the channels at their source
And lay the wet fruits low.
Invisible, your clocking tides
Break on the lovebeds of the weeds;
The weed of love's left dry;
There round about your stones the shades
Of children go who, from their voids,
Cry to the dolphined sea.
Dry as a tomb, your coloured lids
Shall not be latched while magic glides
Sage on the earth and sky;
There shall be corals in your beds,
There shall be serpents in your tides,
Till all our sea-faiths die.
If I were tickled by the rub of love
If I were tickled by the rub of love,
A rooking girl who stole me for her side,
Broke through her straws, breaking my bandaged string,
If the red tickle as the cattle calve
Still set to scratch a laughter from my lung,
I would not fear the apple nor the flood
Nor the bad blood of spring.
Shall it be male or female? say the cells,
And drop the plum like fire from the flesh.
If I were tickled by the hatching hair,
The winging bone that sprouted in the heels,
The itch of man upon the baby's thigh,
I would not fear the gallows nor the axe
Nor the crossed sticks of war.
Shall it be male or female? say the fingers
That chalk the walls with green girls and their men.
I would not fear the muscling-in of love
If I were tickled by the urchin hungers
Rehearsing heat upon a raw-edged nerve.
I would not fear the devil in the loin
Nor the outspoken grave.
If I were tickled by the lovers' rub
That wipes away not crow's-foot nor the lock
Of sick old manhood on the fallen jaws,
Time and the crabs and the sweethearting crib
Would leave me cold as butter for the flies,
The sea of scums could drown me as it broke
Dead on the sweethearts' toes.
This world is half the devil's and my own,
Daft with the drug that's smoking in a girl
And curling round the bud that forks her eye.
An old man's shank one-marrowed with my bone,
And all the herrings smelling in the sea,
I sit and watch the worm beneath my nail
Wearing the quick away.
And that's the rub, the only rub that tickles.
The knobbly ape that swings along his sex
From damp love-darkness and the nurse's twist
Can never raise the midnight of a chuckle,
Nor when he finds a beauty in the breast
Of lover, mother, lovers, or his six
Feet in the rubbing dust.
And what's the rub? Death's feather on the nerve?
Your mouth, my love, the thistle in the kiss?
My Jack of Christ born thorny on the tree?
The words of death are dryer than his stiff,
My wordy wounds are printed with your hair.
I would be tickled by the rub that is:
Man be my metaphor.
I
Our eunuch dreams, all seedless in the light,
Of light and love, the tempers of the heart,
Whack their boys' limbs,
And, winding-footed in their shawl and sheet,
Groom the dark brides, the widows of the night
Fold in their arms.
The shades of girls, all flavoured from their shrouds,
When sunlight goes are sundered from the worm,
The bones of men, the broken in their beds,
By midnight pulleys that unhouse the tomb.
II
In this our age the gunman and his moll,
Two one-dimensional ghosts, love on a reel,
Strange to our solid eye,
And speak their midnight nothings as they swell;
When cameras shut they hurry to their hole
down in the yard of day.
They dance between their arclamps and our skull,
Impose their shots, showing the nights away;
We watch the show of shadows kiss or kill
Flavoured of celluloid give love the lie.
III
Which is the world? Of our two sleepings, which
Shall fall awake when cures and their itch
Raise up this red-eyed earth?
Pack off the shapes of daylight and their starch,
The sunny gentlemen, the Welshing rich,
Or drive the night-geared forth.
The photograph is married to the eye,
Grafts on its bride one-sided skins of truth;
The dream has sucked the sleeper of his faith
That shrouded men might marrow as they fly.
IV
This is the world: the lying likeness of
Our strips of stuff that tatter as we move
Loving and being loth;
The dream that kicks the buried from their sack
And lets their trash be honoured as the quick.
This is the world. Have faith.
For we shall be a shouter like the cock,
Blowing the old dead back; our shots shall smack
The image from the plates;
And we shall be fit fellows for a life,
And who remains shall flower as they love,
Praise to our faring hearts.
Especially when the October wind
With frosty fingers punishes my hair,
Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fire
And cast a shadow crab upon the land,
By the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,
Hearing the raven cough in winter sticks,
My busy heart who shudders as she talks
Sheds the syllabic blood and drains her words.
Shut, too, in a tower of words, I mark
On the horizon walking like the trees
The wordy shapes of women, and the rows
Of the star-gestured children in the park.
Some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,
Some of the oaken voices, from the roots
Of many a thorny shire tell you notes,
Some let me make you of the water's speeches.
Behind a pot of ferns the wagging clock
Tells me the hour's word, the neural meaning
Flies on the shafted disk, declaims the morning
And tells the windy weather in the cock.
Some let me make you of the meadow's signs;
The signal grass that tells me all I know
Breaks with the wormy winter through the eye.
Some let me tell you of the raven's sins.
Especially when the October wind
(Some let me make you of autumnal spells,
The spider-tongued, and the loud hill of Wales)
With fists of turnips punishes the land,
Some let me make of you the heartless words.
The heart is drained that, spelling in the scurry
Of chemic blood, warned of the coming fury.
By the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds.
When, like a running grave, time tracks you down,
Your calm and cuddled is a scythe of hairs,
Love in her gear is slowly through the house,
Up naked stairs, a turtle in a hearse,
Hauled to the dome,
Comes, like a scissors stalking, tailor age,
Deliver me who timid in my tribe,
Of love am barer than Cadaver's trap
Robbed of the foxy tongue, his footed tape
Of the bone inch
Deliver me, my masters, head and heart,
Heart of Cadaver's candle waxes thin,
When blood, spade-handed, and the logic time
Drive children up like bruises to the thumb,
From maid and head,
For, sunday faced, with dusters in my glove,
Chaste and the chaser, man with the cockshut eye,
I, that time's jacket or the coat of ice
May fail to fasten with a virgin o
In the straight grave,
Stride through Cadaver's country in my force,
My pickbrain masters morsing on the stone
Despair of blood, faith in the maiden's slime,
Halt among eunuchs, and the nitric stain
On fork and face.
Time is a foolish fancy, time and fool.
No, no, you lover skull, descending hammer
Descends, my masters, on the entered honour.
You hero skull, Cadaver in the hangar
Tells the stick, 'fail.'
Joy is no knocking nation, sir and madam,
The cancer's fashion, or the summer feather
Lit on the cuddled tree, the cross of fever,
Not city tar and subway bored to foster
Man through macadam.
I dump the waxlights in your tower dome.
Joy is the knock of dust, Cadaver's shoot
Of bud of Adam through his boxy shift,
Love's twilit nation and the skull of state,
Sir, is your doom.
Everything ends, the tower ending and,
(Have with the house of wind), the leaning scene,
Ball of the foot depending from the sun,
(Give, summer, over), the cemented skin,
The actions' end.
All, men my madmen, the unwholesome wind
With whistler's cough contages, time on track
Shapes in a cinder death; love for his trick,
Happy Cadaver's hunger as you take
The kissproof world.
From love's first fever to her plague, from the soft second
And to the hollow minute of the womb,
From the unfolding to the scissored caul,
The time for breast and the green apron age
When no mouth stirred about the hanging famine,
All world was one, one windy nothing,
My world was christened in a stream of milk.
And earth and sky were as one airy hill.
The sun and mood shed one white light.
From the first print of the unshodden foot, the lifting
Hand, the breaking of the hair,
From the first secret of the heart, the warning ghost,
And to the first dumb wonder at the flesh,
The sun was red, the moon was grey,
The earth and sky were as two mountains meeting.
The body prospered, teeth in the marrowed gums,
The growing bones, the rumour of the manseed
Within the hallowed gland, blood blessed the heart,
And the four winds, that had long blown as one,
Shone in my ears the light of sound,
Called in my eyes the sound of light.
And yellow was the multiplying sand,
Each golden grain spat life into its fellow,
Green was the singing house.
The plum my mother picked matured slowly,
The boy she dropped from darkness at her side
Into the sided lap of light grew strong,
Was muscled, matted, wise to the crying thigh,
And to the voice that, like a voice of hunger,
Itched in the noise of wind and sun.
And from the first declension of the flesh
I learnt man's tongue, to twist the shapes of thoughts
Into the stony idiom of the brain,
To shade and knit anew the patch of words
Left by the dead who, in their moonless acre,
Need no word's warmth.
The root of tongues ends in a spentout cancer,
That but a name, where maggots have their X.
I learnt the verbs of will, and had my secret;
The code of night tapped on my tongue;
What had been one was many sounding minded.
One wound, one mind, spewed out the matter,
One breast gave suck the fever's issue;
From the divorcing sky I learnt the double,
The two-framed globe that spun into a score;
A million minds gave suck to such a bud
As forks my eye;
Youth did condense; the tears of spring
Dissolved in summer and the hundred seasons;
One sun, one manna, warmed and fed.
In the beginning was the three-pointed star,
One smile of light across the empty face;
One bough of bone across the rooting air,
The substance forked that marrowed the first sun;
And, burning ciphers on the round of space,
Heaven and hell mixed as they spun.
In the beginning was the pale signature,
Three-syllabled and starry as the smile,
And after came the imprints on the water,
Stamp of the minted face upon the moon;
The blood that touched the crosstree and the grail
Touched the first cloud and left a sign.
In the beginning was the mounting fire
That set alight the weathers from a spark,
A three-eyed, red-eyed spark, blunt as a flower;
Life rose and spouted from the rolling seas,
Burst in the roots, pumped from the earth and rock
The secret oils that drive the grass.
In the beginning was the word, the word
That from the solid bases of the light
Abstracted all the letters of the void;
And from the cloudy bases of the breath
The word flowed up, translating to the heart
First characters of birth and death.
In the beginning was the secret brain.
The brain was celled and soldered in the thought
Before the pitch was forking to a sun;
Before the veins were shaking in their sieve,
Blood shot and scattered to the winds of light
The ribbed original of love.
Light breaks where no sun shines;
Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart
Push in their tides;
And, broken ghosts with glow-worms in their heads,
The things of light
File through the flesh where no flesh decks the bones.
A candle in the thighs
Warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age;
Where no seed stirs,
The fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars,
Bright as a fig;
Where no wax is, the candle shows its hairs.
Dawn breaks behind the eyes;
From poles of skull and toe the windy blood
Slides like a sea;
Nor fenced, nor staked, the gushers of the sky
Spout to the rod
Divining in a smile the oil of tears.
Night in the sockets rounds,
Like some pitch moon, the limit of the globes;
Day lights the bone;
Where no cold is, the skinning gales unpin
The winter's robes;
The film of spring is hanging from the lids.
Light breaks on secret lots,
On tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain;
When logics die,
The secret of the soil grows through the eye,
And blood jumps in the sun;
Above the waste allotments the dawn halts.
I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain,
Let fall the tear of time; the sleeper's eye,
Shifting to light, turned on me like a moon.
So, planning-heeled, I flew along my man
And dropped on dreaming and the upward sky.
I fled the earth and, naked, climbed the weather,
Reaching a second ground far from the stars;
And there we wept, I and a ghostly other,
My mothers-eyed, upon the tops of trees;
I fled that ground as lightly as a feather.
'My fathers' globe knocks on its nave and sings.'
'This that we tread was, too, your father's land.'
'But this we tread bears the angelic gangs,
Sweet are their fathered faces in their wings.'
'These are but dreaming men. Breathe, and they fade.'
Faded my elbow ghost, the mothers-eyed,
As, blowing on the angels, I was lost
On that cloud coast to each grave-grabbing shade;
I blew the dreaming fellows to their bed
Where still they sleep unknowing of their ghost.
Then all the matter of the living air
Raised up a voice, and, climbing on the words,
I spelt my vision with a hand and hair,
How light the sleeping on this soily star,
How deep the waking in the worlded clouds.
There grows the hours' ladder to the sun,
Each rung a love or losing to the last,
The inches monkeyed by the blood of man.
An old, mad man still climbing in his ghost,
My fathers' ghost is climbing in the rain.
I dreamed my genesis in sweat of sleep, breaking
Through the rotating shell, strong
As motor muscle on the drill, driving
Through vision and the girdered nerve.
From limbs that had the measure of the worm, shuffled
Off from the creasing flesh, filed
Through all the irons in the grass, metal
Of suns in the man-melting night.
Heir to the scalding veins that hold love's drop, costly
A creature in my bones I
Rounded my globe of heritage, journey
In bottom gear through night-geared man.
I dreamed my genesis and died again, shrapnel
Rammed in the marching heart, hole
In the stitched wound and clotted wind, muzzled
Death on the mouth that ate the gas.
Sharp in my second death I marked the hills, harvest
Of hemlock and the blades, rust
My blood upon the tempered dead, forcing
My second struggling from the grass.
And power was contagious in my birth, second
Rise of the skeleton and
Rerobing of the naked ghost. Manhood
Spat up from the resuffered pain.
I dreamed my genesis in sweat of death, fallen
Twice in the feeding sea, grown
Stale of Adam's brine until, vision
Of new man strength, I seek the sun.
I
Half of the fellow father as he doubles
His sea-sucked Adam in the hollow hulk,
Half of the fellow mother as she dabbles
To-morrow's diver in her horny milk,
Bisected shadows on the thunder's bone
Bolt for the salt unborn.
The fellow half was frozen as it bubbled
Corrosive spring out of the iceberg's crop,
The fellow seed and shadow as it babbled
The swing of milk was tufted in the pap,
For half of love was planted in the lost,
And the unplanted ghost.
The broken halves are fellowed in a cripple,
The crutch that marrow taps upon their sleep,
Limp in the street of sea, among the rabble
Of tide-tongued heads and bladders in the deep,
And stake the sleepers in the savage grave
That the vampire laugh.
The patchwork halves were cloven as they scudded
The wild pigs' wood, and slime upon the trees,
Sucking the dark, kissed on the cyanide,
And loosed the braiding adders from their hairs,
Rotating halves are horning as they drill
The arterial angel.
What colour is glory? death's feather? tremble
The halves that pierce the pin's point in the air,
And prick the thumb-stained heaven through the thimble.
The ghost is dumb that stammered in the straw,
The ghost that hatched his havoc as he flew
Blinds their cloud-tracking eye.
II
My world is pyramid. The padded mummer
Weeps on the desert ochre and the salt
Incising summer.
My Egypt's armour buckling in its sheet,
I scrape through resin to a starry bone
And a blood parhelion.
My world is cypress, and an English valley.
I piece my flesh that rattled on the yards
Red in an Austrian volley.
I hear, through dead men's drums, the riddled lads,
Screwing their bowels from a hill of bones,
Cry Eloi to the guns.
My grave is watered by the crossing Jordan.
The Arctic scut, and basin of the South,
Drip on my dead house garden.
Who seek me landward, marking in my mouth
The straws of Asia, lose me as I turn
Through the Atlantic corn.
The fellow halves that, cloven as they swivel
On casting tides, are tangled in the shells,
Bearding the unborn devil,
Bleed from my burning fork and smell my heels.
The tongue's of heaven gossip as I glide
Binding my angel's hood.
Who blows death's feather? What glory is colour?
I blow the stammel feather in the vein.
The loin is glory in a working pallor.
My clay unsuckled and my salt unborn,
The secret child, I sift about the sea
Dry in the half-tracked thigh.
I
All all and all the dry worlds lever,
Stage of the ice, the solid ocean,
All from the oil, the pound of lava.
City of spring, the governed flower,
Turns in the earth that turns the ashen
Towns around on a wheel of fire.
How now my flesh, my naked fellow,
Dug of the sea, the glanded morrow,
Worm in the scalp, the staked and fallow.
All all and all, the corpse's lover,
Skinny as sin, the foaming marrow,
All of the flesh, the dry worlds lever.
II
Fear not the waking world, my mortal,
Fear not the flat, synthetic blood,
Nor the heart in the ribbing metal.
Fear not the tread, the seeded milling,
The trigger and scythe, the bridal blade,
Nor the flint in the lover's mauling.
Man of my flesh, the jawbone riven,
Know now the flesh's lock and vice,
And the cage for the scythe-eyed raven.
Know, O my bone, the jointed lever,
Fear not the screws that turn the voice,
And the face to the driven lover.
III
All all and all the dry worlds couple,
Ghost with her ghost, contagious man
With the womb of his shapeless people.
All that shapes from the caul and suckle,
Stroke of mechanical flesh on mine,
Square in these worlds the mortal circle.
Flower, flower the people's fusion,
O light in zenith, the coupled bud,
And the flame in the flesh's vision.
Out of the sea, the drive of oil,
Socket and grave, the brassy blood,
Flower, flower, all all and all.
I
I, in my intricate image, stride on two levels,
Forged in man's minerals, the brassy orator
Laying my ghost in metal,
The scales of this twin world tread on the double,
My half ghost in armour hold hard in death's corridor,
To my man-iron sidle.
Beginning with doom in the bulb, the spring unravels,
Bright as her spinning-wheels, the colic season
Worked on a world of petals;
She threads off the sap and needles, blood and bubble
Casts to the pine roots, raising man like a mountain
Out of the naked entrail.
Beginning with doom in the ghost, and the springing marvels,
Image of images, my metal phantom
Forcing forth through the harebell,
My man of leaves and the bronze root, mortal, unmortal,
I, in my fusion of rose and male motion,
Create this twin miracle.
This is the fortune of manhood: the natural peril,
A steeplejack tower, bonerailed and masterless,
No death more natural;
Thus the shadowless man or ox, and the pictured devil,
In seizure of silence commit the dead nuisance:
The natural parallel.
My images stalk the trees and the slant sap's tunnel,
No tread more perilous, the green steps and spire
Mount on man's footfall,
I with the wooden insect in the tree of nettles,
In the glass bed of grapes with snail and flower,
Hearing the weather fall.
Intricate manhood of ending, the invalid rivals,
Voyaging clockwise off the symboled harbour,
Finding the water final,
On the consumptives' terrace taking their two farewells,
Sail on the level, the departing adventure,
To the sea-blown arrival.
II
They climb the country pinnacle,
Twelve winds encounter by the white host at pasture,
Corner the mounted meadows in the hill corral;
They see the squirrel stumble,
The haring snail go giddily round the flower,
A quarrel of weathers and trees in the windy spiral.
As they dive, the dust settles,
The cadaverous gravels, falls thick and steadily,
The highroad of water where the seabear and mackerel
Turn the long sea arterial
Turning a petrol face blind to the enemy
Turning the riderless dead by the channel wall.
(Death instrumental,
Splitting the long eye open, and the spiral turnkey,
Your corkscrew grave centred in navel and nipple,
The neck of the nostril,
Under the mask and the ether, they making bloody
The tray of knives, the antiseptic funeral;
Bring out the black patrol,
Your monstrous officers and the decaying army,
The sexton sentinel, garrisoned under thistles,
A cock-on-a-dunghill
Crowing to Lazarus the morning is vanity,
Dust be your saviour under the conjured soil.)
As they drown, the chime travels,
Sweetly the diver's bell in the steeple of spindrift
Rings out the Dead Sea scale;
And, clapped in water till the triton dangles,
Strung by the flaxen whale-weed, from the hangman's raft,
Hear they the salt glass breakers and the tongues of burial.
(Turn the sea-spindle lateral,
The grooved land rotating, that the stylus of lightning
Dazzle this face of voices on the moon-turned table,
Let the wax disk babble
Shames and the damp dishonours, the relic scraping.
These are your years' recorders. The circular world stands still.)
III
They suffer the undead water where the turtle nibbles,
Come unto sea-stuck towers, at the fibre scaling,
The flight of the carnal skull
And the cell-stepped thimble;
Suffer, my topsy-turvies, that a double angel
Sprout from the stony lockers like a tree on Aran.
Be by your one ghost pierced, his pointed ferrule,
Brass and the bodiless image, on a stick of folly
Star-set at Jacob's angle,
Smoke hill and hophead's valley,
And the five-fathomed Hamlet on his father's coral,
Thrusting the tom-thumb vision up the iron mile.
Suffer the slash of vision by the fin-green stubble,
Be by the ships' sea broken at the manstring anchored
The stoved bones' voyage downward
In the shipwreck of muscle;
Give over, lovers, locking, and the seawax struggle,
Love like a mist or fire through the bed of eels.
And in the pincers of the boiling circle,
The sea and instrument, nicked in the locks of time,
My great blood's iron single
In the pouring town,
I, in a wind on fire, from green Adam's cradle,
No man more magical, clawed out the crocodile.
Man was the scales, the death birds on enamel,
Tail, Nile, and snout, a saddler of the rushes,
Time in the hourless houses
Shaking the sea-hatched skull,
And, as for oils and ointments on the flying grail,
All-hollowed man wept for his white apparel.
Man was Cadaver's masker, the harnessing mantle,
Windily master of man was the rotten fathom,
My ghost in his metal neptune
Forged in man's mineral.
This was the god of beginning in the intricate seawhirl,
And my images roared and rose on heaven's hill.
This bread I break was once the oat,
This wine upon a foreign tree
Plunged in its fruit;
Man in the day or wine at night
Laid the crops low, broke the grape's joy.
Once in this time wine the summer blood
Knocked in the flesh that decked the vine,
Once in this bread
The oat was merry in the wind;
Man broke the sun, pulled the wind down.
This flesh you break, this blood you let
Make desolation in the vein,
Were oat and grape
Born of the sensual root and sap;
My wine you drink, my bread you snap.
Incarnate devil in a talking snake,
The central plains of Asia in his garden,
In shaping-time the circle stung awake,
In shapes of sin forked out the bearded apple,
And God walked there who was a fiddling warden
And played down pardon from the heavens' hill.
When we were strangers to the guided seas,
A handmade moon half holy in a cloud,
The wisemen tell me that the garden gods
Twined good and evil on an eastern tree;
And when the moon rose windily it was
Black as the beast and paler than the cross.
We in our Eden knew the secret guardian
In sacred waters that no frost could harden,
And in the mighty mornings of the earth;
Hell in a horn of sulphur and the cloven myth,
All heaven in the midnight of the sun,
A serpent fiddled in the shaping-time.
To-day, this insect, and the world I breathe,
Now that my symbols have outelbowed space,
Time at the city spectacles, and half
The dear, daft time I take to nudge the sentence,
In trust and tale I have divided sense,
Slapped down the guillotine, the blood-red double
Of head and tail made witnesses to this
Murder of Eden and green genesis.
The insect certain is the plague of fables.
This story's monster has a serpent caul,
Blind in the coil scrams round the blazing outline,
Measures his own length on the garden wall
And breaks his shell in the last shocked beginning;
A crocodile before the chrysalis,
Before the fall from love the flying heartbone,
Winged like a sabbath ass this children's piece
Uncredited blows Jericho on Eden.
The insect fable is the certain promise.
Death: death of Hamlet and the nightmare madmen,
An air-drawn windmill on a wooden horse,
John's beast, Job's patience, and the fibs of vision,
Greek in the Irish sea the ageless voice:
'Adam I love, my madmen's love is endless,
No tell-tale lover has an end more certain,
All legends' sweethearts on a tree of stories,
My cross of tales behind the fabulous curtain.'
The seed-at-zero shall not storm
That town of ghosts, the trodden womb,
With her rampart to his tapping,
No god-in-hero tumble down
Like a tower on the town
Dumbly and divinely stumbling
Over the manwaging line.
The seed-at-zero shall not storm
That town of ghosts, the manwaged tomb
With her rampart to his tapping,
No god-in-hero tumble down
Like a tower on the town
Dumbly and divinely leaping
Over the warbearing line.
Through the rampart of the sky
Shall the star-flanked seed be riddled,
Manna for the rumbling ground,
Quickening for the riddled sea;
Settled on a virgin stronghold
He shall grapple with the guard
And the keeper of the key.
Through the rampart of the sky
Shall the star-flanked seed be riddled,
Manna for the guarded ground,
Quickening for the virgin sea;
Settling on a riddled stronghold
He shall grapple with the guard
And the loser of the key.
May a humble village labour
And a continent deny?
A hemisphere may scold him
And a green inch be his bearer;
Let the hero seed find harbour,
Seaports by a drunken shore
Have their thirsty sailors hide him.
May a humble planet labour
And a continent deny?
A village green may scold him
And a high sphere be his bearer;
Let the hero seed find harbour,
Seaports by a thirsty shore
Have their drunken sailors hide him.
Man-in-seed, in seed-at-zero,
From the foreign fields of space,
Shall not thunder on the town
With a star-flanked garrison,
Nor the cannons of his kingdom
Shall the hero-in-tomorrow
Range on the sky-scraping place.
Man-in-seed, in seed-at-zero,
From the star-flanked fields of space,
Thunders on the foreign town
With a sand-bagged garrison,
Nor the cannons of his kingdom
Shall the hero-in-to-morrow
Range from the grave-groping place.
Shall gods be said to thump the clouds
When clouds are cursed by thunder,
Be said to weep when weather howls?
Shall rainbows be their tunics' colour?
When it is rain where are the gods?
Shall it be said they sprinkle water
From garden cans, or free the floods?
Shall it be said that, venuswise,
An old god's dugs are pressed and pricked,
The wet night scolds me like a nurse?
It shall be said that gods are stone.
Shall a dropped stone drum on the ground,
Flung gravel chime? Let the stones speak
With tongues that talk all tongues.
Here in this spring, stars float along the void;
Here in this ornamental winter
Down pelts the naked weather;
This summer buries a spring bird.
Symbols are selected from the years'
Slow rounding of four seasons' coasts,
In autumn teach three seasons' fires
And four birds' notes.
I should tell summer from the trees, the worms
Tell, if at all, the winter's storms
Or the funeral of the sun;
I should learn spring by the cuckooing,
And the slug should teach me destruction.
A worm tells summer better than the clock,
The slug's a living calendar of days;
What shall it tell me if a timeless insect
Says the world wears away?
Do you not father me, nor the erected arm
For my tall tower's sake cast in her stone?
Do you not mother me, nor, as I am,
The lovers' house, lie suffering my stain?
Do you not sister me, nor the erected crime
For my tall turrets carry as your sin?
Do you not brother me, nor, as you climb,
Adore my windows for their summer scene?
Am I not father, too, and the ascending boy,
The boy of woman and the wanton starer
Marking the flesh and summer in the bay?
Am I not sister, too, who is my saviour?
Am I not all of you by the directed sea
Where bird and shell are babbling in my tower?
Am I not you who front the tidy shore,
Nor roof of sand, nor yet the towering tiler?
You are all these, said she who gave me the long suck,
All these, he said who sacked the children's town,
Up rose the Abraham-man, mad for my sake,
They said, who hacked and humoured, they were mine.
I am, the tower told, felled by a timeless stroke,
Who razed my wooden folly stands aghast,
For man-begetters in the dry-as-paste,
The ringed-sea ghost, rise grimly from the wrack.
Do you not father me on the destroying sand?
You are your sisters' sire, said seaweedy,
The salt sucked dam and darlings of the land
Who play the proper gentleman and lady.
Shall I still be love's house on the widdershin earth,
Woe to the windy masons at my shelter?
Love's house, they answer, and the tower death
Lie all unknowing of the grave sin-eater.
Out of the sighs a little comes,
But not of grief, for I have knocked down that
Before the agony; the spirit grows,
Forgets, and cries;
A little comes, is tasted and found good;
All could not disappoint;
There must, be praised, some certainty,
If not of loving well, then not,
And that is true after perpetual defeat.
After such fighting as the weakest know,
There's more than dying;
Lose the great pains or stuff the wound,
He'll ache too long
Through no regret of leaving woman waiting
For her soldier stained with spilt words
That spill such acrid blood.
Were that enough, enough to ease the pain,
Feeling regret when this is wasted
That made me happy in the sun,
How much was happy while it lasted,
Were vagueness enough and the sweet lies plenty,
The hollow words could bear all suffering
And cure me of ills.
Were that enough, bone, blood, and sinew,
The twisted brain, the fair-formed loin,
Groping for matter under the dog's plate,
Man should be cured of distemper.
For all there is to give I offer:
Crumbs, barn, and halter.
Hold hard, these ancient minutes in the cuckoo's month,
Under the lank, fourth folly on Glamorgan's hill,
As the green blooms ride upward, to the drive of time;
Time, in a folly's rider, like a county man
Over the vault of ridings with his hound at heel,
Drives forth my men, my children, from the hanging south.
Country, your sport is summer, and December's pools
By crane and water-tower by the seedy trees
Lie this fifth month unskated, and the birds have flown;
Holy hard, my country children in the world of tales,
The greenwood dying as the deer fall in their tracks,
The first and steepled season, to the summer's game.
And now the horns of England, in the sound of shape,
Summon your snowy horsemen, and the four-stringed hill,
Over the sea-gut loudening, sets a rock alive;
Hurdles and guns and railings, as the boulders heave,
Crack like a spring in vice, bone breaking April,
Spill the lank folly's hunter and the hard-held hope.
Down fall four padding weathers on the scarlet lands,
Stalking my children's faces with a tail of blood,
Time, in a rider rising, from the harnessed valley;
Hold hard, my country darlings, for a hawk descends,
Golden Glamorgan straightens, to the falling birds.
Your sport is summer as the spring runs angrily.
Was there a time when dancers with their fiddles
In children's circuses could stay their troubles?
There was a time they could cry over books,
But time has set its maggot on their track.
Under the arc of the sky they are unsafe.
What's never known is safest in this life.
Under the skysigns they who have no arms
Have cleanest hands, and, as the heartless ghost
Alone's unhurt, so the blind man sees best.
Now
Say nay,
Man dry man,
Dry lover mine
The deadrock base and blow the flowered anchor,
Should he, for centre sake, hop in the dust,
Forsake, the fool, the hardiness of anger.
Now
Say nay,
Sir no say,
Death to the yes,
the yes to death, the yesman and the answer,
Should he who split his children with a cure
Have brotherless his sister on the handsaw.
Now
Say nay,
No say sir
Yea the dead stir,
And this, nor this, is shade, the landed crow,
He lying low with ruin in his ear,
The cockrel's tide upcasting from the fire.
Now
Say nay,
So star fall,
So the ball fail,
So solve the mystic sun, the wife of light,
The sun that leaps on petals through a nought,
The come-a-cropper rider of the flower.
Now
Say nay
A fig for
The seal of fire,
Death hairy-heeled and the tapped ghost in wood,
We make me mystic as the arm of air,
The two-a-vein, the foreskin, and the cloud.
Why east wind chills and south wind cools
Shall not be known till windwell dries
And west's no longer drowned
In winds that bring the fruit and rind
Of many a hundred falls;
Why silk is soft and the stone wounds
The child shall question all his days,
Why night-time rain and the breast's blood
Both quench his thirst he'll have a black reply.
When cometh Jack Frost? the children ask.
Shall they clasp a comet in their fists?
Not till, from high and low, their dust
Sprinkles in children's eyes a long-last sleep
And dusk is crowded with the children's ghosts,
Shall a white answer echo from the rooftops.
All things are known: the stars' advice
Calls some content to travel with the winds,
Though what the stars ask as they round
Time upon time the towers of the skies
Is heard but little till the stars go out.
I hear content, and 'Be Content'
Ring like a handbell through the corridors,
And 'Know no answer,' and I know
No answer to the children's cry
Of echo's answer and the man of frost
And ghostly comets over the raised fists.
A grief ago,
She who was who I hold, the fats and the flower,
Or, water-lammed, from the scythe-sided thorn,
Hell wind and sea,
A stem cementing, wrestled up the tower,
Rose maid and male,
Or, master venus, through the paddler's bowl
Sailed up the sun;
Who is my grief,
A chrysalis unwrinkling on the iron,
Wrenched by my fingerman, the leaden bud
Shot through the leaf,
Was who was folded on the rod the aaron
Road east to plague,
The horn and ball of water on the frog
Housed in the side.
And she who lies,
Like exodus a chapter from the garden,
Brand of the lily's anger on her ring,
Tugged through the days
Her ropes of heritage, the wars of pardon,
On field and sand
The twelve triangles of the cherub wind
Engraving going.
Who then is she,
She holding me? The people's sea drives on her,
Drives out the father from the caesared camp;
The dens of shape
Shape all her whelps with the long voice of water,
That she I have,
The country-handed grave boxed into love,
Rise before dark.
The night is near,
A nitric shape that leaps her, time and acid;
I tell her this: before the suncock cast
Her bone to fire,
Let her inhale her dead, through seed and solid
Draw in their seas,
So cross her hand with their grave gipsy eyes,
And close her fist.
How soon the servant sun,
(Sir morrow mark),
Can time unriddle, and the cupboard stone,
(Fog has a bone
He'll trumpet into meat),
Unshelve that all my gristles have a gown
And the naked egg stand straight,
Sir morrow at his sponge,
(The wound records),
The nurse of giants by the cut sea basin,
(Fog by his spring
Soaks up the sewing tides),
Tells you and you, my masters, as his strange
Man morrow blows through food.
All nerves to serve the sun,
The rite of light,
A claw I question from the mouse's bone,
The long-tailed stone
Trap I with coil and sheet,
Let the soil squeal I am the biting man
And the velvet dead inch out.
How soon my level, lord,
(Sir morrow stamps
Two heels of water on the floor of seed),
Shall raise a lamp
Or spirit up a cloud,
Erect a walking centre in the shroud,
Invisible on the stump
A leg as long as trees,
This inward sir,
Mister and master, darkness for his eyes,
The womb-eyed, cries,
And all sweet hell, deaf as an hour's ear,
Blasts back the trumpet voice.
Ears in the turrets hear
Hands grumble on the door,
Eyes in the gables see
The fingers at the locks.
Shall I unbolt or stay
Alone till the day I die
Unseen by stranger-eyes
In this white house?
Hands, hold you poison or grapes?
Beyond this island bound
By a thin sea of flesh
And a bone coast,
The land lies out of sound
And the hills out of mind.
No birds or flying fish
Disturbs this island's rest.
Ears in this island hear
The wind pass like a fire,
Eyes in this island see
Ships anchor off the bay.
Shall I run to the ships
With the wind in my hair,
Or stay till the day I die
And welcome no sailor?
Ships, hold you poison or grapes?
Hands grumble on the door,
Ships anchor off the bay,
Rain beats the sand and slates.
Shall I let in the stranger,
Shall I welcome the sailor,
Or stay till the day I die?
Hands of the stranger and holds of the ships,
Hold you poison or grapes?
Foster the light nor veil the manshaped moon,
Nor weather winds that blow not down the bone,
But strip the twelve-winded marrow from his circle;
Master the night nor serve the snowman's brain
That shapes each bushy item of the air
Into a polestar pointed on an icicle.
Murmur of spring nor crush the cockerel's eggs,
Nor hammer back a season in the figs,
But graft these four-fruited ridings on your country;
Farmer in time of frost the burning leagues,
By red-eyed orchards sow the seeds of snow,
In your young years the vegetable century.
And father all nor fail the fly-lord's acre,
Nor sprout on owl-seed like a goblin-sucker,
But rail with your wizard's ribs the heart-shaped planet;
Of mortal voices to the ninnies' choir,
High lord esquire, speak up the singing cloud,
And pluck a mandrake music from the marrowroot.
Roll unmanly over this turning tuft,
O ring of seas, nor sorrow as I shift
From all my mortal lovers with a starboard smile;
Nor when my love lies in the cross-boned drift
Naked among the bow-and-arrow birds
Shall you turn cockwise on a tufted axle.
Who gave these seas their colour in a shape,
Shaped my clayfellow, and the heaven's ark
In time at flood filled with his coloured doubles;
O who is glory in the shapeless maps,
Now make the world of me as I have made
A merry manshape of your walking circle.
The hand that signed the paper felled a city;
Five sovereign fingers taxed the breath,
Doubled the globe of dead and halved a country;
These five kings did a king to death.
The mighty hand leads to a sloping shoulder,
The finger joints are cramped with chalk;
A goose's quill has put an end to murder
That put an end to talk.
The hand that signed the treaty bred a fever,
And famine grew, and locusts came;
Great is the hand that holds dominion over
Man by a scribbled name.
The five kings count the dead but do not soften
The crusted wound nor pat the brow;
A hand rules pity as a hand rules heaven;
Hands have no tears to flow.
Should lanterns shine, the holy face,
Caught in an octagon of unaccustomed light,
Would wither up, and any boy of love
Look twice before he fell from grace.
The features in their private dark
Are formed of flesh, but let the false day come
And from her lips the faded pigments fall,
The mummy cloths expose an ancient breast.
I have been told to reason by the heart,
But heart, like head, leads helplessly;
I have been told to reason by the pulse,
And, when it quickens, alter the actions' pace
Till field and roof lie level and the same
So fast I move defying time, the quiet gentleman
Whose beard wags in Egyptian wind.
I have heard many years of telling,
And many years should see some change.
The ball I threw while playing in the park
Has not yet reached the ground.
I have longed to move away
From the hissing of the spent lie
And the old terrors' continual cry
Growing more terrible as the day
Goes over the hill into the deep sea;
I have longed to move away
From the repetition of salutes,
For there are ghosts in the air
And ghostly echoes on paper,
And the thunder of calls and notes.
I have longed to move away but am afraid;
Some life, yet unspent, might explode
Out of the old lie burning on the ground,
And, crackling into the air, leave me half-blind.
Neither by night's ancient fear,
The parting of hat from hair,
Pursed lips at the receiver,
Shall I fall to death's feather.
By these I would not care to die,
Half convention and half lie.
'Find meat on bones that soon have none,
And drink in the two milked crags,
The merriest marrow and the dregs
Before the ladies' breasts are hags
And the limbs are torn.
Disturb no winding-sheets, my son,
But when the ladies are cold as stone
Then hang a ram rose over the rags.
'Rebel against the binding moon
And the parliament of sky,
The kingcrafts of the wicked sea,
Autocracy of night and day,
Dictatorship of sun.
Rebel against the flesh and bone,
The word of the blood, the wily skin,
And the maggot no man can slay.'
'The thirst is quenched, the hunger gone,
And my heart is cracked across;
My face is haggard in the glass,
My lips are withered with a kiss,
My breasts are thin.
A merry girl took me for man,
I laid her down and told her sin,
And put beside her a ram rose.
'The maggot that no man can kill
And the man no rope can hang
Rebel against my father's dream
That out of a bower of red swine
Howls the foul fiend to heel.
I cannot murder, like a fool,
Season and sunshine, grace and girl,
Nor can I smother the sweet waking.'
Black night still ministers the moon,
And the sky lays down her laws,
The sea speaks in a kingly voice,
Light and dark are no enemies
But one companion.
'War on the spider and the wren!
War on the destiny of man!
Doom on the sun!'
Before death takes you, O take back this.
Grief thief of time crawls off,
The moon-drawn grave, with the seafaring years,
The knave of pain steals off
The sea-halved faith that blew time to his knees,
The old forget the cries,
Lean time on tide and times the wind stood rough,
Call back the castaways
Riding the sea light on a sunken path,
The old forget the grief,
Hack of the cough, the hanging albatross,
Cast back the bone of youth
And salt-eyed stumble bedward where she lies
Who tossed the high tide in a time of stories
And timelessly lies loving with the thief.
Now Jack my fathers let the time-faced crook,
Death flashing from his sleeve,
With swag of bubbles in a seedy sack
Sneak down the stallion grave,
Bull's-eye the outlaw through a eunuch crack
And free the twin-boxed grief,
No silver whistles chase him down the weeks'
Dayed peaks to day to death,
These stolen bubbles have the bites of snakes
And the undead eye-teeth,
No third eye probe into a rainbow's sex
That bridged the human halves,
All shall remain and on the graveward gulf
Shape with my fathers' thieves.
And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan't crack;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion.
Then was my neophyte,
Child in white blood bent on its knees
Under the bell of rocks,
Ducked in the twelve, disciple seas
The winder of the water-clocks
Calls a green day and night.
My sea hermaphrodite,
Snail of man in His ship of fires
That burn the bitten decks,
Knew all His horrible desires
The climber of the water sex
Calls the green rock of light.
Who in these labyrinths,
This tidethread and the lane of scales,
Twine in a moon-blown shell,
Escapes to the flat cities' sails
Furled on the fishes' house and hell,
Nor falls to His green myths?
Stretch the salt photographs,
The landscape grief, love in His oils
Mirror from man to whale
That the green child see like a grail
Through veil and fin and fire and coil
Time on the canvas paths.
He films my vanity.
Shot in the wind, by tilted arcs,
Over the water come
Children from homes and children's parks
Who speak on a finger and thumb,
And the masked, headless boy.
His reels and mystery
The winder of the clockwise scene
Wound like a ball of lakes
Then threw on that tide-hoisted screen
Love's image till my heartbone breaks
By a dramatic sea.
Who kills my history?
The year-hedged row is lame with flint,
Blunt scythe and water blade.
'Who could snap off the shapeless print
From your to-morrow-treading shade
With oracle for eye?'
Time kills me terribly.
'Time shall not murder you,' He said,
'Nor the green nought be hurt;
Who could hack out your unsucked heart,
O green and unborn and undead?'
I saw time murder me.
I
Altarwise by owl-light in the half-way house
The gentleman lay graveward with his furies;
Abaddon in the hangnail cracked from Adam,
And, from his fork, a dog among the fairies,
The atlas-eater with a jaw for news,
Bit out the mandrake with to-morrow's scream.
Then, penny-eyed, that gentlemen of wounds,
Old cock from nowheres and the heaven's egg,
With bones unbuttoned to the half-way winds,
Hatched from the windy salvage on one leg,
Scraped at my cradle in a walking word
That night of time under the Christward shelter:
I am the long world's gentleman, he said,
And share my bed with Capricorn and Cancer.
II
Death is all metaphors, shape in one history;
The child that sucketh long is shooting up,
The planet-ducted pelican of circles
Weans on an artery the gender's strip;
Child of the short spark in a shapeless country
Soon sets alight a long stick from the cradle;
The horizontal cross-bones of Abaddon,
You by the cavern over the black stairs,
Rung bone and blade, the verticals of Adam,
And, manned by midnight, Jacob to the stars.
Hairs of your head, then said the hollow agent,
Are but the roots of nettles and of feathers
Over these groundworks thrusting through a pavement
And hemlock-headed in the wood of weathers.
III
First there was the lamb on knocking knees
And three dead seasons on a climbing grave
That Adam's wether in the flock of horns,
Butt of the tree-tailed worm that mounted Eve,
Horned down with skullfoot and the skull of toes
On thunderous pavements in the garden time;
Rip of the vaults, I took my marrow-ladle
Out of the wrinkled undertaker's van,
And, Rip Van Winkle from a timeless cradle,
Dipped me breast-deep in the descending bone;
The black ram, shuffling of the year, old winter,
Alone alive among his mutton fold,
We rung our weathering changes on the ladder,
Said the antipodes, and twice spring chimed.
IV
What is the metre of the dictionary?
The size of genesis? the short spark's gender?
Shade without shape? the shape of Pharaoh's echo?
(My shape of age nagging the wounded whisper).
Which sixth of wind blew out the burning gentry?
(Questions are hunchbacks to the poker marrow).
What of a bamboo man among your acres?
Corset the boneyards for a crooked boy?
Button your bodice on a hump of splinters,
My camel's eyes will needle through the shroud.
Love's reflection of the mushroom features,
Stills snapped by night in the bread-sided field,
Once close-up smiling in the wall of pictures,
Arc-lamped thrown back upon the cutting flood.
V
And from the windy West came two-gunned Gabriel,
From Jesu's sleeve trumped up the king of spots,
The sheath-decked jacks, queen with a shuffled heart;
Said the fake gentleman in suit of spades,
Black-tongued and tipsy from salvation's bottle.
Rose my Byzantine Adam in the night.
For loss of blood I fell on Ishmael's plain,
Under the milky mushrooms slew my hunger,
A climbing sea from Asia had me down
And Jonah's Moby snatched me by the hair,
Cross-stroked salt Adam to the frozen angel
Pin-legged on pole-hills with a black medusa
By waste seas where the white bear quoted Virgil
And sirens singing from our lady's sea-straw.
VI
Cartoon of slashes on the tide-traced crater,
He in a book of water tallow-eyed
By lava's light split through the oyster vowels
And burned sea silence on a wick of words.
Pluck, cock, my sea eye, said medusa's scripture,
Lop, love, my fork tongue, said the pin-hilled nettle;
And love plucked out the stinging siren's eye,
Old cock from nowheres lopped the minstrel tongue
Till tallow I blew from the wax's tower
The fats of midnight when the salt was singing;
Adam, time's joker, on a witch of cardboard
Spelt out the seven seas, an evil index,
The bagpipe-breasted ladies in the deadweed
Blew out the blood gauze through the wound of manwax.
VII
Now stamp the Lord's Prayer on a grain of rice,
A Bible-leaved of all the written woods
Strip to this tree: a rocking alphabet,
Genesis in the root, the scarecrow word,
And one light's language in the book of trees.
Doom on deniers at the wind-turned statement.
Time's tune my ladies with the teats of music,
The scaled sea-sawers, fix in a naked sponge
Who sucks the bell-voiced Adam out of magic,
Time, milk, and magic, from the world beginning.
Time is the tune my ladies lend their heartbreak,
From bald pavilions and the house of bread
Time tracks the sound of shape on man and cloud,
On rose and icicle the ringing handprint.
VIII
This was the crucifixion on the mountain,
Time's nerve in vinegar, the gallow grave
As tarred with blood as the bright thorns I wept;
The world's my wound, God's Mary in her grief,
Bent like three trees and bird-papped through her shift,
With pins for teardrops is the long wound's woman.
This was the sky, Jack Christ, each minstrel angle
Drove in the heaven-driven of the nails
Till the three-coloured rainbow from my nipples
From pole to pole leapt round the snail-waked world.
I by the tree of thieves, all glory's sawbones,
Unsex the skeleton this mountain minute,
And by this blowcock witness of the sun
Suffer the heaven's children through my heartbeat.
IX
From the oracular archives and the parchment,
Prophets and fibre kings in oil and letter,
The lamped calligrapher, the queen in splints,
Buckle to lint and cloth their natron footsteps,
Draw on the glove of prints, dead Cairo's henna
Pour like a halo on the caps and serpents.
This was the resurrection in the desert,
Death from a bandage, rants the mask of scholars
Gold on such features, and the linen spirit
Weds my long gentleman to dusts and furies;
With priest and pharaoh bed my gentle wound,
World in the sand, on the triangle landscape,
With stones of odyssey for ash and garland
And rivers of the dead around my neck.
X
Let the tale's sailor from a Christian voyage
Atlaswise hold half-way off the dummy bay
Time's ship-racked gospel on the globe I balance:
So shall winged harbours through the rockbirds' eyes
Spot the blown word, and on the seas I image
December's thorn screwed in a brow of holly.
Let the first Peter from a rainbow's quayrail
Ask the tall fish swept from the bible east,
What rhubarb man peeled in her foam-blue channel
Has sown a flying garden round that sea-ghost?
Green as beginning, let the garden diving
Soar, with its two bark towers, to that Day
When the worm builds with the gold straws of venom
My nest of mercies in the rude, red tree.
Because the pleasure-bird whistles after the hot wires,
Shall the blind horse sing sweeter?
Convenient bird and beast lie lodged to suffer
The supper and knives of a mood.
In the sniffed and poured snow on the tip of the tongue of the year
That clouts the spittle like bubbles with broken rooms,
An enamoured man alone by the twigs of his eyes, two fires,
Camped in the drug-white shower of nerves and food,
Savours the lick of the times through a deadly wood of hair
In a wind that plucked a goose,
Nor ever, as the wild tongue breaks its tombs,
Rounds to look at the red, wagged root.
Because there stands, one story out of the bum city,
That frozen wife whose juices drift like a fixed sea
Secretly in statuary,
Shall I, struck on the hot and rocking street,
Not spin to stare at an old year
Toppling and burning in the muddle of towers and galleries
Like the mauled pictures of boys?
The salt person and blasted place
I furnish with the meat of a fable;
If the dead starve, their stomachs turn to tumble
An upright man in the antipodes
Or spray-based and rock-chested sea:
Over the past table I repeat this present grace.
I make this in a warring absence when
Each ancient, stone-necked minute of love's season
Harbours my anchored tongue, slips the quaystone,
When, praise is blessed, her pride in mast and fountain
Sailed and set dazzling by the handshaped ocean,
In that proud sailing tree with branches driven
Through the last vault and vegetable groyne,
And this weak house to marrow-columned heaven,
Is corner-cast, breath's rag, scrawled weed, a vain
And opium head, crow stalk, puffed, cut, and blown,
Or like the tide-looped breastknot reefed again
Or rent ancestrally the roped sea-hymen,
And, pride is last, is like a child alone
By magnet winds to her blind mother drawn,
Bread and milk mansion in a toothless town.
She makes for me a nettle's innocence
And a silk pigeon's guilt in her proud absence,
In the molested rocks the shell of virgins,
The frank, closed pearl, the sea-girls' lineaments
Glint in the staved and siren-printed caverns,
Is maiden in the shameful oak, omens
Whalebed and bulldance, the gold bush of lions,
Proud as a sucked stone and huge as sandgrains.
These are her contraries: the beast who follows
With priest's grave foot and hand of five assassins
Her molten flight up cinder-nesting columns,
Calls the starved fire herd, is cast in ice,
Lost in a limp-treed and uneating silence,
Who scales a hailing hill in her cold flintsteps
Falls on a ring of summers and locked noons.
I make a weapon of an ass's skeleton
And walk the warring sands by the dead town.
Cudgel great air, wreck east, and topple sundown,
Storm her sped heart, hang with beheaded veins
Its wringing shell, and let her eyelids fasten.
Destruction, picked by birds, brays through the jaw-bone,
And, for that murder's sake, dark with contagion
Like an approaching wave I sprawl to ruin.
Ruin, the room of errors, one rood dropped
Down the stacked sea and water-pillared shade,
Weighed in rock shroud, is my proud pyramid;
Where, wound in emerald linen and sharp wind,
The hero's head lies scraped of every legend,
Comes love's anatomist with sun-gloved hand
Who picks the live heart on a diamond.
'His mother's womb had a tongue that lapped up mud,'
Cried the topless, inchtaped lips from hank and hood
In that bright anchorground where I lay linened,
'A lizard darting with black venom's thread
Doubled, to fork him back, through the lockjaw bed
And the breath-white, curtained mouth of seed.'
'See,' drummed the taut masks, 'how the dead ascend:
In the groin's endless coil a man is tangled.'
These once-blind eyes have breathed a wind of visions,
The cauldron's root through this once-rindless hand
Fumed like a tree, and tossed a burning bird;
With loud, torn tooth and tail and cobweb drum
The crumpled packs fled past this ghost in bloom,
And, mild as pardon from a cloud of pride,
The terrible world my brother bares his skin.
Now in the cloud's big breast lie quiet countries,
Delivered seas my love from her proud place
Walks with no wound, nor lightning in her face,
A calm wind blows that raised the trees like hair
Once where the soft snow's blood was turned to ice.
And though my love pulls the pale, nippled air,
Prides of to-morrow suckling in her eyes,
Yet this I make in a forgiving presence.
When all my five and country senses see,
The fingers will forget green thumbs and mark
How, through the halfmoon's vegetable eye,
Husk of young stars and handfull zodiac,
Love in the frost is pared and wintered by,
The whispering ears will watch love drummed away
Down breeze and shell to a discordant beach,
And, lashed to syllables, the lynx tongue cry
That her fond wounds are mended bitterly.
My nostrils see her breath burn like a bush.
My one and noble heart has witnesses
In all love's countries, that will grope awake;
And when blind sleep drops on the spying senses,
The heart is sensual, though five eyes break.
We lying by seasand, watching yellow
And the grave sea, mock who deride
Who follow the red rivers, hollow
Alcove of words out of cicada shade,
For in this yellow grave of sand and sea
A calling for colour calls with the wind
That's grave and gay as grave and sea
Sleeping on either hand.
The lunar silences, the silent tide
Lapping the still canals, the dry tide-master
Ribbed between desert and water storm,
Should cure our ills of the water
With a one-coloured calm;
The heavenly music over the sand
Sounds with the grains as they hurry
Hiding the golden mountains and mansions
Of the grave, gay, seaside land.
Bound by a sovereign strip, we lie,
Watch yellow, wish for wind to blow away
The strata of the shore and drown red rock;
But wishes breed not, neither
Can we fend off rock arrival,
Lie watching yellow until the golden weather
Breaks, O my heart's blood, like a heart and hill.
It is the sinners' dust-tongued bell claps me to churches
When, with his torch and hourglass, like a sulpher priest,
His beast heel cleft in a sandal,
Time marks a black aisle kindle from the brand of ashes,
Grief with dishevelled hands tear out the altar ghost
And a firewind kill the candle.
Over the choir minute I hear the hour chant:
Time's coral saint and the salt grief drown a foul sepulchre
And a whirlpool drives the prayerwheel;
Moonfall and sailing emperor, pale as their tide-print,
Hear by death's accident the clocked and dashed-down spire
Strike the sea hour through bellmetal.
There is loud and dark directly under the dumb flame,
Storm, snow, and fountain in the weather of fireworks,
Cathedral calm in the pulled house;
Grief with drenched book and candle christens the cherub time
From the emerald, still bell; and from the pacing weather-cock
The voice of bird on coral prays.
Forever it is a white child in the dark-skinned summer
Out of the font of bone and plants at that stone tocsin
Scales the blue wall of spirits;
From blank and leaking winter sails the child in colour,
Shakes, in crabbed burial shawl, by sorcerer's insect woken,
Ding dong from the mute turrets.
I mean by time the cast and curfew rascal of our marriage,
At nightbreak born in the fat side, from an animal bed
In a holy room in a wave;
And all love's sinners in sweet cloth kneel to a hyleg image,
Nutmeg, civet, and sea-parsley serve the plagued groom and bride
Who have brought forth the urchin grief.
O make me a mask and a wall to shut from your spies
Of the sharp, enamelled eyes and the spectacled claws
Rape and rebellion in the nurseries of my face,
Gag of dumbstruck tree to block from bare enemies
The bayonet tongue in this undefended prayerpiece,
The present mouth, and the sweetly blown trumpet of lies,
Shaped in old armour and oak the countenance of a dunce
To shield the glistening brain and blunt the examiners,
And a tear-stained widower grief drooped from the lashes
To veil belladonna and let the dry eyes perceive
Others betray the lamenting lies of their losses
By the curve of the nude mouth or the laugh up the sleeve.
The spire cranes. Its statue is an aviary.
From the stone nest it does not let the feathery
Carved birds blunt their striking throats on the salt gravel,
Pierce the spilt sky with diving wing in weed and heel
An inch in froth. Chimes cheat the prison spire, pelter
In time like outlaw rains on that priest, water,
Time for the swimmers' hands, music for silver lock
And mouth. Both note and plume plunge from the spire's hook.
Those craning birds are choice for you, songs that jump back
To the built voice, or fly with winter to the bells,
But do not travel down dumb wind like prodigals.
After the funeral
(In memory of Ann Jones)
After the funeral, mule praises, brays,
Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap
Tap happily of one peg in the thick
Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black,
The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,
Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep,
Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat
In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves,
That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout,
After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles
In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern,
I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone
In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann
Whose hooded, fountain heart once fell in puddles
Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun
(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly
Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;
She would not have me sinking in the holy
Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep
And need no druid of her broken body).
But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all
The seas to service that her wood-tongued virtue
Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,
Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods
That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,
Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds.
Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue
With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull
Is carved from her in a room with a wet window
In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands
Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare
Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,
Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;
And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.
These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental
Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm,
Storm me forever over her grave until
The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love
And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill.
Once it was the colour of saying
Soaked my table the uglier side of a hill
With a capsized field where a school sat still
And a black and white patch of girls grew playing;
The gentle seaslides of saying I must undo
That all the charmingly drowned arise to cockcrow and kill.
When I whistled with mitching boys through a reservoir park
Where at night we stoned the cold and cuckoo
Lovers in the dirt of their leafy beds,
The shade of their trees was a word of many shades
And a lamp of lightning for the poor in the dark;
Now my saying shall be my undoing,
And every stone I wind off like a reel.
Not from this anger, anticlimax after
Refusal struck her loin and the lame flower
Bent like a beast to lap the singular floods
In a land strapped by hunger
Shall she receive a bellyful of weeds
And bear those tendril hands I touch across
The agonized, two seas.
Behind my head a square of sky sags over
The circular smile tossed from lover to lover
And the golden ball spins out of the skies;
Not from this anger after
Refusal struck like a bell under water
Shall her smile breed that mouth, behind the mirror,
That burns along my eyes.
How shall my animal
Whose wizard shape I trace in the cavernous skull,
Vessel of abscesses and exultation's shell,
Endure burial under the spelling wall,
The invoked, shrouding veil at the cap of the face,
Who should be furious,
Drunk as a vineyard snail, flailed like an octopus,
Roaring, crawling, quarrel
With the outside weathers,
The natural circle of the discovered skies
Draw down to its weird eyes?
How shall it magnetize,
Towards the studded male in a bent, midnight blaze
That melts the lionhead's heel and horseshoe of the heart,
A brute land in the cool top of the country days
To trot with a loud mate the haybeds of a mile,
Love and labour and kill
In quick, sweet, cruel light till the locked ground sprout out,
The black, burst sea rejoice,
The bowels turn turtle,
Claw of the crabbed veins squeeze from each red particle
The parched and raging voice?
Fishermen of mermen
Creep and harp on the tide, sinking their charmed, bent pin
With bridebait of gold bread, I with a living skein,
Tongue and ear in the thread, angle the temple-bound
Curl-locked and animal cavepools of spells and bone,
Trace out a tentacle,
Nailed with an open eye, in the bowl of wounds and weed
To clasp my fury on ground
And clap its great blood down;
Never shall beast be born to atlas the few seas
Or poise the day on a horn.
Sigh long, clay cold, lie shorn,
Cast high, stunned on gilled stone; sly scissors ground in frost
Clack through the thicket of strength, love hewn in pillars drops
With carved bird, saint, and sun, the wrackspiked maiden mouth
Lops, as a bush plumed with flames, the rant of the fierce eye,
Clips short the gesture of breath.
Die in red feathers when the flying heaven's cut,
And roll with the knocked earth:
Lie dry, rest robbed, my beast.
You have kicked from a dark den, leaped up the whinnying light,
And dug your grave in my breast.
The tombstone told when she died.
Her two surnames stopped me still.
A virgin married at rest.
She married in this pouring place,
That I struck one day by luck,
Before I heard in my mother's side
Or saw in the looking-glass shell
The rain through her cold heart speak
And the sun killed in her face.
More the thick stone cannot tell.
Before she lay on a stranger's bed
With a hand plunged through her hair,
Or that rainy tongue beat back
Through the devilish years and innocent deaths
To the room of a secret child,
Among men later I heard it said
She cried her white-dressed limbs were bare
And her red lips were kissed black,
She wept in her pain and made mouths,
Talked and tore though her eyes smiled.
I who saw in a hurried film
Death and this mad heroine
Meet once on a mortal wall
Heard her speak through the chipped beak
Of the stone bird guarding her:
I died before bedtime came
But my womb was bellowing
And I felt with my bare fall
A blazing red harsh head tear up
And the dear floods of his hair.
On no work of words now for three lean months in the bloody
Belly of the rich year and the big purse of my body
I bitterly take to task my poverty and craft:
To take to give is all, return what is hungrily given
Puffing the pounds of manna up through the dew to heaven,
The lovely gift of the gab bangs back on a blind shaft.
To lift to leave from treasures of man is pleasing death
That will rake at last all currencies of the marked breath
And count the taken, forsaken mysteries in a bad dark.
To surrender now is to pay the expensive ogre twice.
Ancient woods of my blood, dash down to the nut of the seas
If I take to burn or return this world which is each man's work.
A saint about to fall,
The stained flats of heaven hit and razed
To the kissed kite hems of his shawl,
On the last street wave praised
The unwinding, song by rock,
Of the woven wall
Of his father's house in the sands,
The vanishing of the musical ship-work and the chucked bells,
The wound-down cough of the blood-counting clock
Behind a face of hands,
On the angelic etna of the last whirring featherlands,
Wind-heeled foot in the hole of a fireball,
Hymned his shrivelling flock,
On the last rick's tip by spilled wine-wells
Sang heaven hungry and the quick
Cut Christbread spitting vinegar and all
The mazes of his praise and envious tongue were worked in flames and shells.
Glory cracked like a flea.
The sun-leaved holy candlewoods
Drivelled down to one singeing tree
With a stub of black buds,
The sweet, fish-gilled boats bringing blood
Lurched through a scuttled sea
With a hold of leeches and straws,
Heaven fell with his fall and one crocked bell beat the left air.
O wake in me in my house in the mud
Of the crotch of the squawking shores,
Flicked from the carbolic city puzzle in a bed of sores
The scudding base of the familiar sky,
The lofty roots of the clouds.
From an odd room in a split house stare,
Milk in your mouth, at the sour floods
That bury the sweet street slowly, see
The skull of the earth is barbed with a war of burning brains and hair.
Strike in the time-bomb town,
Raise the live rafters of the eardrum,
Throw your fear a parcel of stone
Through the dark asylum,
Lapped among herods wail
As their blade marches in
That the eyes are already murdered,
The stocked heart is forced, and agony has another mouth to feed.
O wake to see, after a noble fall,
The old mud hatch again, the horrid
Woe drip from the dishrag hands and the pressed sponge of the forehead,
The breath draw back like a bolt through white oil
And a stranger enter like iron.
Cry joy that hits witchlike midwife second
Bullies into rough seas you so gentle
And makes with a flick of the thumb and sun
A thundering bullring of your silent and girl-circled island.
'If my head hurt a hair's foot
Pack back the downed bone. If the unpricked ball of my breath
Bump on a spout let the bubbles jump out.
Sooner drop with the worm of the ropes round my throat
Than bully ill love in the clouted scene.
'All game phrases fit your ring of a cockfight:
I'll comb the snared woods with a glove on a lamp,
Peck, sprint, dance on fountains and duck time
Before I rush in a crouch the ghost with a hammer, air,
Strike light, and bloody a loud room.
'If my bunched, monkey coming is cruel
Rage me back to the making house. My hand unravel
When you sew the deep door. The bed is a cross place.
Bend, if my journey ache, direction like an arc or make
A limp and riderless shape to leap nine thinning months.'
'No. Not for Christ's dazzling bed
Or a nacreous sleep among soft particles and charms
My dear would I change my tears or your iron head.
Thrust, my daughter or son, to escape, there is none, none, none,
Nor when all ponderous heaven's host of waters breaks.
'Now to awake husked of gestures and my joy like a cave
To the anguish and carrion, to the infant forever unfree,
O my lost love bounced from a good home;
The grain that hurries this way from the rim of the grave
Has a voice and a house, and there and here you must couch and cry.
'Rest beyond choice in the dust-appointed grain,
At the breast stored with seas. No return
Through the waves of the fat streets nor the skeleton's thin ways.
The grave and my calm body are shut to your coming as stone,
And the endless beginning of prodigies suffers open.'
Twenty-four years remind the tears of my eyes.
(Bury the dead for fear that they walk to the grave in labour.)
In the groin of the natural doorway I crouched like a tailor
Sewing a shroud for a journey
By the light of the meat-eating sun.
Dressed to die, the sensual strut begun,
With my red veins full of money,
In the final direction of the elementary town
I advance for as long as forever is.
The conversation of prayers about to be said
By the child going to bed and the man on the stairs
Who climbs to his dying love in her high room,
The one not caring to whom in his sleep he will move
And the other full of tears that she will be dead,
Turns in the dark on the sound they know will arise
Into the answering skies from the green ground,
From the man on the stairs and the child by his bed.
The sound about to be said in the two prayers
For the sleep in a safe land and the love who dies
Will be the same grief flying. Whom shall they calm?
Shall the child sleep unharmed or the man be crying?
The conversation of prayers about to be said
Turns on the quick and the dead, and the man on the stairs
To-night shall find no dying but alive and warm
In the fire of his care his love in the high room.
And the child not caring to whom he climbs his prayer
Shall drown in a grief as deep as his true grave,
And mark the dark eyed wave, through the eyes of sleep,
Dragging him up the stairs to one who lies dead.
Never until the mankind making
Bird beast and flower
Fathering and all humbling darkness
Tells with silence the last light breaking
And the still hour
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness
And I must enter again the round
Zion of the water bead
And the synagogue of the ear of corn
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound
Or sow my salt seed
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn
The majesty and burning of the child's death.
I shall not murder
The mankind of her going with a grave truth
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath
With any further
Elegy of innocence and youth.
Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,
Robed in the long friends,
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,
Secret by the unmourning water
Of the riding Thames.
After the first death, there is no other.
    It was my thirtieth year to heaven
Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood
    And the mussel pooled and the heron
            Priested shore
        The morning beckon
With water praying and call of seagull and rook
And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall
        Myself to set foot
            That second
    In the still sleeping town and set forth.
    My birthday began with the water-
Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name
    Above the farms and the white horses
            And I rose
        In rainy autumn
And walked abroad in a shower of all my days.
High tide and the heron dived when I took the road
        Over the border
            And the gates
    Of the town closed as the town awoke.
    A springful of larks in a rolling
Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling
    Blackbirds and the sun of October
            Summery
        On the hill's shoulder,
Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly
Come in the morning where I wandered and listened
        To the rain wringing
            Wind blow cold
    In the wood faraway under me.
    Pale rain over the dwindling harbour
And over the sea wet church the size of a snail
    With its horns through mist and the castle
            Brown as owls
        But all the gardens
Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales
Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.
        There could I marvel
            My birthday
    Away but the weather turned around.
    It turned away from the blithe country
And down the other air and the blue altered sky
    Streamed again a wonder of summer
            With apples
        Pears and red currants
And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's
Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
        Through the parables
            Of sun light
    And the legends of the green chapels
    And the twice told fields of infancy
That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.
    These were the woods the river and sea
            Where a boy
        In the listening
Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.
        And the mystery
            Sang alive
    Still in the water and singingbirds.
    And there could I marvel my birthday
Away but the weather turned around. And the true
    Joy of the long dead child sang burning
            In the sun.
        It was my thirtieth
Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon
Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.
        O may my heart's truth
            Still be sung
    On this high hill in a year's turning.
This Side of the Truth
(for Llewelyn)
This side of the truth,
You may not see, my son,
King of your blue eyes
In the blinding country of youth,
That all is undone,
Under the unminding skies,
Of innocence and guilt
Before you move to make
One gesture of the heart or head,
Is gathered and spilt
Into the winding dark
Like the dust of the dead.
Good and bad, two ways
Of moving about your death
By the grinding sea,
King of your heart in the blind days,
Blow away like breath,
Go crying through you and me
And the souls of all men
Into the innocent
Dark, and the guilty dark, and good
Death, and bad death, and then
In the last element
Fly like the stars' blood
Like the sun's tears,
Like the moon's seed, rubbish
And fire, the flying rant
Of the sky, king of your six years.
And the wicked wish,
Down the beginning of plants
And animals and birds,
Water and light, the earth and sky,
Is cast before you move,
And all your deeds and words,
Each truth, each lie,
Die in unjudging love.
Friend by enemy I call you out.
You with a bad coin in your socket,
You my friend there with a winning air
Who palmed the lie on me when you looked
Brassily at my shyest secret,
Enticed with twinkling bits of the eye
Till the sweet tooth of my love bit dry,
Rasped at last, and I stumbled and sucked,
Whom now I conjure to stand as thief
In the memory worked by mirrors,
With unforgettably smiling act,
Quickness of hand in the velvet glove
And my whole heart under your hammer,
Were once such a creature, so gay and frank
A desireless familiar
I never thought to utter or think
While you displaced a truth in the air,
That though I loved them for their faults
As much as for their good,
My friends were enemies on stilts
With their heads in a cunning cloud.
                  A stranger has come
To share my room in the house not right in the head,
                  A girl mad as birds
Bolting the night of the door with her arm her plume.
                  Strait in the mazed bed
She deludes the heaven-proof house with entering clouds
Yet she deludes with walking the nightmarish room,
                  At large as the dead,
Or rides the imagined oceans of the male wards.
                  She has come possessed
Who admits the delusive light through the bouncing wall,
                  Possessed by the skies
She sleeps in the narrow trough yet she walks the dust
                  Yet raves at her will
On the madhouse boards worn thin by my walking tears.
And taken by light in her arms at long and dear last
                  I may without fail
Suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars.
Unluckily for a death
Waiting with phoenix under
The pyre yet to be lighted of my sins and days,
And for the woman in shades
Saint carved and sensual among the scudding
Dead and gone, dedicate forever to my self
Though the brawl of the kiss has not occurred
On the clay cold mouth, on the fire
Branded forehead, that could bind
Her constant, nor the winds of love broken wide
To the wind the choir and cloister
Of the wintry nunnery of the order of lust
Beneath my life, that sighs for the seducer's coming
In the sun strokes of summer,
Loving on this sea banged guilt
My holy lucky body
Under the cloud against love is caught and held and kissed
In the mill of the midst
Of the descending day, the dark our folly,
Cut to the still star in the order of the quick
But blessed by such heroic hosts in your every
Inch and glance that the wound
Is certain god, and the ceremony of souls
Is celebrated there, and communion between suns.
Never shall my self chant
About the saint in shades while the endless breviary
Turns of your prayed flesh, nor shall I shoo the bird below me:
The death biding two lie lonely.
I see the tigron in tears
In the androgynous dark,
His striped and noon maned tribe striding to holocaust,
The she mules bear their minotaurs,
The duck-billed platypus broody in a milk of birds.
I see the wanting nun saint carved in a garb
Of shades, symbol of desire beyond my hours
And guilts, great crotch and giant
Continence. I see the unfired phoenix, herald
And heaven crier, arrow now of aspiring
And the renouncing of islands.
All love but for the full assemblage in flower
Of the living flesh is monstrous or immortal,
And the grave its daughters.
Love, my fate got luckily,
Teaches with no telling
That the phoenix' bid for heaven and the desire after
Death in the carved nunnery
Both shall fail if I bow not to your blessing
Nor walk in the cool of your mortal garden
With immortality at my side like Christ the sky.
This I know from the native
Tongue of your translating eyes. The young stars told me,
Hurling into beginning like Christ the child.
Lucklessly she must lie patient
And the vaulting bird be still. O my true love, hold me.
In your every inch and glance is the globe of genesis spun,
And the living earth your sons.
The hunchback in the park
A solitary mister
Propped between trees and water
From the opening of the garden lock
That lets the trees and water enter
Until the Sunday sombre bell at dark
Eating bread from a newspaper
Drinking water from the chained cup
That the children filled with gravel
In the fountain basin where I sailed my ship
Slept at night in a dog kennel
But nobody chained him up.
Like the park birds he came early
Like the water he sat down
And Mister they called Hey mister
The truant boys from the town
Running when he had heard them clearly
On out of sound
Past lake and rockery
Laughing when he shook his paper
Hunchbacked in mockery
Through the loud zoo of the willow groves
Dodging the park keeper
With his stick that picked up leaves.
And the old dog sleeper
Alone between nurses and swans
While the boys among willows
Made the tigers jump out of their eyes
To roar on the rockery stones
And the groves were blue with sailors
Made all day until bell time
A woman figure without fault
Straight as a young elm
Straight and tall from his crooked bones
That she might stand in the night
After the locks and chains
All night in the unmade park
After the railings and shrubberies
The birds the grass the trees the lake
And the wild boys innocent as strawberries
Had followed the hunchback
To his kennel in the dark.
I
            Into her lying down head
            His enemies entered bed,
      Under the encumbered eyelid,
Through the rippled drum of the hair-buried ear;
And Noah's rekindled now unkind dove
            Flew man-bearing there.
      Last night in a raping wave
      Whales unreined from the green grave
In fountains of origin gave up their love,
      Along her innocence glided
Jaun aflame and savagely young King Lear,
            Queen Catherine howling bare
            And Samson drowned in his hair,
The colossal intimacies of silent
      Once seen strangers or shades on a stair;
There the dark blade and wanton sighing her down
To a haycock couch and the scythes of his arms
            Rode and whistled a hundred times
            Before the crowing morning climbed;
Man was the burning England she was sleep-walking, and the enamouring island
      Made her limbs blind by luminous charms,
Sleep to a newborn sleep in a swaddling loin-leaf stroked and sang
      And his runaway beloved childlike laid in the acorned sand.
II
            There where a numberless tongue
            Wound their room with a male moan,
      His faith around her flew undone
And darkness hung the walls with baskets of snakes,
A furnace-nostrilled column-membered
            Super-or-near man
      Resembling to her dulled sense
      The thief of adolescence,
Early imaginary half remembered
      Oceanic lover alone
Jealousy cannot forget for all her sakes,
            Made his bad bed in her good
            Night, and enjoyed as he would.
Crying, white gowned, from the middle moonlit stages
      Out to the tiered and hearing tide,
Close and far she announced the theft of the heart
In the taken body at many ages,
            Trespasser and broken bride
            Celebrating at her side
All blood-signed assailing and vanished marriages in which he had no lovely part
      Nor could share, for his pride, to the least
Mutter and foul wingbeat of the solemnizing nightpriest
Her holy unholy hours with the always anonymous beast.
III
            Two sand grains together in bed,
            Head to heaven-circling head,
      Singly lie with the whole wide shore,
The covering sea their nightfall with no names;
And out of every domed and soil-based shell
            One voice in chains declaims
      The female, deadly, and male
      Libidinous betrayal,
Golden dissolving under the water veil.
      A she bird sleeping brittle by
Her lover's wings that fold to-morrow's flight,
            Within the nested treefork
            Sings to the treading hawk
Carrion, paradise, chirrup my bright yolk.
      A blade of grass longs with the meadow,
A stone lies lost and locked in the lark-high hill.
Open as to the air to the naked shadow
            O she lies alone and still,
            Innocent between two wars,
With the incestuous secret brother in the seconds to perpetuate the stars,
      A man torn up mourns in the sole night.
And the second comers, the severers, the enemies from the deep
Forgotten dark, rest their pulse and bury their dead in her faithless sleep.
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
On almost the incendiary eve
  Of several near deaths,
When one at the great least of your best loved
  And always known must leave
Lions and fires of his flying breath,
  Of your immortal friends
Who'd raise the organs of the counted dust
  To shoot and sing your praise,
One who called deepest down shall hold his peace
  That cannot sink or cease
  Endlessly to his wound
In many married London's estranging grief.
On almost the incendiary eve
  When at your lips and keys,
Locking, unlocking, the murdered strangers weave,
  One who is most unknown,
Your polestar neighbour, sun of another street,
  Will dive up to his tears.
He'll bathe his raining blood in the male sea
  Who strode for your own dead
And wind his globe out of your water thread
  And load the throats of shells
  With every cry since light
Flashed first across his thunderclapping eyes.
On almost the incendiary eve
  Of deaths and entrances,
When near and strange wounded on London's waves
  Have sought your single grave,
One enemy, of many, who knows well
  Your heart is luminous
In the watched dark, quivering through locks and caves,
  Will pull the thunderbolts
To shut the sun, plunge, mount your darkened keys
  And sear just riders back,
  Until that one loved least
Looms the last Samson of your zodiac.
        It is a winter's tale
That the snow blind twilight ferries over the lakes
And floating fields from the farm in the cup of the vales,
Gliding windless through the hand folded flakes,
The pale breath of cattle at the stealthy sail,
        And the stars falling cold,
And the smell of hay in the snow, and the far owl
Warning among the folds, and the frozen hold
Flocked with the sheep white smoke of the farm house cowl
In the river wended vales where the tale was told.
        Once when the world turned old
On a star of faith pure as the drifting bread,
As the food and flames of the snow, a man unrolled
The scrolls of fire that burned in his heart and head,
Torn and alone in a farm house in a fold
        Of fields. And burning then
In his firelit island ringed by the winged snow
And the dung hills white as wool and the hen
Roosts sleeping chill till the flame of the cock crow
Combs through the mantled yards and the morning men
        Stumble out with their spades,
The cattle stirring, the mousing cat stepping shy,
The puffed birds hopping and hunting, the milkmaids
Gentle in their clogs over the fallen sky,
And all the woken farm at its white trades,
        He knelt, he wept, he prayed,
By the spit and the black pot in the log bright light
And the cup and the cut bread in the dancing shade,
In the muffled house, in the quick of night,
At the point of love, forsaken and afraid.
        He knelt on the cold stones,
He wept form the crest of grief, he prayed to the veiled sky
May his hunger go howling on bare white bones
Past the statues of the stables and the sky roofed sties
And the duck pond glass and the blinding byres alone
        Into the home of prayers
And fires where he should prowl down the cloud
Of his snow blind love and rush in the white lairs.
His naked need struck him howling and bowed
Though no sound flowed down the hand folded air
        But only the wind strung
Hunger of birds in the fields of the bread of water, tossed
In high corn and the harvest melting on their tongues.
And his nameless need bound him burning and lost
When cold as snow he should run the wended vales among
        The rivers mouthed in night,
And drown in the drifts of his need, and lie curled caught
In the always desiring centre of the white
Inhuman cradle and the bride bed forever sought
By the believer lost and the hurled outcast of light.
        Deliver him, he cried,
By losing him all in love, and cast his need
Alone and naked in the engulfing bride,
Never to flourish in the fields of the white seed
Or flower under the time dying flesh astride.
        Listen. The minstrels sing
In the departed villages. The nightingale,
Dust in the buried wood, flies on the grains of her wings
And spells on the winds of the dead his winter's tale.
The voice of the dust of water from the withered spring
        Is telling. The wizened
Stream with bells and baying water bounds. The dew rings
On the gristed leaves and the long gone glistening
Parish of snow. The carved mouths in the rock are wind swept strings.
Time sings through the intricately dead snow drop. Listen.
        It was a hand or sound
In the long ago land that glided the dark door wide
And there outside on the bread of the ground
A she bird rose and rayed like a burning bride.
A she bird dawned, and her breast with snow and scarlet downed.
        Look. And the dancers move
On the departed, snow bushed green, wanton in moon light
As a dust of pigeons. Exulting, the grave hooved
Horses, centaur dead, turn and tread the drenched white
Paddocks in the farms of birds. The dead oak walks for love.
        The carved limbs in the rock
Leap, as to trumpets. Calligraphy of the old
Leaves is dancing. Lines of age on the stones weave in a flock.
And the harp shaped voice of the water's dust plucks in a fold
Of fields. For love, the long ago she bird rises. Look.
        And the wild wings were raised
Above her folded head, and the soft feathered voice
Was flying through the house as though the she bird praised
And all the elements of the slow fall rejoiced
That a man knelt alone in the cup of the vales,
        In the mantle and calm,
By the spit and the black pot in the log bright light.
And the sky of birds in the plumed voice charmed
Him up and he ran like a wind after the kindling flight
Past the blind barns and byres of the windless farm.
        In the poles of the year
When black birds died like priests in the cloaked hedge row
And over the cloth of counties the far hills rode near,
Under the one leaved trees ran a scarecrow of snow
And fast through the drifts of the thickets antlered like deer,
        Rags and prayers down the knee-
Deep hillocks and loud on the numbed lakes,
All night lost and long wading in the wake of the she-
Bird through the times and lands and tribes of the slow flakes.
Listen and look where she sails the goose plucked sea,
        The sky, the bird, the bride,
The cloud, the need, the planted stars, the joy beyond
The fields of seed and the time dying flesh astride,
The heavens, the heaven, the grave, the burning font.
In the far ago land the door of his death glided wide,
        And the bird descended.
On a bread white hill over the cupped farm
And the lakes and floating fields and the river wended
Vales where he prayed to come to the last harm
And the home of prayers and fires, the tale ended.
        The dancing perishes
On the white, no longer growing green, and, minstrel dead,
The singing breaks in the snow shoed villages of wishes
That once cut the figures of birds on the deep bread
And over the glazed lakes skated the shapes of fishes
        Flying. The rite is shorn
Of nightingale and centaur dead horse. The springs wither
Back. Lines of age sleep on the stones till trumpeting dawn.
Exultation lies down. Time buries the spring weather
That belled and bounded with the fossil and the dew reborn.
        For the bird lay bedded
In a choir of wings, as though she slept or died,
And the wings glided wide and he was hymned and wedded,
And through the thighs of the engulfing bride,
The woman breasted and the heaven headed
        Bird, he was brought low,
Burning in the bride bed of love, in the whirl-
Pool at the wanting centre, in the folds
Of paradise, in the spun bud of the world.
And she rose with him flowering in her melting snow.
The sky is torn across
This ragged anniversary of two
Who moved for three years in tune
Down the long walks of their vows.
Now their love lies a loss
And Love and his patients roar on a chain;
From every tune or crater
Carrying cloud, Death strikes their house.
Too late in the wrong rain
They come together whom their love parted:
The windows pour into their heart
And the doors burn in their brain.
          There was a saviour
          Rarer than radium,
     Commoner than water, crueller than truth;
          Children kept from the sun
          Assembled at his tongue
     To hear the golden note turn in a groove,
Prisoners of wishes locked their eyes
In the jails and studies of his keyless smiles.
          The voice of children says
          From a lost wilderness
     There was calm to be done in his safe unrest,
          When hindering man hurt
          Man, animal, or bird
     We hid our fears in that murdering breath,
Silence, silence to do, when earth grew loud,
In lairs and asylums of the tremendous shout.
          There was glory to hear
          In the churches of his tears,
     Under his downy arm you sighed as he struck,
          O you who could not cry
          On to the ground when a man died
     Put a tear for joy in the unearthly flood
And laid your cheek against a cloud-formed shell:
Now in the dark there is only yourself and myself.
          Two proud, blacked brothers cry,
          Winter-locked side by side,
     To this inhospitable hollow year,
          O we who could not stir
          One lean sigh when we heard
     Greed on man beating near and fire neighbour
       But wailed and nested in the sky-blue wall
Now break a giant tear for the little known fall,
          For the drooping of homes
          That did not nurse our bones,
     Brave deaths of only ones but never found,
          Now see, alone in us,
          Our own true strangers' dust
     Ride through the doors of our unentered house.
Exiled in us we arouse the soft,
Unclenched, armless, silk and rough love that breaks all rocks.
Waking alone in a multitude of loves when morning's light
Surprised in the opening of her nightlong eyes
His golden yesterday asleep upon the iris
And this day's sun leapt up the sky out of her thighs
Was miraculous virginity old as loaves and fishes,
Though the moment of a miracle is unending lightning
And the shipyards of Galilee's footprints hide a navy of doves.
No longer will the vibrations of the sun desire on
Her deepsea pillow where once she married alone,
Her heart all ears and eyes, lips catching the avalanche
Of the golden ghost who ringed with his streams her mercury bone,
Who under the lids of her windows hoisted his golden luggage,
For a man sleeps where fire leapt down and she learns through his arm
That other sun, the jealous coursing of the unrivalled blood.
In my craft or sullen art
Exercised in the still night
When only the moon rages
And the lovers lie abed
With all their griefs in their arms,
I labour by singing light
Not for ambition or bread
Or the strut and trade of charms
On the ivory stages
But for the common wages
Of their most secret heart.
Not for the proud man apart
From the raging moon I write
On these spindrift pages
Nor for the towering dead
With their nightingales and psalms
But for the lovers, their arms
Round the griefs of the ages,
Who pay no praise or wages
Nor heed my craft or art.
I
Myselves
The grievers
Grieve
Among the street burned to tireless death
A child of a few hours
With its kneading mouth
Charred on the black breast of the grave
The mother dug, and its arms full of fires.
Begin
With singing
Sing
Darkness kindled back into beginning
When the caught tongue nodded blind,
A star was broken
Into the centuries of the child
Myselves grieve now, and miracles cannot atone.
Forgive
Us forgive
Us your death that myselves the believers
May hold it in a great flood
Till the blood shall spurt,
And the dust shall sing like a bird
As the grains blow, as your death grows, through our heart.
Crying
Your dying
Cry,
Child beyond cockcrow, by the fire-dwarfed
Street we chant the flying sea
In the body bereft.
Love is the last light spoken. Oh
Seed of sons in the loin of the black husk left.
II
I know not whether
Adam or Eve, the adorned holy bullock
Or the white ewe lamb
Or the chosen virgin
Laid in her snow
On the altar of London,
Was the first to die
In the cinder of the little skull,
O bride and bride groom
O Adam and Eve together
Lying in the lull
Under the sad breast of the head stone
White as the skeleton
Of the garden of Eden.
I know the legend
Of Adam and Eve is never for a second
Silent in my service
Over the dead infants
Over the one
Child who was priest and servants,
Word, singers, and tongue
In the cinder of the little skull,
Who was the serpent's
Night fall and the fruit like a sun,
Man and woman undone,
Beginning crumbled back to darkness
Bare as nurseries
Of the garden of wilderness.
III
Into the organpipes and steeples
Of the luminous cathedrals,
Into the weathercocks' molten mouths
Rippling in twelve-winded circles,
Into the dead clock burning the hour
Over the urn of sabbaths
Over the whirling ditch of daybreak
Over the sun's hovel and the slum of fire
And the golden pavements laid in requiems,
Into the bread in a wheatfield of flames,
Into the wine burning like brandy,
The masses of the sea
The masses of the sea under
The masses of the infant-bearing sea
Erupt, fountain, and enter to utter for ever
Glory glory glory
The sundering ultimate kingdom of genesis' thunder.
I
Once below a time,
When my pinned-around-the-spirit
Cut-to-measure flesh bit,
Suit for a serial sum
On the first of each hardship,
My paid-for slaved-for own too late
In love torn breeches and blistered jacket
On the snapping rims of the ashpit,
In grottoes I worked with birds,
Spiked with a mastiff collar,
Tasselled in cellar and snipping shop
Or decked on a cloud swallower,
Then swift from a bursting sea with bottlecork boats
And out-of-perspective sailors,
In common clay clothes disguised as scales,
As a he-god's paddling water skirts,
I astounded the sitting tailors,
I set back the clock faced tailors,
Then, bushily swanked in bear wig and tails,
Hopping hot leaved and feathered
From the kangaroo foot of the earth,
From the chill, silent centre
Trailing the frost bitten cloth,
Up through the lubber crust of Wales
I rocketed to astonish
The flashing needle rock of squatters,
The criers of Shabby and Shorten,
The famous stitch droppers.
II
My silly suit, hardly yet suffered for,
Around some coffin carrying
Birdman or told ghost I hung.
And the owl hood, the heel hider,
Claw fold and hole for the rotten
Head, deceived, I believed, my maker,
The cloud perched tailors' master with nerves for cotton.
On the old seas from stories, thrashing my wings,
Combing with antlers, Columbus on fire,
I was pierced by the idol tailor's eyes,
Glared through shark mask and navigating head,
Cold Nansen's beak on a boat full of gongs,
To the boy of common thread,
The bright pretender, the ridiculous sea dandy
With dry flesh and earth for adorning and bed.
It was sweet to drown in the readymade handy water
With my cherry capped dangler green as seaweed
Summoning a child's voice from a webfoot stone,
Never never oh never to regret the bugle I wore
On my cleaving arm as I blasted in a wave.
Now shown and mostly bare I would lie down,
Lie down, lie down and live
As quiet as a bone.
When I woke, the town spoke.
Birds and clocks and cross bells
Dinned aside the coiling crowd,
The reptile profligates in a flame,
Spoilers and pokers of sleep,
The next-door sea dispelled
Frogs and satans and woman-luck,
While a man outside with a billhook,
Up to his head in his blood,
Cutting the morning off,
The warm-veined double of Time
And his scarving beard from a book,
Slashed down the last snake as though
It were a wand or subtle bough,
Its tongue peeled in the wrap of a leaf.
Every morning I make,
God in bed, good and bad,
After a water-face walk,
The death-stagged scatter-breath
Mammoth and sparrowfall
Everybody's earth.
Where birds ride like leaves and boats like ducks
I heard, this morning, waking,
Crossly out of the town noises
A voice in the erected air,
No prophet-progeny of mine,
Cry my sea town was breaking.
No Time, spoke the clocks, no God, rang the bells,
I drew the white sheet over the islands
And the coins on my eyelids sang like shells.
When the morning was waking over the war
He put on his clothes and stepped out and he died,
The locks yawned loose and a blast blew them wide,
He dropped where he loved on the burst pavement stone
And the funeral grains of the slaughtered floor.
Tell his street on its back he stopped a sun
And the craters of his eyes grew springshots and fire
When all the keys shot from the locks, and rang.
Dig no more for the chains of his grey-haired heart.
The heavenly ambulance drawn by a wound
Assembling waits for the spade's ring on the cage.
O keep his bones away from the common cart,
The morning is flying on the wings of his age
And a hundred storks perch on the sun's right hand.
Lie still, sleep becalmed, sufferer with the wound
In the throat, burning and turning. All night afloat
On the silent sea we have heard the sound
That came from the wound wrapped in the salt sheet.
Under the mile off moon we trembled listening
To the sea sound flowing like blood from the loud wound
And when the salt sheet broke in a storm of singing
The voices of all the drowned swam on the wind.
Open a pathway through the slow sad sail,
Throw wide to the wind the gates of the wandering boat
For my voyage to begin to the end of my wound,
We heard the sea sound sing, we saw the salt sheet tell.
Lie still, sleep becalmed, hide the mouth in the throat,
Or we shall obey, and ride with you through the drowned.
I
                      Who
                    Are you
                  Who is born
               In the next room
             So  loud  to  my  own
           That I can hear the womb
         Opening  and  the  dark  run
      Over the ghost and the dropped son
    Behind the wall thin as a wren's bone?
      In the birth  bloody  room unknown
        To the  burn  and  turn of time
           And the heart print of man
              Bows   no   baptism
                But dark  alone
                  Blessing on
                    The wild
                     Child.
                       I
                    Must lie
                Still as  stone
              By  the  wren  bone
             Wall hearing the moan
           Of  the   mother   hidden
         And the shadowed head of pain
       Casting  to-morrow  like  a thorn
     And  the  midwives  of  miracle  sing
       Until  the  turbulent   new  born
        Burns me his name and his flame
          And the winged wall is torn
             By  his torrid  crown
              And the dark thrown
                From  his  loin
                   To bright
                     Light.
                     When
                  The   wren
               Bone writhes down
              And the first dawn
            Furied  by  his  stream
         Swarms  on the  kingdom come
       Of   the   dazzler   of   heaven
     And  the  splashed  mothering  maiden
    Who   bore  him   with  a   bonfire  in
     His mouth and rocked him like a storm
       I  shall   run  lost   in  sudden
         Terror   and   shining  from
            The  once  hooded  room
              Crying   in   vain
                In the  caldron
                   Of    his
                     Kiss
                      In
                   The spin
                 Of  the   sun
               In   the  spuming
            Cyclone   of  his  wing
          For  I  was  lost   who  am
       Crying at the man drenched throne
      In  the first  fury  of his  stream
    And   the   lightnings   of   adoration
      Back to black silence melt and mourn
       For  I was  lost  who  have  come
          To    dumbfounding    haven
            And  the   finding  one
               And the high noon
                 Of his wound
                   Blinds my
                      Cry.
                     There
                 Crouched bare
               In   the  shrine
              Of   his   blazing
           Breast  I   shall  waken
         To  the  judge  blown  bedlam
       Of   the   uncaged   sea   bottom
     The cloud  climb of the exhaling tomb
       And  the  bidden  dust  upsailing
         With his flame in every grain.
           O  spiral  of  ascension
            From the vultured urn
              Of   the   morning
                 Of  man  when
                   The  land
                      And
                      The
                    Born sea
                Praised the sun
              The  finding   one
            And    upright    Adam
          Sang      upon     origin!
        O the  wings  of  the children!
      The woundward flight of the ancient
    Young  from  the  canyons  of oblivion!
      The sky stride  of the always slain
        In   battle!    the   happening
          Of saints to  their vision!
            The world winding home!
              And the whole pain
                Flows     open
                     And I
                      Die.
II
    In the name  of the  lost who glory in
      The  swinish  plains   of  carrion
        Under    the    burial    song
          Of  the  birds  of  burden
            Heavy with the drowned
              And the green dust
                 And   bearing
                  The  ghost
                     From
                  The ground
                 Like  pollen
              On the black plume
            And the beak  of slime
          I  pray  though  I  belong
        Not wholly  to that  lamenting
      Brethren for joy  has moved within
    The inmost  marrow of  my  heart  bone
    That he who learns now the sun and moon
      Of  his  mother's  milk  may return
        Before the lips blaze and bloom
           To the  birth bloody room
             Behind the wall's wren
                Bone and be dumb
                  And the womb
                   That bore
                      For
                    All men
                  The  adored
                Infant light or
             The  dazzling  prison
           Yawn  to   his  upcoming.
         In  the  name  of  the  wanton
      Lost on  the unchristened  mountain
    In  the  centre  of  dark  I  pray  him
    That he let the dead lie though they moan
      For his briared hands  to hoist them
       To the shrine of his world's wound
          And the blood drop's garden
             Endure   the    stone
              Blind host to sleep
                 In  the  dark
                    And deep
                      Rock
                     Awake
                 No heart bone
              But  let  it  break
             On the mountain crown
          Unbidden    by    the   sun
       And  the  beating  dust be  blown
      Down  to  the  river  rooting plain
    Under   the   night   forever   falling.
   Forever   falling    night   is   a  known
     Star   and   country   to  the  legion
       Of sleepers  whose  tongue I  toll
         To    mourn    his    deluging
           Light through sea and soil
              And  we  have  come
                  To know all
                     Places
                      Ways
                     Mazes
                    Passages
              Quarters and graves
           Of   the   endless   fall.
         Now       common       lazarus
       Of  the  charting  sleepers  prays
     Never    to     awake     and    arise
  For the country of death is the heart's size
  And the star of the lost the shape of the eyes.
     In     the    name   of   the  fatherless
       In   the   name    of   the   unborn
         And       the       undesirers
           Of   midwiving   morning's
             Hands  or  instruments
                O  in  the  name
                   Of no  one
                     Now or
                       No
                     One to
                   Be I pray
                May the crimson
             Sun spin a grave grey
           And  the  colour  of  clay
         Stream  upon   his   martyrdom
      In     the     interpreted   evening
   And  the  known  dark  of  the  earth  amen.
    I turn the  corner of prayer and  burn
      In  a  blessing   of  the   sudden
        Sun. In the name of the damned
         I  would  turn back and  run
           To   the   hidden   land
              But  the  loud  sun
                 Christens down
                    The sky.
                       I
                   Am found.
                 O   let   him
              Scald me and drown
           Me in his world's wound.
         His  lightning  answers  my
       Cry. My voice burns in his hand.
      Now  I  am  lost  in the  blinding
    One. The sun roars at the prayer's end.
The bows glided down, and the coast
Blackened with birds took a last look
At his thrashing hair and whale-blue eye;
The trodden town rang its cobbles for luck.
Then good-bye to the fishermanned
Boat with its anchor free and fast
As a bird hooking over the sea,
High and dry by the top of the mast,
Whispered the affectionate sand
And the bulwarks of the dazzled quay.
For my sake sail, and never look back,
Said the looking land.
Sails drank the wind, and white as milk
He sped into the drinking dark;
The sun shipwrecked west on a pearl
And the moon swam out of its hulk.
Funnels and masts went by in a whirl.
Good-bye to the man on the sea-legged deck
To the gold gut that sings on his reel
To the bait that stalked out of the sack,
For we saw him throw to the swift flood
A girl alive with his hooks through her lips;
All the fishes were rayed in blood,
Said the dwindling ships.
Good-bye to chimneys and funnels,
Old wives that spin in the smoke,
He was blind to the eyes of candles
In the praying windows of waves
But heard his bait buck in the wake
And tussle in a shoal of loves.
Now cast down your rod, for the whole
Of the sea is hilly with whales,
She longs among horses and angels,
The rainbow-fish bend in her joys,
Floated the lost cathedral
Chimes of the rocked buoys.
Where the anchor rode like a gull
Miles over the moonstruck boat
A squall of birds bellowed and fell,
A cloud blew the rain from its throat;
He saw the storm smoke out to kill
With fuming bows and ram of ice,
Fire on starlight, rake Jesu's stream;
And nothing shone on the water's face
But the oil and bubble of the moon,
Plunging and piercing in his course
The lured fish under the foam
Witnessed with a kiss.
Whales in the wake like capes and Alps
Quaked the sick sea and snouted deep,
Deep the great bushed bait with raining lips
Slipped the fins of those humpbacked tons
And fled their love in a weaving dip.
Oh, Jericho was falling in their lungs!
She nipped and dived in the nick of love,
Spun on a spout like a long-legged ball
Till every beast blared down in a swerve
Till every turtle crushed from his shell
Till every bone in the rushing grave
Rose and crowed and fell!
Good luck to the hand on the rod,
There is thunder under its thumbs;
Gold gut is a lightning thread,
His fiery reel sings off its flames,
The whirled boat in the burn of his blood
Is crying from nets to knives,
Oh the shearwater birds and their boatsized brood
Oh the bulls of Biscay and their calves
Are making under the green, laid veil
The long-legged beautiful bait their wives.
Break the black news and paint on a sail
Huge weddings in the waves,
Over the wakeward-flashing spray
Over the gardens of the floor
Clash out the mounting dolphin's day,
My mast is a bell-spire,
Strike and smoothe, for my decks are drums,
Sing through the water-spoken prow
The octopus walking into her limbs
The polar eagle with his tread of snow.
From salt-lipped beak to the kick of the stern
Sing how the seal has kissed her dead!
The long, laid minute's bride drifts on
Old in her cruel bed.
Over the graveyard in the water
Mountains and galleries beneath
Nightingale and hyena
Rejoicing for that drifting death
Sing and howl through sand and anemone
Valley and sahara in a shell,
Oh all the wanting flesh his enemy
Thrown to the sea in the shell of a girl
Is old as water and plain as an eel;
Always good-bye to the long-legged bread
Scattered in the paths of his heels
For the salty birds fluttered and fed
And the tall grains foamed in their bills;
Always good-bye to the fires of the face,
For the crab-backed dead on the sea-bed rose
And scuttled over her eyes,
The blind, clawed stare is cold as sleet.
The tempter under the eyelid
Who shows to the selves asleep
Mast-high moon-white women naked
Walking in wishes and lovely for shame
Is dumb and gone with his flame of brides.
Sussanah's drowned in the bearded stream
And no-one stirs at Sheba's side
But the hungry kings of the tides;
Sin who had a woman's shape
Sleeps till Silence blows on a cloud
And all the lifted waters walk and leap.
Lucifer that bird's dropping
Out of the sides of the north
Has melted away and is lost
Is always lost in her vaulted breath,
Venus lies star-struck in her wound
And the sensual ruins make
Seasons over the liquid world,
White springs in the dark.
Always good-bye, cried the voices through the shell,
Good-bye always, for the flesh is cast
And the fisherman winds his reel
With no more desire than a ghost.
Always good luck, praised the finned in the feather
Bird after dark and the laughing fish
As the sails drank up the hail of thunder
And the long-tailed lightning lit his catch.
The boat swims into the six-year weather,
A wind throws a shadow and it freezes fast.
See what the gold gut drags from under
Mountains and galleries to the crest!
See what clings to hair and skull
As the boat skims on with drinking wings!
The statues of great rain stand still,
And the flakes fall like hills.
Sing and strike his heavy haul
Toppling up the boatside in a snow of light!
His decks are drenched with miracles.
Oh miracle of fishes! The long dead bite!
Out of the urn a size of a man
Out of the room the weight of his trouble
Out of the house that holds a town
In the continent of a fossil
One by one in dust and shawl,
Dry as echoes and insect-faced,
His fathers cling to the hand of the girl
And the dead hand leads the past,
Leads them as children and as air
On to the blindly tossing tops;
The centuries throw back their hair
And the old men sing from newborn lips:
_Time is bearing another son.
Kill Time! She turns in her pain!
The oak is felled in the acorn
And the hawk in the egg kills the wren._
He who blew the great fire in
And died on a hiss of flames
Or walked the earth in the evening
Counting the denials of the grains
Clings to her drifting hair, and climbs;
And he who taught their lips to sing
Weeps like the risen sun among
The liquid choirs of his tribes.
The rod bends low, divining land,
And through the sundered water crawls
A garden holding to her hand
With birds and animals
With men and women and waterfalls
Trees cool and dry in the whirlpool of ships
And stunned and still on the green, laid veil
Sand with legends in its virgin laps
And prophets loud on the burned dunes;
Insects and valleys hold her thighs hard,
Times and places grip her breast bone,
She is breaking with seasons and clouds;
Round her trailed wrist fresh water weaves,
with moving fish and rounded stones
Up and down the greater waves
A separate river breathes and runs;
Strike and sing his catch of fields
For the surge is sown with barley,
The cattle graze on the covered foam,
The hills have footed the waves away,
With wild sea fillies and soaking bridles
With salty colts and gales in their limbs
All the horses of his haul of miracles
Gallop through the arched, green farms,
Trot and gallop with gulls upon them
And thunderbolts in their manes.
O Rome and Sodom To-morrow and London
The country tide is cobbled with towns
And steeples pierce the cloud on her shoulder
And the streets that the fisherman combed
When his long-legged flesh was a wind on fire
And his loin was a hunting flame
Coil from the thoroughfares of her hair
And terribly lead him home alive
Lead her prodigal home to his terror,
The furious ox-killing house of love.
Down, down, down, under the ground,
Under the floating villages,
Turns the moon-chained and water-wound
Metropolis of fishes,
There is nothing left of the sea but its sound,
Under the earth the loud sea walks,
In deathbeds of orchards the boat dies down
And the bait is drowned among hayricks,
Land, land, land, nothing remains
Of the pacing, famous sea but its speech,
And into its talkative seven tombs
The anchor dives through the floors of a church.
Good-bye, good luck, struck the sun and the moon,
To the fisherman lost on the land.
He stands alone in the door of his home,
With his long-legged heart in his hand.
                            O
          Out of a bed of love
When that immortal hospital made one more move to soothe
          The cureless counted body,
                And ruin and his causes
Over the barbed and shooting sea assumed an army
          And swept into our wounds and houses,
I climb to greet the war in which I have no heart but only
          That one dark I owe my light,
Call for confessor and wiser mirror but there is none
          To glow after the god stoning night
And I am struck as lonely as a holy marker by the sun.
                            No
          Praise that the spring time is all
Gabriel and radiant shrubbery as the morning grows joyful
                Out of the woebegone pyre
And the multitude's sultry tear turns cool on the weeping wall,
          My arising prodigal
Sun the father his quiver full of the infants of pure fire,
          But blessed be hail and upheaval
That uncalm still it is sure alone to stand and sing
          Alone in the husk of man's home
And the mother and toppling house of the holy spring,
          If only for a last time.
Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
    The night above the dingle starry,
        Time let me hail and climb
    Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
        Trail with daisies and barley
    Down the rivers of the windfall light.
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
    In the sun that is young once only,
        Time let me play and be
    Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
        And the sabbath rang slowly
    In the pebbles of the holy streams.
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
    And playing, lovely and watery
        And fire green as grass.
    And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
    Flying with the ricks, and the horses
        Flashing into the dark.
And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
    Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
        The sky gathered again
    And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
    Out of the whinnying green stable
        On to the fields of praise.
And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
    In the sun born over and over,
        I ran my heedless ways,
    My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
    Before the children green and golden
        Follow him out of grace.
Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
    In the moon that is always rising,
        Nor that riding to sleep
    I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
        Time held me green and dying
    Though I sang in my chains like the sea.
I
Never and never, my girl riding far and near
In the land of the hearthstone tales, and spelled asleep,
Fear or believe that the wolf in a sheepwhite hood
Loping and bleating roughly and blithely shall leap,
                                         My dear, my dear,
Out of a lair in the flocked leaves in the dew dipped year
To eat your heart in the house in the rosy wood.
Sleep, good, for ever, slow and deep, spelled rare and wise,
My girl ranging the night in the rose and shire
Of the hobnail tales: no gooseherd or swine will turn
Into a homestall king or hamlet of fire
                                         And prince of ice
To court the honeyed heart from your side before sunrise
In a spinney of ringed boys and ganders, spike and burn,
Nor the innocent lie in the rooting dingle wooed
And staved, and riven among plumes my rider weep.
From the broomed witch's spume you are shielded by fern
And flower of country sleep and the greenwood keep.
                                         Lie fast and soothed,
Safe be and smooth from the bellows of the rushy brood.
Never, my girl, until tolled to sleep by the stern
Bell believe or fear that the rustic shade or spell
Shall harrow and snow the blood while you ride wide and near,
For who unmanningly haunts the mountain ravened eaves
Or skulks in the dell moon but moonshine echoing clear
                                         From the starred well?
A hill touches an angel. Out of a saint's cell
The nightbird lauds through nunneries and domes of leaves
Her robin breasted tree, three Marys in the rays.
_Sanctum sanctorum_ the animal eye of the wood
In the rain telling its beads, and the gravest ghost
The owl at its knelling. Fox and holt kneel before blood.
                                         Now the tales praise
The star rise at pasture and nightlong the fables graze
On the lord's-table of the bowing grass. Fear most
For ever of all not the wolf in his baaing hood
Nor the tusked prince, in the ruttish farm, at the rind
And mire of love, but the Thief as meek as the dew.
The country is holy: O bide in that country kind,
                                         Know the green good,
Under the prayer wheeling moon in the rosy wood
Be shielded by chant and flower and gay may you
Lie in grace. Sleep spelled at rest in the lowly house
In the squirrel nimble grove, under linen and thatch
And star: held and blessed, though you scour the high four
Winds, from the dousing shade and the roarer at the latch,
                                         Cool in your vows.
Yet out of the beaked, web dark and the pouncing boughs
Be you sure the Thief will seek a way sly and sure
And sly as snow and meek as dew blown to the thorn,
This night and each vast night until the stern bell talks
In the tower and tolls to sleep over the stalls
Of the hearthstone tales my own, lost love; and the soul walks
                                         The waters shorn.
This night and each night since the falling star you were born,
Ever and ever he finds a way, as the snow falls,
As the rain falls, hail on the fleece, as the vale mist rides
Through the haygold stalls, as the dew falls on the wind-
Milled dust of the apple tree and the pounded islands
Of the morning leaves, as the star falls, as the winged
                                         Apple seed glides,
And falls, and flowers in the yawning wound at our sides,
As the world falls, silent as the cyclone of silence.
II
Night and the reindeer on the clouds above the haycocks
And the wings of the great roc ribboned for the fair!
The leaping saga of prayer! And high, there, on the hare-
                                         Heeled winds the rooks
Cawing from their black bethels soaring, the holy books
Of birds! Among the cocks like fire the red fox
Burning! Night and the vein of birds in the winged, sloe wrist
Of the wood! Pastoral beat of blood through the laced leaves!
The stream from the priest black wristed spinney and sleeves
                                         Of thistling frost
Of the nightingale's din and tale! The upgiven ghost
Of the dingle torn to singing and the surpliced
Hill of cypresses! The din and tale in the skimmed
Yard of the buttermilk rain on the pail! The sermon
Of blood! The bird loud vein! The saga from mermen
                                         To seraphim
Leaping! The gospel rooks! All tell, this night, of him
Who comes as red as the fox and sly as the heeled wind.
Illumination of music! the lulled black-backed
Gull, on the wave with sand in its eyes! And the foal moves
Through the shaken greensward lake, silent, on moonshod hooves,
                                         In the winds' wakes.
Music of elements, that a miracle makes!
Earth, air, water, fire, singing into the white act,
The haygold haired, my love asleep, and the rift blue
Eyed, in the haloed house, in her rareness and hilly
High riding, held and blessed and true, and so stilly
                                         Lying the sky
Might cross its planets, the bell weep, night gather her eyes,
The Thief fall on the dead like the willy nilly dew,
Only for the turning of the earth in her holy
Heart! Slyly, slowly, hearing the wound in her side go
Round the sun, he comes to my love like the designed snow,
                                         And truly he
Flows to the strand of flowers like the dew's ruly sea,
And surely he sails like the ship shape clouds. Oh he
Comes designed to my love to steal not her tide raking
Wound, nor her riding high, nor her eyes, nor kindled hair,
But her faith that each vast night and the saga of prayer
                                         He comes to take
Her faith that this last night for his unsacred sake
He comes to leave her in the lawless sun awaking
Naked and forsaken to grieve he will not come.
Ever and ever by all your vows believe and fear
My dear this night he comes and night without end my dear
                                         Since you were born:
And you shall wake, from country sleep, this dawn and each first dawn,
Your faith as deathless as the outcry of the ruled sun.
Over Sir John's hill,
The hawk on fire hangs still;
In a hoisted cloud, at drop of dusk, he pulls to his claws
And gallows, up the rays of his eyes the small birds of the bay
And the shrill child's play
Wars
Of the sparrows and such who swansing, dusk, in wrangling hedges.
And blithely they squawk
To fiery tyburn over the wrestle of elms until
The flash the noosed hawk
Crashes, and slowly the fishing holy stalking heron
In the river Towy below bows his tilted headstone.
Flash, and the plumes crack,
And a black cap of jack-
Daws Sir John's just hill dons, and again the gulled birds hare
To the hawk on fire, the halter height, over Towy's fins,
In a whack of wind.
There
Where the elegiac fisherbird stabs and paddles
In the pebbly dab-filled
Shallow and sedge, and 'dilly dilly,' calls the loft hawk,
'Come and be killed,'
I open the leaves of the water at a passage
Of psalms and shadows among the pincered sandcrabs prancing
And read, in a shell
Death clear as a bouy's bell:
All praise of the hawk on fire in hawk-eyed dusk be sung,
When his viperish fuse hangs looped with flames under the brand
Wing, and blest shall
Young
Green chickens of the bay and bushes cluck, 'dilly dilly,
Come let us die.'
We grieve as the blithe birds, never again, leave shingle and elm,
The heron and I,
I young Aesop fabling to the near night by the dingle
Of eels, saint heron hymning in the shell-hung distant
Crystal harbour vale
Where the sea cobbles sail,
And wharves of water where the walls dance and the white cranes stilt.
It is the heron and I, under judging Sir John's elmed
Hill, tell-tale the knelled
Guilt
Of the led-astray birds whom God, for their breast of whistles,
Have Mercy on,
God in his whirlwind silence save, who marks the sparrows hail,
For their souls' song.
Now the heron grieves in the weeded verge. Through windows
Of dusk and water I see the tilting whispering
Heron, mirrored, go,
As the snapt feathers snow,
Fishing in the tear of the Towy. Only a hoot owl
Hollows, a grassblade blown in cupped hands, in the looted elms
And no green cocks or hens
Shout
Now on Sir John's hill. The heron, ankling the scaly
Lowlands of the waves,
Makes all the music; and I who hear the tune of the slow,
Wear-willow river, grave,
Before the lunge of the night, the notes on this time-shaken
Stone for the sake of the souls of the slain birds sailing.
  In the mustardseed sun,
By full tilt river and switchback sea
  Where the cormorants scud,
In his house on stilts high among beaks
  And palavers of birds
This sandgrain day in the bent bay's grave
  He celebrates and spurns
His driftwood thirty-fifth wind turned age;
  Herons spire and spear.
  Under and round him go
Flounders, gulls, on their cold, dying trails,
  Doing what they are told,
Curlews aloud in the congered waves
  Work at their ways to death,
And the rhymer in the long tongued room,
  Who tolls his birthday bell,
Toils towards the ambush of his wounds;
  Herons, steeple stemmed, bless.
  In the thistledown fall,
He sings towards anguish; finches fly
  In the claw tracks of hawks
On a seizing sky; small fishes glide
  Through wynds and shells of drowned
Ship towns to pastures of otters. He
  In his slant, racking house
And the hewn coils of his trade perceives
  Herons walk in their shroud,
  The livelong river's robe
Of minnows wreathing around their prayer;
  And far at sea he knows,
Who slaves to his crouched, eternal end
  Under a serpent cloud,
Dolphins dive in their turnturtle dust,
  The rippled seals streak down
To kill and their own tide daubing blood
  Slides good in the sleek mouth.
  In a cavernous, swung
Wave's silence, wept white angelus knells.
  Thirty-five bells sing struck
On skull and scar where his loves lie wrecked,
  Steered by the falling stars.
And to-morrow weeps in a blind cage
  Terror will rage apart
Before chains break to a hammer flame
  And love unbolts the dark
  And freely he goes lost
In the unknown, famous light of great
  And fabulous, dear God.
Dark is a way and light is a place,
  Heaven that never was
Nor will be ever is always true,
  And, in that brambled void,
Plenty as blackberries in the woods
  The dead grow for His joy.
  There he might wander bare
With the spirits of the horseshoe bay
  Or the stars' seashore dead,
Marrow of eagles, the roots of whales
  And wishbones of wild geese,
With blessed, unborn God and His Ghost,
  And every soul His priest,
Gulled and chanter in young Heaven's fold
  Be at cloud quaking peace,
  But dark is a long way.
He, on the earth of the night, alone
  With all the living, prays,
Who knows the rocketing wind will blow
  The bones out of the hills,
And the scythed boulders bleed, and the last
  Rage shattered waters kick
Masts and fishes to the still quick stars,
  Faithlessly unto Him
  Who is the light of old
And air shaped Heaven where souls grow wild
  As horses in the foam:
Oh, let me midlife mourn by the shrined
  And druid herons' vows
The voyage to ruin I must run,
  Dawn ships clouted aground,
Yet, though I cry with tumbledown tongue,
  Count my blessings aloud:
  Four elements and five
Senses, and man a spirit in love
  Tangling through this spun slime
To his nimbus bell cool kingdom come
  And the lost, moonshine domes,
And the sea that hides his secret selves
  Deep in its black, base bones,
Lulling of spheres in the seashell flesh,
  And this last blessing most,
  That the closer I move
To death, one man through his sundered hulks,
  The louder the sun blooms
And the tusked, ramshackling sea exults;
  And every wave of the way
And gale I tackle, the whole world then,
  With more triumphant faith
Than ever was since the world was said,
  Spins its morning of praise,
  I hear the bouncing hills
Grow larked and greener at berry brown
  Fall and the dew larks sing
Taller this thunderclap spring, and how
  More spanned with angles ride
The mansouled fiery islands! Oh,
  Holier then their eyes,
And my shining men no more alone
  As I sail out to die.
When I was a windy boy and a bit
And the black spit of the chapel fold,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of women),
I tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood,
The rude owl cried like a telltale tit,
I skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled
Ninepin down on donkey's common,
And on seesaw sunday nights I wooed
Whoever I would with my wicked eyes,
The whole of the moon I could love and leave
All the green leaved little weddings' wives
In the coal black bush and let them grieve.
When I was a gusty man and a half
And the black beast of the beetles' pews,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of bitches),
Not a boy and a bit in the wick-
Dipping moon and drunk as a new dropped calf,
I whistled all night in the twisted flues,
Midwives grew in the midnight ditches,
And the sizzling beds of the town cried, Quick!--
Whenever I dove in a breast high shoal,
Wherever I ramped in the clover quilts,
Whatsoever I did in the coal-
Black night, I left my quivering prints.
When I was a man you could call a man
And the black cross of the holy house,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of welcome),
Brandy and ripe in my bright, bass prime,
No springtailed tom in the red hot town
With every simmering woman his mouse
But a hillocky bull in the swelter
Of summer come in his great good time
To the sultry, biding herds, I said,
Oh, time enough when the blood creeps cold,
And I lie down but to sleep in bed,
For my sulking, skulking, coal black soul!
When I was half the man I was
And serve me right as the preachers warn,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of downfall),
No flailing calf or cat in a flame
Or hickory bull in milky grass
But a black sheep with a crumpled horn,
At last the soul from its foul mousehole
Slunk pouting out when the limp time came;
And I gave my soul a blind, slashed eye,
Gristle and rind, and a roarers' life,
And I shoved it into the coal black sky
To find a woman's soul for a wife.
Now I am a man no more no more
And a black reward for a roaring life,
(Sighed the old ram rod, dying of strangers),
Tidy and cursed in my dove cooed room
I lie down thin and hear the good bells jaw--
For, oh, my soul found a sunday wife
In the coal black sky and she bore angels!
Harpies around me out of her womb!
Chastity prays for me, piety sings,
Innocence sweetens my last black breath,
Modesty hides my thighs in her wings,
And all the deadly virtues plague my death!
Through throats where many rivers meet, the curlews cry,
Under the conceiving moon, on the high chalk hill,
And there this night I walk in the white giant's thigh
Where barren as boulders women lie longing still
To labour and love though they lay down long ago.
Through throats where many many rivers meet, the women pray,
Pleading in the waded bay for the seed to flow
Though the names on their weed grown stones are rained away,
And alone in the night's eternal, curving act
They yearn with tongues of curlews for the unconceived
And immemorial sons of the cudgelling, hacked
Hill. Who once in gooseskin winter loved all ice leaved
In the courters' lanes, or twined in the ox roasting sun
In the wains tonned so high that the wisps of the hay
Clung to the pitching clouds, or gay with any one
Young as they in the after milking moonlight lay
Under the lighted shapes of faith and their moonshade
Petticoats galed high, or shy with the rough riding boys,
Now clasp me to their grains in the gigantic glade,
Who once, green countries since, were a hedgerow of joys.
Time by, their dust was flesh the swineherd rooted sly,
Flared in the reek of the wiving sty with the rush
Light of his thighs, spreadeagle to the dunghill sky,
Or with their orchard man in the core of the sun's bush
Rough as cows' tongues and thrashed with brambles their buttermilk
Manes, under the quenchless summer barbed gold to the bone,
Or rippling soft in the spinney moon as the silk
And ducked and draked white lake that harps to a hail stone.
Who once were a bloom of wayside brides in the hawed house
And heard the lewd, wooed field flow to the coming frost,
The scurrying, furred small friars squeal, in the dowse
Of day, in the thistle aisles, till the white owl crossed
Their breast, the vaulting does roister, the horned bucks climb
Quick in the wood at love, where a torch of foxes foams,
All birds and beasts of the linked night uproar and chime
And the mole snout blunt under his pilgrimage of domes,
Or, butter fat goosegirls, bounced in a gambo bed,
Their breasts full of honey, under their gander king
Trounced by his wings in the hissing shippen, long dead
And gone that barley dark where their clogs danced in the spring,
And their firefly hairpins flew, and the ricks ran round--
(But nothing bore, no mouthing babe to the veined hives
Hugged, and barren and bare on Mother Goose's ground
They with the simple Jacks were a boulder of wives)--
Now curlew cry me down to kiss the mouths of their dust.
The dust of their kettles and clocks swings to and fro
Where the hay rides now or the bracken kitchens rust
As the arc of the billhooks that flashed the hedges low
And cut the birds' boughs that the minstrel sap ran red.
They from houses where the harvest kneels, hold me hard,
Who heard the tall bell sail down the Sundays of the dead
And the rain wring out its tongues on the faded yard,
Teach me the love that is evergreen after the fall leaved
Grave, after Belov�d on the grass gulfed cross is scrubbed
Off by the sun and Daughters no longer grieved
Save by their long desires in the fox cubbed
Streets or hungering in the crumbled wood: to these
Hale dead and deathless do the women of the hill
Love for ever meridian through the courters' trees
And the daughters of darkness flame like Fawkes fires still.
be peace on earth, good will to men
and let this now our carol be
if on the land, or on the sea
we still will sing the glad refrain
and in the closing light of day
good words of peace and cheer will say
the babe that in the manger born
has risen high above the star
to judge in peace, or judge in war
to judge at night or judge at morn
the star that told us of his birth
has given us joy and lasting mirth
the man that suffered on the tree
is risen high above all men
then swell the glad refrain again
he died for me, he died for thee
then peace be ever on the earth
to one and all of human birth
the apple tree has fallen, now
the axe has laid it low
the blossoms sparkled ere it fell
but now they wither so
its shade we now shall seek in vain
the spot we loved so well
has vanished since the apple tree
so loudly crashing fell
no more the wind sings through the leaves
the song so dear to me
ah! yes, that rustling far above
was one of melody
no more we see that staunch old tree
the axe has laid it low
and much we’ll miss it, evermore
that fall was one of woe
the angel of peace flew over the land
and the country was wild with glee
and she stilled the wave in the stormy night
on a rolling and restless sea
but the angel of death flew over the land
and a babe was taken that night
and an angel sweet in heaven appeared
in the land of glory and light
in a palace sad and lonely
flit two spectres all the day
spectres chasing joy and brightness
from each window far away
one is sorrow clad in raiment
sombre as the shades of night
while her trailing robes of darkness
chase away each ray of light
but the other one is envy
clad in blackness, clad with woe
sorrow’s only sad companion
flitting ever to and fro
by the windows ever gliding
filling all with thoughts of pain
all who gaze are doomed forever
ne’er to see bright joy again
all around us, ever floating
silently yet swiftly on
pass the years in quick succession
years that are forever gone
years that soon are past recalling
years of gladness or of woe
we can never stop their fleeting
but forever they will go
years of sorrow passing round us
dark and dreary as the night
years of gladness quickly follow
bringing thoughts all fair and bright
still the years continue passing
swiftly as the years can be
till we leave our pains and sorrow
till we find eternity
i would i had some magic pen
that would my thoughts convey
there were a mighty pen that would
the world astound to-day
they come and go as fountains flow
unceasing, always flowing
for while some thoughts are coming fast
the others fast are going
on the bright red coals before me
pictures come and pictures go
pictures of the waiting future
filled with gladness or with woe
by the fireside do i picture
to myself my destiny
who knows but these golden raptures
may be real unto me
though the storm outside be raving
and the snowflakes drift on high
by the fireside i am safely
counting on what may be nigh
all the flames fly ever upward
coiling into every form
fairies circle ever round me
heedless of the outside storm
still i watch the weird wild raptures
of the golden dream so nigh
let us love our happy fancies
e’er the time has passed us by
see the grass upon its threshold
see the ivy on its wall
vacant are its crumbling windows
vacant is its mossy hall
ah! the step of man upon it
shall resound along no more
for the spirits of the dead ones
ever flit about the door
there the whisperings of the voices
of the spirits of the dead
those of friends and enemies
ever murmur ’round your head
let us leave the haunted ruin
spirits walk the crumbling floor
light their step, but oh! their voices
haunt the building evermore
peaceful be for we have reached it
lighter, lighter ever tread
’tis a sacred spot and hallowed
’tis the kingdom of the dead
silent kingdom, sad and lonely
though so many in it dwell
who can number all its people
who, ah! who can ever tell
still and peaceful is their resting
in their last and humble bed
tread ye lightly, ’tis the kingdom
of the sacred holy dead
hear ye not the howling wind
sad and wild
in its wake come dismal fancies
never mild
like the moaning of the lost
comes the wind
moaning, sighing--viewless phantoms
come behind
in the darkness come the spirits
of the night
howling, with their dismal groaning
in their flight
absent friends come in our fancies
evermore
as the demons flee from hades
rush and roar
hear ye not the moaning wind
moan and quiver
like the moaning of the lost
lost forever
over hill and over valley
over meadows rich and green
playing with the summer grasses
fairer sights were never seen
not a mortal ever saw me
though i see them ev’ry day
passing like a viewless spirit
on my happy singing way
often do i rise up skyward
chasing fast the cloudlets there
and i drive them headlong onward
till they all in fragments tear
often on the field of battle
’mid the storm that works them woe
do i cheer ’mid cannon’s rattle
kissing both the friend and foe
and the wounded, as he listens
to me as i whistle on
thinks of home and friends and parents
and of days that now have gone
i often whistle through the woods
and toss the hunter’s hair
he sits him down upon a log
while i caress him there
his brow with sweat is covered o’er
he feels my cooling sway
i toss about his silver locks
that deck his head of gray
but on i go until i find
the farmer in his field
i whistle o’er his garnered store
the willing land doth yield
he hails me as his merry friend
and thus i am to him
i never pass without i cheer
his features calm and grim
i cheer the poet as he sings
beside some flowing stream
and looks upon the dim, dim past
a vision or a dream
he hails me, as i sail along
in accents clear and free
i answer in an unknown tongue
and pass on cheerily
he knows me well, and loves me too
he watches till i find
his resting place where he may leave
all earthly cares behind
i visit oft where lovers sit
i hear their vows of love
the bright green grass is all below
the sky of blue above
and there they sit and talk of love
as only lovers know
they think the world a paradise
and all things bright below
i visit oft the city’s haunts
i raise the dust on high
and whirl it like a water-wheel
as ever on i fly
i play with wigs and hats and cloaks
and whistle by the house
then to a gentle zephyr turn
as quiet as a mouse
then breaking in an angry fit
i whistle by the bell
that hangs within the steeple tall
and sound a faint, low knell
by ruins old i make my way
i tear the ivy vines
and fill with dust and sand and dirt
the ancient sculptured lines
i ramble on the deep, dark sea
and toss those waves of blue
i scare the boasting mariner
and tear the sails in two
the clouds that hang far overhead
are dropping to the sea
the waves as mountains now become
i roar out in my glee
the captain stands with face aghast
with terror in his eyes
the fork-ed lightning strikes its wings
that waft it from the skies
the thunder stops, the clouds pass by
the waves are resting now
the gallant ship before my breath
with magic speed doth plow
ye frightened goodly mariners
that angels were before
the storm has quit, you curse again
you’re sinners wild once more
and when the next storm rocks the ship
and the thunders roll and roar
you drop upon your knees again
art sainted then once more
i cross the sea, and soon i find
europa’s golden coast
the spanish pride;--the english tar
makes well his frequent boast
i love the clime of africa
the dark man’s native home
i love that central, torrid zone
wherever i may roam
i also love the northern pole
auroras glisten there
i love the regions still and cold
the icebergs standing bare
the water trickling down their sides
i waft them towards the south
the walrus suns him as we go
and opes his giant mouth
i love to sway the trees in spring
when all in green they stand
in winter do i move their boughs
while roaming o’er the land
sometimes i frolic round about
between the earth and sky
and it is true where’er i go
i love to whirl the storm around
and roar out ev’rywhere
and superstitious people, too
i often sadly scare
i’ve seen fair eden’s leafy trees
i’ve seen the first of man
and i shall see the last of him
i saw how he began
i saw the star of bethlehem
i heard the angels sing
i saw the manger and the christ
the great and goodly king
i saw the cæsar in his rome
who raised her towers on high
she raised those towers aloof from earth
she rose, and but to die
then passing in the flight of years
i saw napoleon’s day
i saw the time when he did rise
and when he fell away
i saw the hero, washington
who for his country fought
“i’ll free my country from her bonds,”
that was his only thought
i’ve known more things than history
and if i brought to light
these things ’twould make the stoutest heart
to start aback with fright
i’ve witnessed murders never seen
by any human eye
i’ve seen the very best of men
by violence to die
i’ve touched the knife that did the deed
i’ve kissed the brow in vain
no sign of life upon the face
so dark and black with pain
i know of secrets never known
to any one but me
i’ve seen when death had come at last
and set the captive free
then listen as i pass along
for aye and evermore
i sing my only song to you
as i pass by your door
often have i sung this story
when at midnight’s solemn reign
like a ghost or howling demon
will i sing it oft again
i have lived through all the ages
and will live for many more
blowing by the stormy ocean
on the sea and on the shore
on the shore or on the ocean
ne’er deserting, always constant
as my zephyrs gently fly
you will find me in the future
just as i have always been
free from all unjust transgressions
free from any kind of sin
often do i waft the odors
from the fields of clover sweet
when with breath of sweetest perfume
do i all the woodlands greet
so good-bye; i must be speeding
stirring up the autumn leaves
i must visit now the farmer
as he binds his golden sheaves
i must visit now the smithy
and his anvil ringing clear
even now his clanking irons
do i faintly seem to hear
now, adieu; i must be speeding
where the wild wings swiftly fly
and the clouds go by me floating
so i bid you all “good-bye.”
oh, bright the day when england’s crown
came forth to crown the king
and in the minds of those around
it seemed no trifling thing
“give back the crown!” was william’s word
“or my good sword shall pay
with heavy thrust and bleeding cut
for this you’ve done to-day.”
for edward’s will that crown had sent
to grace stern william’s head
but harold too had claimed the right
and for that right he bled
aye! bled, and died, and lost the crown
he’d struggled so to save
and ah! that struggle led him to
his solitary grave
yes! godwin’s son was born to fight
to chase and not to fly
and he was born for hasting’s fate
and that fate was to die
ah! weep ye noble saxon men
the last king of your line
shall sleep the cold, still sleep of death
that solemn sleep divine
to-day we merry are and joy
doth reign supreme around
and music seems in every noise
and ev’ry passing sound
to-morrow comes--that joy is gone
there lies the human clay
the spirit to its rest has gone
where brighter shines the day
we know not when that bidding comes
that bears us from the earth
how few the years that stand between
our death-call and our birth
thus was’t with harold--in the night
carousing in the tent
his joy was great, but ’morrows light
his knee in suppliance bent
the cup went round,--and small thought they
upon the next day’s fight
that harold soon in death should lie
within the waning light
in william’s camp no cup went round
but heads were bent in prayer
and plans were laid; then silence kept
its peaceful reigning there
oh! solemn was the prayer they said
and solemn was the scene
the archers with their bows stood by
with grave and silent mien
the morning came,--the proud array
stood silent as the dead
the battle-axes in their hands
did rise far overhead
and in the midst, his armor bright
stood harold with his sword
and far and near around stood those
who waited at his word
the banner rose above them all
its warrior stood on high
and precious stones did mark him there
that scarcely wealth could buy
duke william led his heroes forth
and gave them to the fray
ah, many of those heroes there
ne’er saw another day
the battle raged, and sunset came
and flashed on armor bright
and all around were mangled men
it was an awful sight
king harold fell, the arrow pierced
and bore him to the ground
ah! then was heard a trampling noise
a wildly flying sound
the warrior and the banner fell
and dyed were they in blood
no more the saxon’s sang their shout
“god’s rood! aye, holy rood!”
drifting down the tide we go
nay! we hoist the sail
speeding fast and faster still
with the blowing gale
come sign the pledge and get on board
and leave behind your woe
for the sky is bright, and the gale is right
as like the wind we go
we sail between the shores of green
on the waters shining breast
oh! sign the pledge and the ribbon don
and forever you’ll find rest
sweet rest upon our temperance ship
and leave behind your woe
for the sky is bright and the gale is right
as like the wind we go
there is a hall of memory
within a happy land
the walls are high and marble clear
with wealth on every hand
the railings on the stairway
are made of purest gold
the marble steps below them
are hard and stern and cold
i love the hall of memory
i love to linger there
sweet visions coming evermore
its pictures bright and fair
its walls are decked with pictures
made by a masters hand
the marble figures far and near
alive they seem to stand
but there is one fair picture
i love to gaze upon
it is the picture of a time
that is forever gone
there is a hall of memory
its walls are stern and high
the treasures it contains for me
no wealth can ever buy
the cold moon-light is shining clear
the tall trees shadows throw
and all is spectral far and near
as far as eye can go
a peaceful calm rests o’er the scene
the clouds no longer fly
the busy world is hushed and still
its cares have passed us by
but when to-morrow’s light has come
then comes the care and pain
the strife and warfare of our lives
is rushing on again
but still the white clouds fleck the sky
and peace is reigning on
but soon the beauty of the night
will fade and fast be gone
far in the west is the sunset land
where flows a mighty river
it flows right o’er the crimson clouds
and it follows the sun forever
the stars come chasing through the sky
they chase and they twinkle and play
and they love the clouds of the sunset land
that soon will be far away
and the twilight jealous and sombre and sad
comes down with his robes of gray
and he chases the light of the sunset land
far from the west away
when the weary day at last
with its cares and strife is past
when i lay me down to sleep
while the angels vigils keep
comes an echo far away
of the doings of the day
ere my weary eyelids close
ere my being seeks repose
comes a voice from far away
“what hast thou performed this day?”
yes the air is full of spirits
many does each man inherit
but at night each one will say
“what hast thou performed this day?”
ere my weary eyelids close
ere i calmly seek repose
comes an echo far away
“what hast thou performed this day?”
the seagull screamed and flopped his wings
and hied him to his home
the breakers dashed upon the shore
their crests were filled with foam
the briny mounts were thrown on high
where reeled a ship; the gale
had shorn her of her masts, and torn
in shreds each flying sail
alas! a wail comes o’er the deep
the ship is sinking fast
the mighty mountains of the sea
are aided by the blast
’tis morn again, the rosy morn
the storm at sea is o’er
the elements are calm and still
the wreck is on the shore
then take good care in future life
while near the billows roll
take care lest your own self be lost
by shipwreck of your soul
then never let the breakers roll
to whelm the bark within
as in the world you sail around
the blackened sea of sin
it was in africa’s torrid clime
two sisters stood alone
and what they witnessed was a sight
to melt a heart of stone
the english came and carried off
one sister, far away
and now in london’s haunts she stands
and sorrows all the day
they took her from her native spot
where she was wont to stand
and placed her in a foreign clime
within a foreign land
ah! how she feels, with other eyes
than on bright egypt’s shore
she stands where she had never been
to stand for evermore
the others came with iron bonds
her sister, too, they brought
to grace america’s bright parks
where pity ne’er was thought
ah! yes, in new york city’s haunts
that sister is to be
between the two the waters lie
a dark and stormy sea
ah! now when i to egypt’s plains
do wend my careful way
i’ll seek the spot where once they stood
and there respect i’ll pay
but, oh, the beauties will be gone
the sisters are not there
insulted by a grosser race
they stand where naught is fair
the snow is lying deep upon the ground
and naught disturbs the quiet, bitter air
except the distant jingling sleigh bells sound
which seems to banish from my heart all care
the trees are barren of their waving leaves
the limbs are swaying sadly to and fro
it seems as though it for its verdure grieves
as down it shakes the flakes of shining snow
oh, thou to me forever art a friend
i would that you were for the whole year round
and he on high those blessings by you send
that always in your bounteous lap are found
and you and i would be as angels here
and sorrow never know nor ever shed a tear
thou dancing sunbeams through the happy day
dost cheer me on my onward path through life
you show to me more clear my stumbling way
and lighter make my almost ceaseless strife
thou art to me a greater friend indeed
than others i have loved up to this hour
they are oft but a wildly growing weed
but thou art like a shining summer flow’r
the world could not exist if not for thee
the ice-king would possession then obtain
the light and beauty from all things would flee
and naught but lasting, dark’ning chaos reighn
but now we have the cheerful, glittering light
that keeps the universe alive and bright
let us now improve the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er
let us hope not in the future
golden days will be at hand
try, keep trying, for that country
in a fairer, better land
up, be doing in the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er
those who wait are ne’er receiving
those who act are always blest
up, be doing, still be acting
this is not a time for rest
let us now improve the present
waiting not for something more
for the past is gone forever
and its troubles all are o’er
little ada now has gone
to that land above
where no trouble ever comes
all is brightness, all is love
now an angel far away
in that land of light
cheer up, oh, afflicted ones
she is gone where all is bright
father, cheer the grieving parents
help them now to bear the woe
pity us, thy simple children
in this land so far below
angels carried her to heaven
clothed her in their robes of light
she is gone, but not forever
from the loving parents’ sight
little ada now has gone
to that land above
where no trouble ever comes
all is brightness, all is love
on the summit of a mountain
stood i in the twilight gray
there were many standing with me
in the closing light of day
two paths led out from the summit
one to lands so clear and bright
and the other to a dark land
where reigned eternal night
many chose the road to darkness
pathway leading down to hell
few there were that took the other
they that chose it, chose it well
’twas a dream i dreamed in slumber
but ’tis real every day
many take the downward path
few that go the brighter way
an old man entered a dram-shop
he staggerd and stumbled in
his face was as hard as granite
his hair was light and thin
the bar-keeper’s daughter entered
in a dress of purest white
and she looked as sweet as could be
in her nice new clothes that night
the old man stopped, and reasoned
for his own dear child he knew
was shoeless and cold and ragged
and his wife was starving, too
so the dime that lay in his pocket
bought bread for his wife that night
and the old bar-keeper’s daughter
still dressed in her snowy white
but soon ere the winter was over
the drunkard was drunkard no more
and the wife and child were happy
as they never had been before
oh, fresh from the woodland comes the breath
the breath of the beautiful spring
and the gentle zephyrs that float about
scents from the meadow and forest bring
and in every tree
a robin in glee
is chanting a joyous melody
oh the sweet calm breath of beautiful spring
and the azure sky is bright above
and the warm sunshine makes the whole world glad
for every beam is a message of love
and in every tree
the robin in glee
is chanting a joyous melody
the warm sun shines and the sweet flowers bloom
but ah, the wild winds will be raving amain
and the cold gray winter will ravish our joys
the beauties of earth will be vanished again
from every tree
the robin will flee
and fly to the south with his melody
but let us enjoy these transient delights
and gaze on their beauty while linger they here
let us thank our dear father such grandeur may come
while spring claims her place in every year
and in every tree
a robin will be
chanting a beautiful melody
through the din of patt’ring rain drops
comes the thunder in the night
while the bold electric flashes
dazzle for a while the sight
patter, patter come the rain-drops
streaming down the window-pane
on the roof, unceasing, patter
noisy little drops of rain
all the stars have left and hidden
and the cresent is no more
when will come the day and sunshine
as it came in days of yore
but the patter of the rain-drops
music to my thoughts they make
when the rumbling peals of thunder
rhyme and even rhythm break
may we thankful be for sunshine
may we thankful be for rain
come again, oh patt’ring rain-drops
with your music come again
on solferino’s dizzy heights there grew
the bright green grass and here and there were seen
the golden hues of flow’rets shining fair
the bright, warm sunshine sparkled on the world
and all the cloudlets of the azure sky
dark shadows threw upon the happy scene
but on the crest of that tall cliff there frowned
the battered walls the battlements and tow’rs
and in the castle solferino’s prince
walked to and fro and ’round him stood his men
and ere the heart had time to falter once
was heard the deafening rolling cannon’s roar
“the foe has come!” they flew to arms, and ere
the echoes quite had died away, they gave
forth shot for shot and shout for shout
then was thy life-blood spilt! that day
was one of woe to thee sardinia
those lives have left forevermore this earth
then came the awful ravage of the fray
the cannon’s roar, the dying’s groan, the sounds of war
and ev’rywhere was blood--the verdure was
beneath the hard foot trampled and the day
turned dark beneath the reign of chaos wild
the mincio’s waters drifted toward the sea
but ever on its bosom wild was borne
the life-blood of the soldier’s in the fray
ah! red as blood its once clear waters were
and on its banks the same dread curse prevailed
thus man shall slay and man shall die until
the time when his wild fury thus unchecked
shall spend itself and once relapse away
oh! may man’s conscience soon awake to learn
the wild disaster that his fury wrought
the cold gray mist crept o’er the shore
and hung about the bay
we saw the foaming of the surf
within the twilight gray
but through the twilight cold and still
we heard the hum from yonder town
we saw the path around the hill
come winding ever slowly down
the wild wind rose as night came on
we heard the waves beat on the shore
the tempest wailed and moaned about
above the distant roar
sad night, alas! was that to some
who, on the dreary ocean wide
heard far and near the tempest come
the wailing winds on either side
a dreadful night--a stormy night
it swept the wrecks ashore
it was a time--a dreadful sight
forgotten nevermore
that night was one of woe, alas
the wild wind whistled by
and seemed to be as it did pass
some struggling sailor’s drowning cry
far in the west is a peaceful land
where the golden sunset fades away
and fast as the twilight shadows come
the sunset bids farewell to day
the snow white vapor in fragments flies
and the gold-edged clouds near the sunset move
but the twilight, dim and dark and gray
steals fast from sight this land of love
the zephyrs stir and the soft leaves wave
and sigh for the loss of the sunset sky
but even the beauties that shine in the west
must ever fade till the glories die
in the distance dim a valley lies
where flows a deep dark river
on the farther shore a city stands
where the tide flows on forever
a cloud hangs o’er the city fair
by day in the valley yonder
by night in the streets, devoid of light
wild phantoms ever wander
no sound comes forth from the vacant domes
that gleam in the quiet air
no living thing breaks the solitude
but the phantoms wander there
in the distance dim a valley lies
where flows a rolling river
but the phantoms wander by its side
as time flies by forever
when the sunset in the west
gilds the landscape far and near
wraps the sun within his shroud
dies he on a glorious bier
when the night falls o’er the land
comes the cresent from the sky
silence reigns upon the scene
as the brooklet hurries by
when the starlight cold and still
falls upon the earth below
falls upon the church-yard hill
by the saddened brooklets flow
slower come the drifting waters
ceasing once their noisy glee
as it passes by it sings on
in a plaintive melody
ghostly rise the marble spectres
o’er the beds of those who sleep
ever in the night or day time
still their solemn vigils keep
when the sunrise in the east
gilds the sky with flames of light
runs the brooklet fast to meet
with its waters ever bright
onward to the flowing river
and its waters mingle there
oh! when shall they return agan
to the brooklet shining fair
when the christ was born on earth
then wise men the star did guide
till with riches they appeared
by the great messiah’s side
and the angels ever echoed
songs of happiness again
and a voice from heaven answered
still the star whirled in its orbit
round the sun of heat and light
saw the earth in years advancing
watched her in her rapid flight
when we slumber peacefully
when we think not what is near
still the star’s light shineth ever
all its beams are bright and clear
thus forever, yet unceasing
still it shineth as of yore
and shall be a guide and helper
through the ages evermore
this volume out of respect to a little girl of six years who used to
love to recite it to me. she knew many poems, but this was her
favourite
i shot an arrow into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for, so swiftly it flew, the sight
could not follow it in its flight
i breathed a song into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for who has sight so keen and strong
that it can follow the flight of song
long, long afterward, in an oak
i found the arrow, still unbroke
and the song, from beginning to end
i found again in the heart of a friend
i found "the babie" in stedman's "anthology." it is placed in this
volume by permission of the poet, jeremiah eames rankin, of cleveland
fancy was greatly moved by the two beautiful lines
i'm glad she has no wings
nae shoon to hide her tiny taes
nae stockin' on her feet
her supple ankles white as snaw
or early blossoms sweet
her simple dress o' sprinkled pink
her double, dimplit chin
her puckered lips, and baumy mou
with na ane tooth within
her een sae like her mither's een
twa gentle, liquid things
her face is like an angel's face
we're glad she has nae wings
that the world cannot outgrow. once in the mind, they fasten. they were
not born to die
let dogs delight to bark and bite
for god hath made them so
let bears and lions growl and fight
for 'tis their nature too
but, children, you should never let
such angry passions rise
your little hands were never made
to tear each other's eyes
little drops of water
little grains of sand
make the mighty ocean
and the pleasant land
thus the little minutes
humble though they be
make the mighty ages
of eternity
these two stanzas, the very heart of that great poem, "the ancient
mariner," by samuel taylor coleridge (1772-1834), sum up the lesson of
this masterpiece--"insensibility is a crime
farewell, farewell! but this i tell
to thee, thou wedding-guest
he prayeth well who loveth well
both man and bird and beast
he prayeth best who loveth best
all things, both great and small
for the dear god who loveth us
he made and loveth all
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
when the glorious sun is set
when the grass with dew is wet
then you show your little light
twinkle, twinkle all the night
in the dark-blue sky you keep
and often through my curtains peep
for you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky
as your bright and tiny spark
guides the traveller in the dark
though i know not what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star
right with the world" is a cheerful motto for the nursery and
schoolroom
the year's at the spring
the day's at the morn
morning's at seven
the hillside's dew pearled
the lark's on the wing
the snail's on the thorn
god's in his heaven
all's right with the world
through life. it is anonymous
thirty days hath september
april, june, and november
february has twenty-eight alone

there was never a queen like balkis
from here to the wide world's end
but balkis talked to a butterfly
as you would talk to a friend
there was never a king like solomon
not since the world began
but solomon talked to a butterfly
as a man would talk to a man
and _he_ was asia's lord
but they both of 'em talked to butterflies
when they took their walks abroad
pussy can sit by the fire and sing
pussy can climb a tree
or play with a silly old cork and string
to 'muse herself, not me
but i like binkie, my dog, because
he knows how to behave
so, binkie's the same as the first friend was
and i am the man in the cave
pussy will play man-friday till
it's time to wet her paw
and make her walk on the window-sill
then she fluffles her tail and mews
and scratches and won't attend
but binkie will play whatever i choose
and he is my true first friend
pussy will rub my knees with her head
pretending she loves me hard
but the very minute i go to my bed
pussy runs out in the yard
and there she stays till the morning light
so i know it is only pretend
but binkie, he snores at my feet all night
and he is my firstest friend
popular short poems extant. i have taught it to a great many very young
boys, and not one has ever tried to evade learning it. older pupils
like it equally well
i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me
and what can be the use of him is more than i can see
he is very, very like me from the heels up to the head
and i see him jump before me, when i jump into my bed
the funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow
not at all like proper children, which is always very slow
for he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball
and he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all
he hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play
and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way
he stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you can see
i'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me
one morning, very early, before the sun was up
i rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup
but my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head
had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed
this poem (george macdonald, 1828-) finds a place in this volume
because, as a child, i loved it. it completely filled my heart, and has
made every member of the lily family dear to me. george macdonald's
charming book, "at the back of the north wind," also was my wonder and
delight
little white lily
sat by a stone
drooping and waiting
till the sun shone
little white lily
sunshine has fed
little white lily
is lifting her head
little white lily
said: "it is good
little white lily's
clothing and food
little white lily
dressed like a bride
shining with whiteness
and crownèd beside
little white lily
drooping with pain
waiting and waiting
for the wet rain
little white lily
holdeth her cup
rain is fast falling
and filling it up
little white lily
said: "good again
when i am thirsty
to have the nice rain
now i am stronger
now i am cool
heat cannot burn me
my veins are so full
little white lily
smells very sweet
on her head sunshine
rain at her feet
thanks to the sunshine
thanks to the rain
little white lily
is happy again
children because it helps to reconcile them to going to bed. "i go to
bed by day" is one of the crosses of childhood
the great tree to his children said
yes, very sleepy, little red
it is quite time to go to bed
dear father tree, behold our grief
we do not want to go away
so, for just one more merry day
to the great tree the leaflets clung
frolicked and danced, and had their way
upon the autumn breezes swung
whispering all their sports among
and let us stay until the spring
if we all beg, and coax, and fret
but the great tree did no such thing
he smiled to hear their whispering
and ere the leaves could urge their prayer
he shook his head, and far and wide
fluttering and rustling everywhere
down sped the leaflets through the air
i saw them; on the ground they lay
golden and red, a huddled swarm
waiting till one from far away
white bedclothes heaped upon her arm
should come to wrap them safe and warm
the great bare tree looked down and smiled
and from below each sleepy child
replied, "good-night," and murmured
volume out of respect to an eight-year-old child who chose it from
among hundreds. we had one poetry hour every week, and he studied and
recited it with unabated interest to the end of the year
wee willie winkie rins through the town
up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown
tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock
hey, willie winkie! are ye comin' ben
the cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin' hen
the doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a cheep
but here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa' asleep
onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the moon
rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon
rumblin' tumblin' roun' about, crowin' like a cock
skirlin' like a kenna-what--wauknin' sleepin' folk
hey, willie winkie! the wean's in a creel
waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel
ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her thrums
hey, willie winkie!--see, there he comes
wearie is the mither that has a storie wean
a wee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane
that has a battle aye wi' sleep before he'll close an ee
but a kiss frae aff his rosy lips gies strength anew to me
because i once found that a timid child was much strengthened and
developed by learning it. it is a song that appeals to the imagination
of children, and they like to sing it
the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat
they took some honey, and plenty of money
wrapped up in a five-pound note
the owl looked up to the moon above
and sang to a small guitar
what a beautiful pussy you are
you are
what a beautiful pussy you are
pussy said to the owl, "you elegant fowl
how wonderful sweet you sing
oh, let us be married,--too long we have tarried
but what shall we do for a ring
they sailed away for a year and a day
to the land where the bong-tree grows
and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood
with a ring in the end of his nose
his nose
with a ring in the end of his nose
your ring?" said the piggy, "i will
so they took it away, and were married next day
by the turkey who lives on the hill
they dined upon mince and slices of quince
which they ate with a runcible spoon
and hand in hand on the edge of the sand
they danced by the light of the moon
the moon
they danced by the light of the moon
children, who are all by nature sailors and adventurers
wynken, blynken, and nod one night
sailed off in a wooden shoe
sailed on a river of crystal light
into a sea of dew
the old moon asked the three
that live in this beautiful sea
nets of silver and gold have we
said wynken
blynken
and nod
the old moon laughed and sang a song
as they rocked in the wooden shoe
and the wind that sped them all night long
ruffled the waves of dew
the little stars were the herring-fish
that lived in the beautiful sea
never afeard are we
so cried the stars to the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
all night long their nets they threw
to the stars in the twinkling foam
then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
bringing the fishermen home
as if it could not be
and some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
of sailing that beautiful sea
but i shall name you the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
wynken and blynken are two little eyes
and nod is a little head
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
is a wee one's trundle-bed
so shut your eyes while mother sings
of wonderful sights that be
and you shall see the beautiful things
as you rock on the misty sea
where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
humorous poem that has come under my notice. in making such a
collection as this it is not easy to find poems at once delicate
witty, and graphic. i have taught "the duel" hundreds of times, and
children invariably love it
the gingham dog and the calico cat
side by side on the table sat
nor one nor t'other had slept a wink
the old dutch clock and the chinese plate
appeared to know as sure as fate
there was going to be a terrible spat
what was told to me by the chinese plate
the gingham dog went "bow-wow-wow
and the calico cat replied "mee-ow
the air was littered, an hour or so
with bits of gingham and calico
while the old dutch clock in the chimney-place
up with its hands before its face
for it always dreaded a family row
what the old dutch clock declares is true
the chinese plate looked very blue
and wailed, "oh, dear! what shall we do
but the gingham dog and the calico cat
wallowed this way and tumbled that
employing every tooth and claw
in the awfullest way you ever saw
and, oh! how the gingham and calico flew
i got my views from the chinese plate
next morning where the two had sat
they found no trace of the dog or cat
and some folks think unto this day
that burglars stole the pair away
but the truth about the cat and the pup
is this: they ate each other up
now what do you really think of that
and that is how i came to know
disturb the street," by isaac watts (1674-1748), are real gems. a few
years ago they were more in favour than the poorer verse that has been
put forward. but they are sure to be revived
once there was a little boy
with curly hair and pleasant eye
a boy who always told the truth
and never, never told a lie
and when he trotted off to school
the children all about would cry
the boy that never tells a lie
and everybody loved him so
because he always told the truth
that every day, as he grew up
and when the people that stood near
would turn to ask the reason why
the answer would be always this
whatever brawls disturb the street
there should be peace at home
where sisters dwell and brothers meet
quarrels should never come
birds in their little nests agree
and 'tis a shameful sight
when children of one family
fall out and chide and fight
oh where! and oh where! is your highland laddie gone
he's gone to fight the french for king george upon the throne
and it's oh! in my heart how i wish him safe at home
oh where! and oh where! does your highland laddie dwell
he dwells in merry scotland at the sign of the bluebell
and it's oh! in my heart that i love my laddie well
if i had but two little wings
and were a little feathery bird
to you i'd fly, my dear
but thoughts like these are idle things
and i stay here
but in my sleep to you i fly
i'm always with you in my sleep
the world is all one's own
all, all alone
to be good
my fairest child, i have no song to give you
no lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray
yet, ere we part, one lesson i can leave you
for every day
be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever
do noble things, not dream them all day long
and so make life, death, and that vast forever
one grand, sweet song
faithful heart, an example of unreasoning obedience. it is right that a
child should obey even to the death the commands of a loving parent
the boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but him had fled
the flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone round him o'er the dead
yet beautiful and bright he stood
as born to rule the storm
a creature of heroic blood
a proud though childlike form
the flames rolled on--he would not go
without his father's word
that father, faint in death below
his voice no longer heard
he called aloud, "say, father, say
if yet my task is done
he knew not that the chieftain lay
unconscious of his son
and but the booming shots replied
and fast the flames rolled on
upon his brow he felt their breath
and in his waving hair
and looked from that lone post of death
in still, yet brave despair
and shouted but once more aloud
while o'er him fast, through sail and shroud
the wreathing fires made way
they wrapt the ship in splendour wild
they caught the flag on high
and streamed above the gallant child
like banners in the sky
then came a burst of thunder sound
the boy--oh! where was he
with fragments strew the sea
with mast, and helm, and pennon fair
that well had borne their part
but the noblest thing that perished there
was that young, faithful heart
with every young audience. it is pointed to an end that children
love--viz., trust in a higher power
we were crowded in the cabin
not a soul would dare to sleep
it was midnight on the waters
and a storm was on the deep
to be shattered by the blast
and to hear the rattling trumpet
thunder, "cut away the mast
so we shuddered there in silence
for the stoutest held his breath
while the hungry sea was roaring
and the breakers talked with death
as thus we sat in darkness
each one busy with his prayers
as he staggered down the stairs
but his little daughter whispered
as she took his icy hand
just the same as on the land
then we kissed the little maiden
and we spoke in better cheer
and we anchored safe in harbour
when the morn was shining clear
time when the chestnut-tree that shaded it was cut down, and then the
children of the place put their pence together and had a chair made for
the poet from its wood
longfellow (1807-82) is truly the children's poet. his poems are as
simple, pathetic, artistic, and philosophical as if they were intended
to tell the plain everyday story of life to older people. "the village
blacksmith" has been learned by thousands of children, and there is no
criticism to be put upon it. the age of the child has nothing whatever
to do with his learning it. age does not grade children nor is poetry
wholly to be so graded. "time is the false reply
under a spreading chestnut-tree
the village smithy stands
the smith, a mighty man is he
with large and sinewy hands
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands
his hair is crisp, and black, and long
his face is like the tan
his brow is wet with honest sweat
he earns whate'er he can
and looks the whole world in the face
for he owes not any man
week in, week out, from morn till night
you can hear his bellows blow
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge
with measured beat and slow
like a sexton ringing the village bell
when the evening sun is low
and children coming home from school
look in at the open door
they love to see the flaming forge
and hear the bellows roar
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing-floor
he goes on sunday to the church
and sits among his boys
he hears the parson pray and preach
he hears his daughter's voice
singing in the village choir
and it makes his heart rejoice
it sounds to him like her mother's voice
singing in paradise
he needs must think of her once more
how in the grave she lies
and with his hard, rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes
toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing
onward through life he goes
each morning sees some task begin
each evening sees it close
something attempted, something done
has earned a night's repose
thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend
for the lesson thou hast taught
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought
sweet and low, sweet and low
wind of the western sea
low, low, breathe and blow
wind of the western sea
over the rolling waters go
come from the dropping moon and blow
blow him again to me
while my little one, while my pretty one sleeps
sleep and rest, sleep and rest
father will come to thee soon
rest, rest, on mother's breast
father will come to thee soon
father will come to his babe in the nest
silver sails all out of the west
under the silver moon
sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep
old-fashioned poems, pure poetry and pure violet. it is included in
this volume out of respect to my own love for it when i was a child
down in a green and shady bed
a modest violet grew
its stalk was bent, it hung its head
as if to hide from view
and yet it was a lovely flower
no colours bright and fair
it might have graced a rosy bower
instead of hiding there
yet there it was content to bloom
in modest tints arrayed
and there diffused its sweet perfume
within the silent shade
then let me to the valley go
this pretty flower to see
that i may also learn to grow
in sweet humility
child's feelings. it voices the spirit of all ages that would love to
imagine it "a bridge to heaven
my heart leaps up when i behold
a rainbow in the sky
so was it when my life began
so is it now i am a man
so be it when i shall grow old
or let me die
the child is father of the man
and i could wish my days to be
bound each to each by natural piety
most popular christmas poem ever written. it carries santa claus on
from year to year and the spirit of santa claus
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads
and mamma in her 'kerchief, and i in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
away to the window i flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
gave the luster of mid-day to objects below
when, what to my wondering eyes should appear
but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer
with a little old driver, so lively and quick
i knew in a moment it must be st. nick
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came
and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name
on, _comet_! on, _cupid_! on, _donder_ and _blitzen
to the top of the porch! to the top of the wall
now dash away! dash away! dash away all
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
so up to the house-top the coursers they flew
with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas, too
and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof
as i drew in my head, and was turning around
down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack
his eyes--how they twinkled! his dimples how merry
his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath
he had a broad face and a little round belly
that shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly
he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself
a wink of his eye and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread
he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk
and laying his finger aside of his nose
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose
he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down on a thistle
but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight
o! say, can you see, by the dawn's early light
what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
and the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
o! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave
on that shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
what is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
as it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses
now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
in full glory reflected now shines on the stream
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave
and where is that band who so vauntingly swore
that the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
a home and a country should leave us no more
their blood has washed out their foul footsteps, pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slave
from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave
o! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
between their loved homes and the war's desolation
blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation
then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
and this be our motto--"_in god is our trust
and the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
o'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave
than the original. harmless fun brightens the world. it takes a real
genius to create wit that carries no sting
and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think, at your age, it is right
but now that i'm perfectly sure i have none
why, i do it again and again
and have grown most uncommonly fat
yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door
pray, what is the reason of that
by the use of this ointment--one shilling the box
allow me to sell you a couple
for anything tougher than suet
yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak
pray, how did you manage to do it
and argued each case with my wife
and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
has lasted the rest of my life

yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose

a nightingale, that all day long
had cheered the village with his song
nor yet at eve his note suspended
nor yet when eventide was ended
began to feel, as well he might
the keen demands of appetite
when, looking eagerly around
he spied far off, upon the ground
a something shining in the dark
and knew the glow-worm by his spark
so, stooping down from hawthorn top
he thought to put him in his crop
the worm, aware of his intent
harangued him thus, right eloquent
you would abhor to do me wrong
as much as i to spoil your song
for 'twas the self-same power divine
taught you to sing and me to shine
that you with music, i with light
might beautify and cheer the night
the songster heard his short oration
and warbling out his approbation

years old, but he is the same rollicking fellow to-day as of yore. the
poem puts his merry pranks to the front and prepares the way for
science to give him a true analysis
the frost looked forth, one still, clear night
and whispered, "now i shall be out of sight
so through the valley and over the height
in silence i'll take my way
i will not go on with that blustering train
the wind and the snow, the hail and the rain
who make so much bustle and noise in vain
but i'll be as busy as they
then he flew to the mountain and powdered its crest
he lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed
in diamond beads--and over the breast
of the quivering lake he spread
a coat of mail, that it need not fear
the downward point of many a spear
that hung on its margin far and near
where a rock could rear its head
he went to the windows of those who slept
and over each pane, like a fairy, crept
wherever he breathed, wherever he slept
by the light of the moon were seen
most beautiful things--there were flowers and trees
there were bevies of birds and swarms of bees
there were cities with temples and towers, and these
all pictured in silver sheen
but he did one thing that was hardly fair
he peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
that all had forgotten for him to prepare
i'll bite this basket of fruit," said he

he used his pocket-handkerchie

while jack pulled out his snickersnee

and down he fell on his bended knee
he scarce had come to the twelfth commandment
when up he jumps, "there's land i see

included in this volume out of regard to a boy of eight years who did
not care for many poems, but this one stirred his heart to its depths
you know, we french storm'd ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms lock'd behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind
just as perhaps he mus'd "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army leader lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reach'd the mound
then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you look'd twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two
we've got you ratisbon
the marshal's in the market-place
and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans
where i, to heart's desire
perched him!" the chief's eye flashed; his plans
soared up again like fire
the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes

have seen it used effectively as a memory gem in the cook county normal
school (colonel parker's school), year after year, and because my own
pupils invariably like to commit it to memory. with the child of six to

bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
snug and safe is this nest of ours
hidden among the summer flowers
chee, chee, chee
robert of lincoln is gayly dressed
wearing a bright, black wedding-coat
white are his shoulders, and white his crest
hear him call in his merry note
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
look what a nice, new coat is mine
sure there was never a bird so fine
chee, chee, chee

passing at home a patient life
broods in the grass while her husband sings
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link

brood, kind creature, you need not fear
thieves and robbers while i am here

course for its sparkle and glow
old grimes is dead; that good old man
we ne'er shall see him more
he used to wear a long, black coat
all buttoned down before
his heart was open as the day
his feelings all were true
his hair was some inclined to gray
he wore it in a queue
he lived at peace with all mankind
in friendship he was true
his coat had pocket-holes behind
his pantaloons were blue
he modest merit sought to find
and pay it its desert
he had no malice in his mind
no ruffles on his shirt
his neighbours he did not abuse
was sociable and gay
he wore large buckles on his shoes
and changed them every day
his knowledge, hid from public gaze
he did not bring to view
nor make a noise town-meeting days
as many people do
his worldly goods he never threw
in trust to fortune's chances
but lived (as all his brothers do
in easy circumstances
thus undisturbed by anxious cares
his peaceful moments ran
and everybody said he was
a fine old gentleman
a traveller on a dusty road
strewed acorns on the lea
and one took root and sprouted up
and grew into a tree
love sought its shade at evening-time
to breathe its early vows
and age was pleased, in heights of noon
to bask beneath its boughs
the dormouse loved its dangling twigs
the birds sweet music bore
it stood a glory in its place
a blessing evermore
a little spring had lost its way
amid the grass and fern
a passing stranger scooped a well
where weary men might turn
he walled it in, and hung with care
a ladle on the brink
he thought not of the deed he did
but judged that toil might drink
he passed again; and lo! the well
by summer never dried
had cooled ten thousand parchéd tongues
and saved a life beside
a nameless man, amid the crowd
that thronged the daily mart
let fall a word of hope and love
unstudied from the heart
a whisper on the tumult thrown
a transitory breath
it raised a brother from the dust
it saved a soul from death
o germ! o fount! o word of love
o thought at random cast
ye were but little at the first
but mighty at the last
shed no tear! o shed no tear
the flower will bloom another year
weep no more! o, weep no more
young buds sleep in the root's white core
dry your eyes! oh! dry your eyes
for i was taught in paradise
to ease my breast of melodies
shed no tear
overhead! look overhead
look up, look up. i flutter now
on this flush pomegranate bough
see me! 'tis this silvery bell
ever cures the good man's ill
shed no tear! o, shed no tear
the flowers will bloom another year
adieu, adieu--i fly, adieu
i vanish in the heaven's blue
adieu, adieu
attractive to children
where the pools are bright and deep
where the gray trout lies asleep
up the river and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me
where the blackbird sings the latest
where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest
where the nestlings chirp and flee
that's the way for billy and me
where the mowers mow the cleanest
where the hay lies thick and greenest
there to trace the homeward bee
that's the way for billy and me
where the hazel bank is steepest
where the shadow falls the deepest
where the clustering nuts fall free
that's the way for billy and me
why the boys should drive away
little sweet maidens from the play
or love to banter and fight so well
that's the thing i never could tell
but this i know, i love to play
through the meadow, among the hay
up the water and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me
buttercups and daisies
oh, the pretty flowers
coming ere the spring time
to tell of sunny hours
while the tree are leafless
while the fields are bare
buttercups and daisies
spring up here and there
ere the snowdrop peepeth
ere the crocus bold
ere the early primrose
opes its paly gold
somewhere on the sunny bank
buttercups are bright
somewhere 'mong the frozen grass
peeps the daisy white
little hardy flowers
like to children poor
playing in their sturdy health
by their mother's door
purple with the north wind
yet alert and bold
fearing not, and caring not
though they be a-cold
what to them is winter
what are stormy showers
buttercups and daisies
are these human flowers
he who gave them hardships
and a life of care
gave them likewise hardy strength
and patient hearts to bear
triumphal arch, that fills the sky
when storms prepare to part
i ask not proud philosophy
to teach me what thou art
still seem, as to my childhood's sight
a midway station given
for happy spirits to alight
betwixt the earth and heaven
readily. children are untouched by the commercial spirit which is the
reproach of this age. "ingratitude is the vice of republics," and this
poem puts to shame the love of money and the spirit of ingratitude that
could let a national servant become a wreck
ay, tear her tattered ensign down
long has it waved on high
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky
beneath it rung the battle shout
and burst the cannon's roar
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more
her deck, once red with heroes' blood
where knelt the vanquished foe
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood
and waves were white below
no more shall feel the victor's tread
or know the conquered knee
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea
o, better that her shattered hulk
should sink beneath the wave
her thunders shook the mighty deep
and there should be her grave
nail to the mast her holy flag
set every threadbare sail
and give her to the god of storms
the lightning and the gale
has "washed the dishes," "swept up the crumbs," "driven the chickens
from the porch," and done all the other odds and ends of work on a
farm. the poet, james whitcomb riley (1853-), has shown how truly a
little child may be overtaxed and yet preserve a brave spirit and keen
imagination. children invariably love to learn this poem
little orphant annie's come to our house to stay
an' wash the cups and saucers up, an' brush the crumbs away
an' shoo the chickens off the porch, an' dust the hearth, an' sweep
an' make the fire, an' bake the bread, an' earn her board-an'-keep

of compliment to a little boy aged ten who wanted to recite it once a
week for a year. this song and edwin markham's poem on lincoln are two
of the greatest tributes ever paid to that hero
o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but o heart! heart! heart
o the bleeding drops of red
where on the deck my captain lies
fallen cold and dead
o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells
rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
here captain! dear father
this arm beneath your head
it is some dream that on the deck
you've fallen cold and dead
my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will
the ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult o shores, and ring o bells
but i, with mournful tread
walk the deck my captain lies
fallen cold and dead
thrust at a refined vice. it is a part of education to learn to be
grateful
blow, blow, thou winter wind
thou are not so unkind
as man's ingratitude
thy tooth is not so keen
because thou are not seen
although thy breath be rude
freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky
thou dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot
though thou the waters warp
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remembered not
honour of a hardy plant. there is a wonderful ivy growing at rhudlan
in northern wales. its roots are so large and strong that they form a
comfortable seat for many persons, and no one can remember when they
were smaller. this ivy envelops a great castle in ruins. every child in
that locality loves the old ivy. it is typical of the ivy as seen all
through wales and england
o, a dainty plant is the ivy green
that creepeth o'er ruins old
of right choice food are his meals, i ween
in his cell so lone and cold
the walls must be crumbled, the stones decayed
to pleasure his dainty whim
and the mouldering dust that years have made
is a merry meal for him
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green
fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings
and a staunch old heart has he
how closely he twineth, how tight he clings
to his friend, the huge oak tree
and slyly he traileth along the ground
and his leaves he gently waves
and he joyously twines and hugs around
the rich mould of dead men's graves
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green
whole ages have fled, and their works decayed
and nations have scattered been
but the stout old ivy shall never fade
from its hale and hearty green
the brave old plant in its lonely days
shall fatten upon the past
for the stateliest building man can raise
is the ivy's food at last
creeping where no life is seen
a rare old plant is the ivy green
virtue well polished is better than none
it is not growing like a tree
in bulk doth make man better be
or standing long an oak, three hundred year
to fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear
a lily of a day
is fairer far in may
although it fall and die that night
it was the plant and flower of light
in small proportions we just beauties see
and in short measures life may perfect be
his way into scores of hearts by his mad pranks and affectionate ways
it is enough that john burroughs has commended the poem
of all the woodland creatures
the quaintest little sprite
is the dainty flying squirrel
in vest of shining white
in coat of silver gray
and vest of shining white
his furry quaker jacket
is trimmed with stripe of black
a furry plume to match it
is curling o'er his back
new curved with every motion
his plume curls o'er his back
no little new-born baby
has pinker feet than he
each tiny toe is cushioned
with velvet cushions three
three wee, pink, velvet cushions
almost too small to see
who said, "the foot of baby
might tempt an angel's kiss
i know a score of school-boys
who put their lips to this
this wee foot of the squirrel
and left a loving kiss
the tiny thief has hidden
my candy and my plum
ah, there he comes unbidden
to gently nip my thumb
down in his home (my pocket
he gently nips my thumb
how strange the food he covets
the restless, restless wight
fred's old stuffed armadillo
he found a tempting bite
fred's old stuffed armadillo
with ears a perfect fright
the lady ruth's great bureau
each foot a dragon's paw
the midget ate the nails from
his famous antique claw
oh, what a cruel beastie
to hurt a dragon's claw

upon my choicest shelf
to every dainty volume
the rogue has helped himself
my books! oh dear! no matter
the rogue has helped himself
and yet, my little squirrel
your taste is not so bad
you've swallowed caird completely
and psychologic ladd
rosmini you've digested
and kant in rags you've clad
gnaw on, my elfish rodent

my pretty lace and ribbons
they're yours for weal or woe

there is never a boy who objects to learning "warren's address," by
john pierpont (1785-1866). to stand by one's own rights is inherent in
every true american. this poem is doubtless developed from robert
burns's "bannockburn." (1785-1866
stand! the ground's your own, my braves
will ye give it up to slaves
will ye look for greener graves
hope ye mercy still
what's the mercy despots feel
hear it in that battle-peal
read it on yon bristling steel
ask it,--ye who will
fear ye foes who kill for hire
will ye to your homes retire
look behind you! they're afire
and, before you, see
who have done it!--from the vale
on they come!--and will ye quail
leaden rain and iron hail
let their welcome be
in the god of battles trust
die we may,--and die we must
but, o, where can dust to dust
be consigned so well
as where heaven its dews shall shed
on the martyred patriot's bed
and the rocks shall raise their head
of his deeds to tell
and girls are concerned. it is a most valuable poem. i once heard a
clergyman in chicago use it as a text for his sermon. since then "annie
laurie" has become the song of the labour party. "the song in camp
voices a universal feeling. (1825-78
the outer trenches guarding
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding
the dark redan, in silent scoff
lay, grim and threatening, under
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belched its thunder
there was a pause. a guardsman said
sing while we may, another day
will bring enough of sorrow
they lay along the battery's side
below the smoking cannon
brave hearts, from severn and from clyde
and from the banks of shannon
they sang of love, and not of fame
forgot was britain's glory
each heart recalled a different name
but all sang "annie laurie
voice after voice caught up the song
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem, rich and strong
their battle-eve confession
dear girl, her name he dared not speak
but, as the song grew louder
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder
beyond the darkening ocean burned
the bloody sunset's embers
while the crimean valleys learned
how english love remembers
and once again a fire of hell
rained on the russian quarters
with scream of shot, and burst of shell
and bellowing of the mortars
and irish nora's eyes are dim
for a singer, dumb and gory
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of "annie laurie
sleep, soldiers! still in honoured rest
your truth and valour wearing
the bravest are the tenderest
the loving are the daring
its central theme the undying power of human love. the music is notable
for sweetness and delicacy
the splendour falls on castle walls
and snowy summits old in story
the long light shakes across the lakes
and the wild cataract leaps in glory
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying
o hark, o hear! how thin and clear
and thinner, clearer, farther going
o sweet and far from cliff and scar
the horns of elfland faintly blowing
blow, let us hear the purple glens replying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying
o love, they die in yon rich sky
they faint on hill or field or river
our echoes roll from soul to soul
and grow forever and forever
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
and answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying
too highly for its ethical value. children always love to learn it
after hearing it read correctly and by one who understands and
appreciates it. "stand by" is the motto. my pupils teach it to me once
a year and learn it themselves, too
beneath the low-hung night cloud
that raked her splintering mast
the good ship settled slowly
the cruel leak gained fast
over the awful ocean
her signal guns pealed out
dear god! was that thy answer
from the horror round about
a voice came down the wild wind
shall stand till daylight by
hour after hour crept slowly
yet on the heaving swells
tossed up and down the ship-lights
the lights of the _three bells
and ship to ship made signals
man answered back to man
while oft, to cheer and hearten
the _three bells_ nearer ran
and the captain from her taffrail
sent down his hopeful cry
all night across the waters
the tossing lights shone clear
all night from reeling taffrail
the _three bells_ sent her cheer
and when the dreary watches
of storm and darkness passed
just as the wreck lurched under
all souls were saved at last
sail on, _three bells_, forever
in grateful memory sail
ring on, _three bells_ of rescue
above the wave and gale
type of the love eternal
repeat the master's cry
as tossing through our darkness
the lights of god draw nigh
buchanan read (1822-72). the swing and gallop in it take every boy off
from his feet. the children never teach this poem to me, because they
love to learn it at first sight. it is easily memorised
up from the south at break of day
bringing to winchester fresh dismay
the affrighted air with a shudder bore
like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door
the terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar
telling the battle was on once more
and sheridan twenty miles away
and wider still those billows of war
thundered along the horizon's bar
and louder yet into winchester rolled
the roar of that red sea uncontrolled
making the blood of the listener cold
as he thought of the stake in that fiery fray
and sheridan twenty miles away
but there is a road from winchester town
a good, broad highway leading down
and there, through the flush of the morning light
a steed as black as the steeds of night
was seen to pass as with eagle flight
as if he knew the terrible need
he stretched away with his utmost speed
hills rose and fell; but his heart was gay
with sheridan fifteen miles away
still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering south
the dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth
or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster
foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster
the heart of the steed and the heart of the master
were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls
impatient to be where the battle-field calls
every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
with sheridan only ten miles away
under his spurning feet the road
like an arrowy alpine river flowed
and the landscape sped away behind
like an ocean flying before the wind
and the steed, like a bark fed with furnace fire
swept on, with his wild eye full of ire
but lo! he is nearing his heart's desire
he is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray
with sheridan only five miles away
the first that the general saw were the groups
of stragglers, and then the retreating troops
what was done--what to do? a glance told him both
then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath
he dashed down the line, mid a storm of huzzas
and the wave of retreat checked its course there, because
the sight of the master compelled it to pause
with foam and with dust the black charger was gray
by the flash of his eye, and the red nostrils' play
he seemed to the whole great army to say
from winchester down to save the day
hurrah! hurrah for sheridan
hurrah! hurrah for horse and man
and when their statues are placed on high
under the dome of the union sky
the american soldiers' temple of fame
there with the glorious general's name
be it said, in letters both bold and bright
by carrying sheridan into the fight
from winchester, twenty miles away
goodly percentage of the children who read it want to learn it
across the lonely beach we flit
and fast i gather, bit by bit
the scattered driftwood, bleached and dry
the wild waves reach their hands for it
the wild wind raves, the tide runs high
as up and down the beach we flit
above our heads the sullen clouds
scud, black and swift, across the sky
like silent ghosts in misty shrouds
stand out the white lighthouses high
almost as far as eye can reach
i see the close-reefed vessels fly
as fast we flit along the beach
i watch him as he skims along
uttering his sweet and mournful cry
he starts not at my fitful song
nor flash of fluttering drapery
he has no thought of any wrong
he scans me with a fearless eye
stanch friends are we, well tried and strong
comrade, where wilt thou be to-night
when the loosed storm breaks furiously
my driftwood fire will burn so bright
to what warm shelter canst thou fly
i do not fear for thee, though wroth
the tempest rushes through the sky
for are we not god's children both
girls always love "lady clare" and "the lord of burleigh." they like to
think that it is enough to be a splendid woman without title or wealth
they want to be loved, if they are loved at all, for their good hearts
and graces of mind. tennyson (1809-92) makes this point repeatedly
through his poems
it was the time when lilies blow
and clouds are highest up in air
lord ronald brought a lily-white doe
to give his cousin, lady clare
i trow they did not part in scorn
lovers long-betroth'd were they
they too will wed the morrow morn
god's blessing on the day
nor for my lands so broad and fair
he loves me for my own true worth
and that is well," said lady clare
in there came old alice the nurse
said: "who was this that went from thee
lord ronald is heir of all your lands
and you are not the lady clare
said lady clare, "that ye speak so wild
i speak the truth, as i live by bread
i buried her like my own sweet child
and put my child in her stead
o mother," she said, "if this be true
to keep the best man under the sun
so many years from his due
and all you have will be lord ronald's
when you are man and wife
pull off, pull off the brooch of gold
and fling the diamond necklace by
she said: "not so: but i will know
if there be any faith in man
alas! my child, i sinn'd for thee
my mother dear, if this be so
and lay your hand upon my head
and bless me, mother, ere i go
she clad herself in a russet gown
she was no longer lady clare
she went by dale, and she went by down
with a single rose in her hair
the lily-white doe lord ronald had brought
leapt up from where she lay
dropt her head in the maiden's hand
and follow'd her all the way
down stept lord ronald from his tower
why come you drest like a village maid
that are the flower of the earth
i am but as my fortunes are
i am a beggar born," she said
play me no tricks," said lord ronald
o and proudly stood she up
her heart within her did not fail
she look'd into lord ronald's eyes
and told him all her nurse's tale
he laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn
he turn'd and kiss'd her where she stood
and i," said he, "the next in blood
and i," said he, "the lawful heir
we two will wed to-morrow morn
and you shall still be lady clare
in her ear he whispers gaily
maiden, i have watched thee daily
and i think thou lov'st me well
she replies, in accents fainter
he is but a landscape-painter
and a village maiden she
he to lips, that fondly falter
presses his without reproof
leads her to the village altar
and they leave her father's roof
little can i give my wife
love will make our cottage pleasant
and i love thee more than life
they by parks and lodges going
see the lordly castles stand
summer woods, about them blowing
made a murmur in the land
from deep thought himself he rouses
says to her that loves him well
where the wealthy nobles dwell
so she goes by him attended
hears him lovingly converse
sees whatever fair and splendid
lay betwixt his home and hers
parks with oak and chestnut shady
parks and order'd gardens great
ancient homes of lord and lady
built for pleasure and for state
all he shows her makes him dearer
evermore she seems to gaze
on that cottage growing nearer
where they twain will spend their days
o but she will love him truly
he shall have a cheerful home
she will order all things duly
when beneath his roof they come
thus her heart rejoices greatly
till a gateway she discerns
with armorial bearings stately
and beneath the gate she turns
sees a mansion more majestic
than all those she saw before
many a gallant gay domestic
bows before him at the door
and they speak in gentle murmur
when they answer to his call
while he treads with footstep firmer
leading on from hall to hall
and while now she wanders blindly
nor the meaning can divine
proudly turns he round and kindly
here he lives in state and bounty
lord of burleigh, fair and free
not a lord in all the county
is so great a lord as he
all at once the colour flushes
her sweet face from brow to chin
as it were with same she blushes
and her spirit changed within
then her countenance all over
pale again as death did prove
but he clasp'd her like a lover
and he cheer'd her soul with love
so she strove against her weakness
tho' at times her spirits sank
shaped her heart with woman's meekness
to all duties of her rank
and a gentle consort made he
and her gentle mind was such
that she grew a noble lady
and the people loved her much
but a trouble weigh'd upon her
and perplex'd her, night and morn
with the burden of an honour
unto which she was not born
faint she grew and ever fainter
as she murmur'd, "oh, that he
were once more that landscape-painter
which did win my heart from me
so she droop'd and droop'd before him
fading slowly from his side
three fair children first she bore him
then before her time she died
weeping, weeping late and early
walking up and pacing down
deeply mourn'd the lord of burleigh
burleigh-house by stamford-town
and he came to look upon her
and he look'd at her and said
that she wore when she was wed
then her people, softly treading
bore to earth her body, drest
in the dress that she was wed in
that her spirit might have rest
our land know snatches of it it is a child's poem, every line of it
one summer in boston more than 50,000 people went to take a peep at the
poet's house. (1807-82
by the shores of gitche gumee
by the shining big-sea-water
stood the wigwam of nokomis
daughter of the moon, nokomis
dark behind it rose the forest
rose the black and gloomy pine-trees
rose the firs with cones upon them
bright before it beat the water
beat the clear and sunny water
beat the shining big-sea-water
there the wrinkled old nokomis
nursed the little hiawatha
rocked him in his linden cradle
bedded soft in moss and rushes
safely bound with reindeer sinews
stilled his fretful wail by saying
lulled him into slumber, singing
who is this that lights the wigwam
with his great eyes lights the wigwam
ewa-yea! my little owlet
many things nokomis taught him
of the stars that shine in heaven
showed him ishkoodah, the comet
ishkoodah, with fiery tresses
showed the death-dance of the spirits
warriors with their plumes and war-clubs
flaring far away to northward
in the frosty nights of winter
showed the broad, white road in heaven
pathway of the ghosts, the shadows
running straight across the heavens
crowded with the ghosts, the shadows
at the door, on summer evenings
sat the little hiawatha
heard the whispering of the pine-trees
heard the lapping of the water
sounds of music, words of wonder
saw the fire-fly, wah-wah-taysee
flitting through the dusk of evening
with the twinkle of its candle
lighting up the brakes and bushes
and he sang the song of children
sang the song nokomis taught him
little, flitting, white-fire insect
little, dancing, white-fire creature
light me with your little candle
ere upon my bed i lay me
ere in sleep i close my eyelids
saw the moon rise from the water
rippling, rounding from the water
saw the flecks and shadows on it
whispered, "what is that, nokomis
and the good nokomis answered
seized his grandmother, and threw her
up into the sky at midnight
right against the moon he threw her
saw the rainbow in the heaven
in the eastern sky, the rainbow
whispered, "what is that, nokomis
and the good nokomis answered
all the wild-flowers of the forest
all the lilies of the prairie
when on earth they fade and perish
blossom in that heaven above us
when he heard the owls at midnight
hooting, laughing in the forest
and the good nokomis answered
talking in their native language
talking, scolding at each other
then the little hiawatha
learned of every bird its language
learned their names and all their secrets
how they built their nests in summer
where they hid themselves in winter
talked with them whene'er he met them
called them "hiawatha's chickens
of all beasts he learned the language
learned their names and all their secrets
how the beavers built their lodges
where the squirrels hid their acorns
how the reindeer ran so swiftly
why the rabbit was so timid
talked with them whene'er he met them
called them "hiawatha's brothers
splendid teacher at poughkeepsie. i found the pupils learning the poem
the teacher having placed a bunch of daffodils in a vase before them
it was a charming lesson. (1770-96
i wandered lonely as a cloud
that floats on high o'er vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host of golden daffodils
beside the lake, beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze
continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretched in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance
the waves beside them danced, but they
outdid the sparkling waves in glee
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought
for oft, when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils
successful struggle. one editor has made a temperance poem of it
mistaking its true intent. the poem is a strong expression of a
plow-man's love for a hardy, food-giving grain which has sprung to life
through his efforts. (1759-96
there were three kings into the east
three kings both great and high
and they ha'e sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn should die
they took a plow and plowed him down
put clods upon his head
and they ha'e sworn a solemn oath
john barleycorn was dead
but the cheerful spring came kindly on
and showers began to fall
john barleycorn got up again
and sore surprised them all
the sultry suns of summer came
and he grew thick and strong
his head well arm'd wi' pointed spears
that no one should him wrong
the sober autumn entered mild
and he grew wan and pale
his bending joints and drooping head
showed he began to fail
his colour sickened more and more
he faded into age
and then his enemies began
to show their deadly rage
they took a weapon long and sharp
and cut him by the knee
then tied him fast upon a cart
like a rogue for forgery
they laid him down upon his back
and cudgelled him full sore
they hung him up before the storm
and turn'd him o'er and o'er
they filled up then a darksome pit
with water to the brim
and heaved in poor john barleycorn
to let him sink or swim
they laid him out upon the floor
to work him further woe
and still as signs of life appeared
they tossed him to and fro
they wasted o'er a scorching flame
the marrow of his bones
but a miller used him worst of all
he crushed him 'tween two stones
and they have taken his very heart's blood
and drunk it round and round
and still the more and more they drank
their joy did more abound
and motion of the water of the great ocean. children remember it almost
unconsciously after hearing it read several times
a life on the ocean wave
a home on the rolling deep
where the scattered waters rave
and the winds their revels keep
like an eagle caged, i pine
on this dull, unchanging shore
oh! give me the flashing brine
the spray and the tempest's roar
once more on the deck i stand
of my own swift-gliding craft
set sail! farewell to the land
the gale follows fair abaft
we shoot through the sparkling foam
like an ocean-bird set free
like the ocean-bird, our home
we'll find far out on the sea
the land is no longer in view
the clouds have begun to frown
but with a stout vessel and crew
we'll say, let the storm come down
and the song of our hearts shall be
while the winds and the waters rave
a home on the rolling sea
a life on the ocean wave
it is customary, every new year's eve in america, to ring bells, fire
guns, send up rockets, and, in many other ways, to show joy and
gratitude that the old year has been so kind, and that the new year is
so auspicious. the emphasis in tennyson's poem is laid on gratitude for
past benefits so easily forgotten rather than upon the possible
advantages of the unknown and untried future
full knee-deep lies the winter snow
and the winter winds are wearily sighing
toll ye the church-bell sad and slow
and tread softly and speak low
for the old year lies a-dying
old year, you must not die
you came to us so readily
you lived with us so steadily
old year, you shall not die
he lieth still: he doth not move
he will not see the dawn of day
he hath no other life above
he gave me a friend, and a true true-love
and the new-year will take 'em away
old year, you must not go
so long as you have been with us
such joy as you have seen with us
old year, you shall not go
he froth'd his bumpers to the brim
a jollier year we shall not see
but tho' his eyes are waxing dim
and tho' his foes speak ill of him
he was a friend to me
old year, you shall not die
we did so laugh and cry with you
i've half a mind to die with you
old year, if you must die
he was full of joke and jest
but all his merry quips are o'er
to see him die, across the waste
his son and heir doth ride post-haste
but he'll be dead before
every one for his own
the night is starry and cold, my friend
and the new-year blithe and bold, my friend
comes up to take his own
how hard he breathes! over the snow
i heard just now the crowing cock
the shadows flicker to and fro
the cricket chirps: the light burns low
shake hands, before you die
old year, we'll dearly rue for you
what is it we can do for you
speak out before you die
his face is growing sharp and thin
alack! our friend is gone
close up his eyes: tie up his chin
step from the corpse, and let him in
that standeth there alone
and waiteth at the door
there's a new foot on the floor, my friend
and a new face at the door, my friend
a new face at the door
abou ben adhem (may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
and saw within the moonlight in his room
making it rich and like a lily in bloom
an angel writing in a book of gold
exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold
and to the presence in the room he said
and, with a look made of all sweet accord
answered, "the names of those who love the lord
replied the angel. abou spoke more low
but cheerly still; and said, "i pray thee, then
write me as one that loves his fellow-men
the angel wrote, and vanished. the next night
it came again, with a great wakening light
and showed the names whom love of god had blessed

poem is just as popular as it ever was
over the hill the farm-boy goes
his shadow lengthens along the land
a giant staff in a giant hand
in the poplar-tree, above the spring
the katydid begins to sing
the early dews are falling
into the stone-heap darts the mink
the swallows skim the river's brink
and home to the woodland fly the crows
when over the hill the farm-boy goes
cheerily calling
farther, farther over the hill
faintly calling, calling still
into the yard the farmer goes
with grateful heart, at the close of day
harness and chain are hung away
in the wagon-shed stand yoke and plow
the straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow
the cooling dews are falling
the friendly sheep his welcome bleat
the pigs come grunting to his feet
the whinnying mare her master knows
when into the yard the farmer goes
his cattle calling
while still the cow-boy, far away
goes seeking those that have gone astray
now to her task the milkmaid goes
the cattle come crowding through the gate
lowing, pushing, little and great
about the trough, by the farm-yard pump
the frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump
while the pleasant dews are falling
the new-milch heifer is quick and shy
but the old cow waits with tranquil eye
and the white stream into the bright pail flows
when to her task the milkmaid goes
soothingly calling
the cheerful milkmaid takes her stool
and sits and milks in the twilight cool
saying, "so! so, boss! so! so
to supper at last the farmer goes
the apples are pared, the paper read
the stories are told, then all to bed
without, the crickets' ceaseless song
makes shrill the silence all night long
the heavy dews are falling
the housewife's hand has turned the lock
drowsily ticks the kitchen clock
the household sinks to deep repose
but still in sleep the farm-boy goes
singing, calling
and oft the milkmaid, in her dreams
drums in the pail with the flashing streams
murmuring, "so, boss! so
on turning up her nest with the plow, november, 1785
the ineffable touches of tenderness that illumine the sturdy plowman
the contrast between the strong man and the delicate flower or creature
at his mercy makes tenderness in man a vital point in character
the lines "to a mouse" seem by report to have been composed while burns
was actually plowing. one of the poet's first editors wrote: "john
blane, who had acted as gaudsman to burns, and who lived sixty years
afterward, had a distinct recollection of the turning up of the mouse
like a thoughtless youth as he was, he ran after the creature to kill
it, but was checked and recalled by his master, who he observed became
thereafter thoughtful and abstracted. burns, who treated his servants
with the familiarity of fellow-labourers, soon afterward read the poem
to blane

o' clod or stane
adorns the histie stibble-field
unseen, alane
there, in thy scanty mantle clad
thy snawie bosom sunward spread
thou lifts thy unassuming head
in humble guise
but now the share uptears thy bed
and low thou lies
such is the fate of artless maid
sweet floweret of the rural shade
by love's simplicity betrayed
and guileless trust
till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid
low i' the dust
such is the fate of simple bard
on life's rough ocean luckless starr'd
unskilful he to note the card
of prudent lore
till billows rage, and gales blow hard
and whelm him o'er
such fate to suffering worth is given
who long with wants and woes has striven
by human pride or cunning driven
to misery's brink
till wrenched of every stay but heaven
he, ruined, sink
even thou who mourn'st the daisy's fate
that fate is thine--no distant date
stern ruin's plowshare drives, elate
full on thy bloom
till crushed beneath the furrow's weight
shall be thy doom
woman (not necessarily an old lady) _worthy of her years_. old age is
honourable if it carries a head that has a halo. (1807-92
up from the meadows rich with corn
clear in the cool september morn
the clustered spires of frederick stand
green-walled by the hills of maryland
roundabout them orchards sweep
apple and peach tree fruited deep
fair as the garden of the lord
to the eyes of the famished rebel horde
on that pleasant morn of the early fall
when lee marched over the mountain-wall
over the mountains winding down
horse and foot, into frederick town
forty flags with their silver stars
forty flags with their crimson bars
flapped in the morning wind: the sun
of noon looked down, and saw not one
up rose old barbara frietchie then
bowed with her fourscore years and ten
bravest of all in frederick town
she took up the flag the men hauled down
in her attic window the staff she set
to show that one heart was loyal yet
up the street came the rebel tread
stonewall jackson riding ahead
under his slouched hat left and right
he glanced: the old flag met his sight
it shivered the window, pane and sash
it rent the banner with seam and gash
quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
dame barbara snatched the silken scarf
she leaned far out on the window-sill
and shook it forth with a royal will
but spare your country's flag," she said
a shade of sadness, a blush of shame
over the face of the leader came
the nobler nature within him stirred
to life at that woman's deed and word
dies like a dog! march on!" he said
all day long through frederick street
sounded the tread of marching feet
all day long that free flag tost
over the heads of the rebel host
even its torn folds rose and fell
on the loyal winds that loved it well
and through the hill-gaps sunset light
shone over it with a warm good-night
barbara frietchie's work is o'er
and the rebel rides on his raids no more
honour to her! and let a tear
fall, for her sake, on stonewall's bier
over barbara frietchie's grave
flag of freedom and union, wave
peace and order and beauty draw
round thy symbol of light and law
and ever the stars above look down
on thy stars below in frederick town

oh, young lochinvar is come out of the west
through all the wide border his steed was the best
and save his good broadsword he weapons had none
he rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone
so faithful in love, and so dauntless in war
there never was knight like the young lochinvar
he stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone
he swam the eske river where ford there was none
but ere he alighted at netherby gate
the bride had consented, the gallant came late
for a laggard in love, and a dastard in war
was to wed the fair ellen of brave lochinvar
so boldly he entered the netherby hall
among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and all
then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword
or to dance at our bridal, young lord lochinvar
love swells like the solway, but ebbs like its tide
and now am i come, with this lost love of mine
to lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine
there are maidens in scotland more lovely by far
that would gladly be bride to the young lochinvar
the bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up
he quaffed of the wine, and he threw down the cup
she looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh
with a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye
he took her soft hand ere her mother could bar
so stately his form, and so lovely her face
that never a hall such a galliard did grace
while her mother did fret, and her father did fume
and the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume
and the bridemaidens whispered, "'twere better by far
to have matched our fair cousin with young lochinvar
one touch to her hand, and one word in her ear
when they reached the hall door, and the charger stood near
so light to the croupe the fair lady he swung
so light to the saddle before her he sprung
they'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young lochinvar
there was mounting 'mong græmes of the netherby clan
forsters, fenwicks, and musgraves, they rode and they ran
there was racing and chasing, on cannobie lee
but the lost bride of netherby ne'er did they see
so daring in love, and so dauntless in war
have ye e'er heard of gallant like young lochinvar
a chieftain, to the highlands bound
cries, "boatman, do not tarry
and i'll give thee a silver pound
to row us o'er the ferry
this dark and stormy water
and this lord ullin's daughter
three days we've fled together
for should he find us in the glen
my blood would stain the heather
should they our steps discover
then who will cheer my bonny bride
when they have slain her lover
outspoke the hardy highland wight
it is not for your silver bright
but for your winsome lady
in danger shall not tarry
so though the waves are raging white
i'll row you o'er the ferry
by this the storm grew loud apace
the water-wraith was shrieking
and in the scowl of heaven each face
grew dark as they were speaking
but still as wilder blew the wind
and as the night grew drearer
adown the glen rode armèd men
their trampling sounded nearer
i'll meet the raging of the skies
but not an angry father
the boat has left a stormy land
a stormy sea before her
when, oh! too strong for human hand
the tempest gathered o'er her
and still they row'd amid the roar
of waters fast prevailing
lord ullin reach'd that fatal shore
his wrath was changed to wailing
for sore dismay'd through storm and shade
his child he did discover
one lovely hand she stretch'd for aid
and one was round her lover
and i'll forgive your highland chief
my daughter!--oh my daughter
return or aid preventing
the waters wild went o'er his child
and he was left lamenting
obedience under stern necessity. obedience is the salvation of any
army. john burroughs says: "i never hear that poem but what it thrills
me through and through
half a league, half a league
half a league onward
all in the valley of death
rode the six hundred
charge for the guns!" he said
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred
was there a man dismay'd
not tho' the soldier knew
some one had blunder'd
theirs not to make reply
theirs not to reason why
theirs but to do and die
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred
cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon in front of them
volley'd and thunder'd
storm'd at with shot and shell
boldly they rode and well
into the jaws of death
into the mouth of hell
rode the six hundred
flash'd all their sabers bare
flash'd as they turn'd in air
sab'ring the gunners there
charging an army, while
all the world wonder'd
plunged in the battery-smoke
right thro' the line they broke
cossack and russian
reel'd from the saber-stroke
shatter'd and sunder'd
then they rode back, but not
not the six hundred
cannon to right of them
cannon to left of them
cannon behind them
volleyed and thundered
stormed at with shot and shell
while horse and hero fell
they that had fought so well
came through the jaws of death
back from the mouth of hell
all that was left of them
left of six hundred
when can their glory fade
oh, the wild charge they made
all the world wondered
honour the charge they made
honour the light brigade
noble six hundred
there are several of sidney lanier's (1842-81) poems that children love
to learn. "tampa robins," "the tournament" (joust 1.), "barnacles
alabama" are among them. at our "poetry contests" the children have
plainly demonstrated that this great poet has reached his hand down to
the youngest. the time will doubtless come when it will be a part of
education to be acquainted with lanier, as it is now to be acquainted
with longfellow or tennyson
bright shone the lists, blue bent the skies
and the knights still hurried amain
to the tournament under the ladies' eyes
where the jousters were heart and brain
flourished the trumpets, entered heart
a youth in crimson and gold
flourished again; brain stood apart
steel-armoured, dark and cold
heart's palfrey caracoled gaily round
heart tra-li-ra'd merrily
but brain sat still, with never a sound
so cynical-calm was he
heart's helmet-crest bore favours three
from his lady's white hand caught
while brain wore a plumeless casque; not he
or favour gave or sought
the trumpet blew; heart shot a glance
to catch his lady's eye
but brain gazed straight ahead, his lance
to aim more faithfully
they charged, they struck; both fell, both bled
brain rose again, ungloved
heart, dying, smiled and faintly said
little laddie, do you remember learning "the wind and the moon"? you
were eight or nine years old, and you shut your eyes and puffed out
your cheeks when you came to the line "he blew and he blew." the saucy
wind made a great racket and the calm moon never noticed it. that gave
you a great deal of pleasure, didn't it? we did not care much for the
noisy, conceited wind. (1824
said the wind to the moon, "i will blow you out
you stare
in the air
like a ghost in a chair
always looking what i am about
i hate to be watched; i'll blow you out
the wind blew hard, and out went the moon
so, deep
on a heap
of clouds to sleep
down lay the wind, and slumbered soon
muttering low, "i've done for that moon
he turned in his bed; she was there again
on high
in the sky
with her one ghost eye
the moon shone white and alive and plain
said the wind, "i will blow you out again
the wind blew hard, and the moon grew dim
and my wedge
i have knocked off her edge
if only i blow right fierce and grim
the creature will soon be dimmer than dim
he blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread
more's enough
to blow her to snuff
one good puff more where the last was bred
and glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread
he blew a great blast, and the thread was gone
in the air
nowhere
was a moonbeam bare
far off and harmless the shy stars shone
sure and certain the moon was gone
the wind he took to his revels once more
on down
in town
like a merry-mad clown
he leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar
he flew in a rage--he danced and blew
but in vain
was the pain
of his bursting brain
for still the broader the moon-scrap grew
the broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew
slowly she grew--till she filled the night
and shone
on her throne
in the sky alone
a matchless, wonderful silvery light
radiant and lovely, the queen of the night
with my breath
good faith
i blew her to death
first blew her away right out of the sky
but the moon she knew nothing about the affair
for high
in the sky
with her one white eye
motionless, miles above the air
she had never heard the great wind blare
favour of honest toil. (1848
joseph the carpenter--same trade as me
i thought as i'd find it--i knew it was here
but my sight's getting queer
i don't know right where as his shed must ha' stood
but often, as i've been a-planing my wood
i've took off my hat, just with thinking of he
at the same work as me
he warn't that set up that he couldn't stoop down
and work in the country for folks in the town
and i'll warrant he felt a bit pride, like i've done
at a good job begun
the parson he knows that i'll not make too free
but on sunday i feels as pleased as can be
when i wears my clean smock, and sits in a pew
and has taught a few
i think of as how not the parson hissen
as is teacher and father and shepherd o' men
not he knows as much of the lord in that shed
where he earned his own bread
and when i goes home to my missus, says she
for she knows my queer ways, and my love for the shed
so i comes right away by mysen, with the book
and i turns the old pages and has a good look
for the text as i've found, as tells me as he
were the same trade as me
why don't i mark it? ah, many say so
but i think i'd as lief, with your leaves, let it go
it do seem that nice when i fall on it sudden

covers all europe with her dainty hands and tresses while giving a kiss
to england, her own dear native land. (1808-79
when letty had scarce pass'd her third glad year
and her young, artless words began to flow
one day we gave the child a colour'd sphere
of the wide earth, that she might mark and know
by tint and outline, all its sea and land
she patted all the world; old empires peep'd
between her baby fingers; her soft hand
was welcome at all frontiers. how she leap'd
and laugh'd and prattled in her world-wide bliss
but when we turn'd her sweet unlearned eye
on our own isle, she rais'd a joyous cry
and, while she hid all england with a kiss
bright over europe fell her golden hair
once a dream did wave a shade
o'er my angel-guarded bed
that an emmet lost its way
when on grass methought i lay
troubled, 'wildered, and forlorn
dark, benighted, travel-worn
over many a tangled spray
all heart-broke, i heard her say
do they hear their father sigh
now they look abroad to see
now return and weep for me
pitying, i dropped a tear
but i saw a glow-worm near
who replied, "what wailing wight
calls the watchman of the night
while the beetle goes his round
follow now the beetle's hum
little wanderer, hie thee home
j.g. holland (1819-81) has immortalised himself in this line, at least
heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to its summit round by round
i count this thing to be grandly true
that a noble deed is a step toward god
lifting the soul from the common clod
to a purer air and a broader view
have you been to woodstock, near oxford, england? if so, you have seen
the palace of the duke of marlborough, who won the battle of blenheim
the main point of the poem is the doubtful honour in killing in our
great wars. southey, the poet, lived from 1774 to 1843
it was a summer's evening
old kaspar's work was done
and he before his cottage door
was sitting in the sun
and by him sported on the green
his little grandchild wilhelmine
she saw her brother peterkin
roll something large and round
which he, beside the rivulet
in playing there, had found
he came to ask what he had found
that was so large, and smooth, and round
old kaspar took it from the boy
who stood expectant by
and then the old man shook his head
and, with a natural sigh
for there's many hereabout
and often when i go to plow
the plowshare turns them out
for many thousand men," said he
young peterkin he cries
and little wilhelmine looks up
with wonder-waiting eyes
and what they killed each other for
but what they killed each other for
i could not well make out
but everybody said," quoth he
yon little stream hard by
they burned his dwelling to the ground
and he was forced to fly
so with his wife and child he fled
nor had he where to rest his head
was wasted far and wide
and many a childing mother then
and new-born baby died
but things like that, you know, must be
at every famous victory
after the field was won
for many thousand bodies here
lay rotting in the sun
but things like that, you know, must be
after a famous victory
and our good prince eugene
said little wilhelmine
who this great fight did win
quoth little peterkin
respect to a boy of eleven years who liked the poem well enough to
recite it frequently. the scene is laid on helvellyn, to me the most
impressive mountain of the lake district of england. wordsworth is a
part of this country. i once heard john burroughs say: "i went to the
lake district to see what kind of a country it could be that would
produce a wordsworth
a barking sound the shepherd hears
a cry as of a dog or fox
he halts--and searches with his eyes
among the scattered rocks
and now at distance can discern
a stirring in a brake of fern
and instantly a dog is seen
glancing through that covert green
the dog is not of mountain breed
its motions, too, are wild and shy
with something, as the shepherd thinks
unusual in its cry
nor is there any one in sight
all round, in hollow or on height
nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear
what is the creature doing here
it was a cove, a huge recess
that keeps, till june, december's snow
a lofty precipice in front
a silent tarn below
far in the bosom of helvellyn
remote from public road or dwelling
pathway, or cultivated land
from trace of human foot or hand
there sometimes doth a leaping fish
send through the tarn a lonely cheer
the crags repeat the raven's croak
in symphony austere
thither the rainbow comes--the cloud
and mists that spread the flying shroud
and sunbeams; and the sounding blast
that, if it could, would hurry past
but that enormous barrier binds it fast
not free from boding thoughts, a while
the shepherd stood: then makes his way
toward the dog, o'er rocks and stones
as quickly as he may
nor far had gone, before he found
a human skeleton on the ground
the appalled discoverer with a sigh
looks round, to learn the history
from those abrupt and perilous rocks
the man had fallen, that place of fear
at length upon the shepherd's mind
it breaks, and all is clear
he instantly recalled the name
and who he was, and whence he came
remembered, too, the very day
on which the traveller passed this way
but hear a wonder, for whose sake
this lamentable tale i tell
a lasting monument of words
this wonder merits well
the dog, which still was hovering nigh
repeating the same timid cry
this dog had been through three months space
a dweller in that savage place
yes, proof was plain that, since the day
when this ill-fated traveller died
the dog had watched about the spot
or by his master's side
how nourished here through such long time
he knows, who gave that love sublime
and gave that strength of feeling, great
above all human estimate
people are more and more coming to recognise the fact that each
individual soul has a right to its own stages of development. "the
chambered nautilus" is for that reason beloved of the masses. it is one
of the grandest poems ever written. "build thee more stately mansions
o my soul!" this line alone would make the poem immortal. (1809-94
this is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign
sailed the unshadowed main
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings
and coral reefs lie bare
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair
its webs of living gauze no more unfurl
wrecked is the ship of pearl
and every chambered cell
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell
before thee lies revealed
its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed
year after year beheld the silent toil
that spread his lustrous coil
still, as the spiral grew
he left the past year's dwelling for the new
stole with soft step its shining archway through
built up its idle door
stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more
thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee
child of the wandering sea
cast from her lap, forlorn
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreathed horn
while on mine ear it rings
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings
build thee more stately mansions, o my soul
as the swift seasons roll
leave thy low-vaulted past
let each new temple, nobler than the last
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea
tennyson's (1809-92) "crossing the bar" is one of the noblest
death-songs ever written. i include it in this volume out of respect to
a young philadelphia publisher who recited it one stormy night before
the passengers of a ship when i was crossing the atlantic, and also
because so many young people have the good taste to love it. it has
been said that next to browning's "prospice" it is the greatest
death-song ever written
sunset and evening star
and one clear call for me
and may there be no moaning of the bar
when i put out to sea
but such a tide as moving seems asleep
too full for sound and foam
when that which drew from out the boundless deep
turns again home
twilight and evening bell
and after that the dark
and may there be no sadness of farewell
when i embark
for tho' from out our bourne of time and place
the flood may bear me far
i hope to see my pilot face to face
when i have cross'd the bar
when one boy learns it the others want to follow. it takes as a hero
the man who gives common service--the one who does not lead or command
but follows the line of duty. (1865

school-reader. boys and girls liked it then and they like it now. this
is another of the poems that was not born to die
at midnight, in his guarded tent
the turk was dreaming of the hour
when greece, her knee in suppliance bent
should tremble at his power
in dreams, through camp and court, he bore
the trophies of a conqueror
in dreams his song of triumph heard
then wore his monarch's signet ring
then pressed that monarch's throne--a king
as wild his thoughts, and gay of wing
as eden's garden bird
at midnight, in the forest shades
bozzaris ranged his suliote band
true as the steel of their tried blades
heroes in heart and hand
there had the persian's thousands stood
there had the glad earth drunk their blood
on old platæa's day
and now there breathed that haunted air
the sons of sires who conquered there
with arm to strike and soul to dare
as quick, as far as they
an hour passed on--the turk awoke
that bright dream was his last
he woke--to hear his sentries shriek
he woke--to die midst flame, and smoke
and shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke
and death-shots falling thick and fast
as lightnings from the mountain-cloud
and heard, with voice as trumpet loud
bozzaris cheer his band
strike--for your altars and your fires
strike--for the green graves of your sires
god--and your native land
they fought--like brave men, long and well
they piled that ground with moslem slain
they conquered--but bozzaris fell
bleeding at every vein
his few surviving comrades saw
his smile when rang their proud hurrah
and the red field was won
then saw in death his eyelids close
calmly, as to a night's repose
like flowers at set of sun
come to the bridal-chamber, death
come to the mother's, when she feels
for the first time, her first-born's breath
come when the blessed seals
that close the pestilence are broke
and crowded cities wail its stroke
come in consumption's ghastly form
the earthquake shock, the ocean storm
come when the heart beats high and warm
with banquet-song, and dance, and wine
and thou art terrible--the tear
the groan, the knell, the pall, the bier
and all we know, or dream, or fear
of agony, are thine
but to the hero, when his sword
has won the battle for the free
thy voice sounds like a prophet's word
and in its hollow tones are heard
the thanks of millions yet to be
come, when his task of fame is wrought
come, with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought
come in her crowning hour--and then
thy sunken eye's unearthly light
to him is welcome as the sight
of sky and stars to prisoned men
thy grasp is welcome as the hand
of brother in a foreign land
thy summons welcome as the cry
that told the indian isles were nigh
to the world-seeking genoese
when the land wind, from woods of palm
and orange-groves, and fields of balm
blew o'er the haytian seas
bozzaris! with the storied brave
greece nurtured in her glory's time
rest thee--there is no prouder grave
even in her own proud clime
she wore no funeral-weeds for thee
nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume
like torn branch from death's leafless tree
in sorrow's pomp and pageantry
the heartless luxury of the tomb
but she remembers thee as one
long loved and for a season gone
for thee her poet's lyre is wreathed
her marble wrought, her music breathed
for thee she rings the birthday bells
of thee her babe's first lisping tells
for thine her evening prayer is said
at palace-couch and cottage-bed
her soldier, closing with the foe
gives for thy sake a deadlier blow
his plighted maiden, when she fears
for him the joy of her young years
thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears
and she, the mother of thy boys
though in her eye and faded cheek
is read the grief she will not speak
the memory of her buried joys
and even she who gave thee birth
will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth
talk of thy doom without a sigh
for thou art freedom's now, and fame's
one of the few, the immortal names
that were not born to die
of the good old reader songs taught us by a teacher of good taste. we
love those teachers more the older we grow
wild was the night, yet a wilder night
hung round the soldier's pillow
in his bosom there waged a fiercer fight
than the fight on the wrathful billow
a few fond mourners were kneeling by
the few that his stern heart cherished
they knew, by his glazed and unearthly eye
that life had nearly perished
they knew by his awful and kingly look
by the order hastily spoken
that he dreamed of days when the nations shook
and the nations' hosts were broken
he dreamed that the frenchman's sword still slew
and triumphed the frenchman's eagle
and the struggling austrian fled anew
like the hare before the beagle
the bearded russian he scourged again
the prussian's camp was routed
and again on the hills of haughty spain
his mighty armies shouted
over egypt's sands, over alpine snows
at the pyramids, at the mountain
where the wave of the lordly danube flows
and by the italian fountain
on the snowy cliffs where mountain streams
dash by the switzer's dwelling
he led again, in his dying dreams
his hosts, the proud earth quelling
again marengo's field was won
and jena's bloody battle
again the world was overrun
made pale at his cannon's rattle
he died at the close of that darksome day
a day that shall live in story
in the rocky land they placed his clay
how sleep the brave, who sink to rest
by all their country's wishes blest
when spring, with dewy fingers cold
returns to deck their hallow'd mould
she there shall dress a sweeter sod
than fancy's feet have ever trod
by fairy hands their knell is rung
by forms unseen their dirge is sung
there honour comes, a pilgrim gray
to bless the turf that wraps their clay
and freedom shall a while repair
to dwell a weeping hermit there

a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
a flash of colour beneath the sky
hats off
the flag is passing by
blue and crimson and white it shines
over the steel-tipped, ordered lines
hats off
the colours before us fly
but more than the flag is passing by
sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great
fought to make and to save the state
weary marches and sinking ships
cheers of victory on dying lips
days of plenty and years of peace
march of a strong land's swift increase
equal justice, right, and law
stately honour and reverend awe
sign of a nation, great and strong
toward her people from foreign wrong
pride and glory and honour,--all

on linden, when the sun was low
all bloodless lay th' untrodden snow
and dark as winter was the flow
of iser, rolling rapidly
but linden saw another sight
when the drum beat, at dead of night
commanding fires of death to light
the darkness of her scenery
by torch and trumpet fast array'd
each horseman drew his battle-blade
and furious every charger neigh'd
to join the dreadful revelry
then shook the hills with thunder riven
then rush'd the steed to battle driven
and louder than the bolts of heaven
far flashed the red artillery
but redder yet that light shall glow
on linden's hills or stainèd snow
and bloodier yet the torrent flow
of iser, rolling rapidly
can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun
where furious frank, and fiery hun
shout in their sulphurous canopy
the combat deepens. on, ye brave
who rush to glory or the grave
wave, munich! all thy banners wave
and charge with all thy chivalry
few, few shall part, where many meet
the snow shall be their winding-sheet
and every turf beneath their feet
shall be a soldier's sepulcher

the corn-top's ripe, and the meadow's in the bloom
while the birds make music all the day
the young folks roll on the little cabin floor
all merry, all happy and bright
by-'n'-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door
then my old kentucky home, good-night
weep no more, my lady
o, weep no more to-day
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home
for the old kentucky home, far away
they hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon
on the meadow, the hill, and the shore
they sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
on the bench by the old cabin door
the day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart
with sorrow, where all was delight
the time has come when the darkeys have to part
then my old kentucky home, good-night
the head must bow, and the back will have to bend
wherever the darkey may go
a few more days, and the trouble all will end
in the field where the sugar-canes grow
a few more days for to tote the weary load
no matter, 'twill never be light
a few more days till we totter on the road

woe," off the coast near cape ann, is a historic poem as well as an
imaginative composition
it was the schooner _hesperus
that sailed the wintry sea
and the skipper had taken his little daughter
to bear him company
blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax
her cheeks like the dawn of day
and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds
that ope in the month of may
the skipper he stood beside the helm
his pipe was in his mouth
and he watched how the veering flaw did blow
the smoke now west, now south
then up and spake an old sailor
had sailed the spanish main
for i fear a hurricane
and to-night no moon we see
the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe
and a scornful laugh laughed he
colder and louder blew the wind
a gale from the northeast
the snow fell hissing in the brine
and the billows frothed like yeast
down came the storm, and smote amain
the vessel in its strength
she shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed
then leaped her cable's length
and do not tremble so
for i can weather the roughest gale
that ever wind did blow
he wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
against the stinging blast
he cut a rope from a broken spar
and bound her to the mast
o say, what may it be
and he steered for the open sea
o say, what may it be
in such an angry sea
o say, what may it be
but the father answered never a word
a frozen corpse was he
lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark
with his face turned to the skies
the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
on his fixed and glassy eyes
then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
that savèd she might be
and she thought of christ, who stilled the wave
on the lake of galilee
and fast through the midnight dark and drear
through the whistling sleet and snow
like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept
toward the reef of norman's woe
and ever the fitful gusts between
a sound came from the land
it was the sound of the trampling surf
on the rocks and the hard sea-sand
the breakers were right beneath her bows
she drifted a dreary wreck
and a whooping billow swept the crew
like icicles from her deck
she struck where the white and fleecy waves
looked soft as carded wool
but the cruel rocks they gored her side
like the horns of an angry bull
her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice
with the masts went by the board
like a vessel of glass she stove and sank
ho! ho! the breakers roared
at daybreak on the bleak sea-beach
a fisherman stood aghast
to see the form of a maiden fair
lashed close to a drifting mast
the salt sea was frozen on her breast
the salt tears in her eyes
and he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed
on the billows fall and rise
such was the wreck of the _hesperus
in the midnight and the snow
christ save us all from a death like this
on the reef of norman's woe

the man is wrecked and his ship is sunken before he ever steps on board
or sees the water if his heart is hard and his estimate of human beings
low. "the inchcape rock" is a thrust at hard-heartedness. "what is the
use of life?" to bear one another's burdens, to develop a genius for
pulling people through hard places--that's the use of life. it is the
last resort of a mean mind to crack jokes that wreck innocent voyagers
on life's sea. (1774-1843
no stir in the air, no stir in the sea
the ship was still as she could be
her sails from heaven received no motion
her keel was steady in the ocean
without either sign or sound of their shock
the waves flowed over the inchcape rock
so little they rose, so little they fell
they did not move the inchcape bell
the abbot of aberbrothok
had placed that bell on the inchcape rock
on a buoy in the storm it floated and swung
and over the waves its warning rung
when the rock was hid by the surge's swell
the mariners heard the warning bell
and then they knew the perilous rock
and blest the abbot of aberbrothok
the sun in heaven was shining gay
all things were joyful on that day
the sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round
and there was joyance in their sound
the buoy of the inchcape bell was seen
a dark spot on the ocean green
sir ralph the rover walked his deck
and he fixed his eye on the darker speck
he felt the cheering power of spring
it made him whistle, it made him sing
his heart was mirthful to excess
but the rover's mirth was wickedness
his eye was on the inchcape float
quoth he, "my men, put out the boat
and row me to the inchcape rock
and i'll plague the abbot of aberbrothok
the boat is lowered, the boatmen row
and to the inchcape rock they go
sir ralph bent over from the boat
and he cut the bell from the inchcape float
down sank the bell with a gurgling sound
the bubbles rose and burst around
quoth sir ralph, "the next who comes to the rock
won't bless the abbot of aberbrothok
sir ralph the rover sailed away
he scoured the sea for many a day
and now grown rich with plundered store
he steers his course for scotland's shore
so thick a haze o'erspread the sky
they cannot see the sun on high
the wind hath blown a gale all day
at evening it hath died away
on the deck the rover takes his stand
so dark it is they see no land
quoth sir ralph, "it will be brighter soon
for there is the dawn of the rising moon
for methinks we should be near the shore
but i wish i could hear the inchcape bell
they hear no sound; the swell is strong
though the wind hath fallen, they drift along
till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock
sir ralph the rover tore his hair
he curst himself in his despair
the waves rush in on every side
the ship is sinking beneath the tide
but, even in his dying fear
one dreadful sound could the rover hear
a sound as if with the inchcape bell
the devil below was ringing his knell
have learned it they know the meaning of every line and have caught the
spirit of the verse. there is an ancient "lyre," or violin, made in
northern africa, in the possession of a boston lady, and i have found
the mud-turtle rattle among the indians on the indian reservation at
syracuse, new york. they use it as a musical instrument in their
thanksgiving dances. the poem helps to build an interest in history and
mythology while it develops a child's reverence and insight. (1819-91
there lay upon the ocean's shore
what once a tortoise served to cover
a year and more, with rush and roar
the surf had rolled it over
had played with it, and flung it by
as wind and weather might decide it
then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry
cheap burial might provide it
it rested there to bleach or tan
the rains had soaked, the sun had burned it
with many a ban the fisherman
had stumbled o'er and spurned it
and there the fisher-girl would stay
conjecturing with her brother
how in their play the poor estray
might serve some use or other
so there it lay, through wet and dry
as empty as the last new sonnet
till by and by came mercury
and, having mused upon it
in shape, material, and dimension
give it but strings, and, lo, it sings
a wonderful invention
so said, so done; the chords he strained
and, as his fingers o'er them hovered
the shell disdained a soul had gained
the lyre had been discovered
o empty world that round us lies
dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken
brought we but eyes like mercury's
in thee what songs should waken
too, in stedman's collection. we all come to a point in life where we
need to burst the shell and fly away into the new realm. (1835-98
my little mädchen found one day
a curious something in her play
that was not fruit, nor flower, nor seed
it was not anything that grew
or crept, or climbed, or swam, or flew
had neither legs nor wings, indeed
and yet she was not sure, she said
whether it was alive or dead
she brought it in her tiny hand
to see if i would understand
and wondered when i made reply
with doubtful look she answered me
so then i told her what would be
some day within the chrysalis
how, slowly, in the dull brown thing
now still as death, a spotted wing
and then another, would unfold
till from the empty shell would fly
a pretty creature, by and by
all radiant in blue and gold
her laughing lips and eager eyes
all in a sparkle of surprise
that ere the worm within its shell
its gauzy, splendid wings had spread
my little mädchen would be dead
to-day the butterfly has flown
she was not here to see it fly
and sorrowing i wonder why
the empty shell is mine alone
perhaps the secret lies in this
i too had found a chrysalis
and death that robbed me of delight
was but the radiant creature's flight

there came to port last sunday night
the queerest little craft
without an inch of rigging on
i looked and looked and laughed
it seemed so curious that she
should cross the unknown water
and moor herself right in my room
my daughter, o my daughter
yet by these presents witness all
she's welcome fifty times
and comes consigned to hope and love
and common-meter rhymes
she has no manifest but this
no flag floats o'er the water
she's too new for the british lloyds

ring out, wild bells, and tame ones too
ring out the lover's moon
ring in the little worsted socks
ring in the bib and spoon
ring out the muse! ring in the nurse
ring in the milk and water

i chatter, chatter, as i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever
i wind about, and in and out
with here a blossom sailing
and here and there a lusty trout
and here and there a grayling

i slide by hazel covers
i move the sweet forget-me-nots
that grow for happy lovers
i slip, i slide, i gloom, i glance
among my skimming swallows
i make the netted sunbeams dance
against my sandy shallows
i murmur under moon and stars
in brambly wildernesses
i linger by my shingly bars
i loiter round my cresses
and out again i curve and flow

it was our war-ship _clampherdown
would sweep the channel clean
wherefore she kept her hatches close
when the merry channel chops arose
to save the bleached marine
she had one bow-gun of a hundred ton
and a great stern-gun beside
they dipped their noses deep in the sea
they racked their stays and stanchions free
in the wash of the wind-whipped tide
it was our war-ship _clampherdown
fell in with a cruiser light
that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun
and a pair o' heels wherewith to run
from the grip of a close-fought fight
she opened fire at seven miles
as ye shoot at a bobbing cork
and once she fired and twice she fired
till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
that lolls upon the stalk
the deck-beams break below
and botch the shattered plates again
and he answered, "make it so
she opened fire within the mile
as ye shoot at the flying duck
and the great stern-gun shot fair and true
with the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue
and the great stern-turret stuck
the feed-pipes burst below
you can hear the hiss of helpless ram
you can hear the twisted runners jam
and he answered, "turn and go
it was our war-ship _clampherdown
and grimly did she roll
swung round to take the cruiser's fire
as the white whale faces the thresher's ire
when they war by the frozen pole
and faster still fall we
and it is not meet for english stock

we drift upon her beam

that carried an armour-belt
but fifty feet at stern and bow
lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow
to the hail of the nordenfeldt
the chilled steel bolts are swift
we have emptied the bunkers in open sea
their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
and he answered, "let her drift
it was our war-ship _clampherdown
swung round upon the tide
her two dumb guns glared south and north
and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
and she ground the cruiser's side

and the scalded stokers yelped delight
as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight

they cleared the cruiser end to end
from conning-tower to hold
they fought as they fought in nelson's fleet
they were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet
as it was in the days of old

and carried a million pounds in steel
to the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel

the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold
and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold
and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea
when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee
like the leaves of the forest when the summer is green
that host with their banners at sunset were seen
like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown
that host on the morrow lay withered and strown
for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast
and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed
and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill
and their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still
and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide
but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride
and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf
and cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf
and there lay the rider distorted and pale
with the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail
and the tents were all silent, the banners alone
the lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown
and the widows of ashur are loud in their wail
and the idols are broke in the temple of baal
and the might of the gentile, unsmote by the sword
hath melted like snow in the glance of the lord
i remember, i remember
the house where i was born
the little window where the sun
came peeping in at morn
he never came a wink too soon
nor brought too long a day
but now, i often wish the night
had borne my breath away
i remember, i remember
the roses, red and white
the violets, and the lily-cups
those flowers made of light
the lilacs where the robin built
and where my brother set
the laburnum on his birthday
the tree is living yet
i remember, i remember
where i was used to swing
and thought the air must rush as fresh
to swallows on the wing
my spirit flew in feathers then
that is so heavy now
and summer pools could hardly cool
the fever on my brow
i remember, i remember
the fir trees dark and high
i used to think their slender tops
were close against the sky
it was a childish ignorance
but now 'tis little joy
to know i'm farther off from heaven
than when i was a boy
out of the clover and blue-eyed grass
he turned them into the river lane
one after another he let them pass
then fastened the meadow bars again
under the willows and over the hill
he patiently followed their sober pace
the merry whistle for once was still
and something shadowed the sunny face
only a boy! and his father had said
he never could let his youngest go
two already were lying dead
under the feet of the trampling foe
but after the evening work was done
and the frogs were loud in the meadow-swamp
over his shoulder he slung his gun
and stealthily followed the footpath damp
across the clover, and through the wheat
with resolute heart and purpose grim
though the dew was on his hurrying feet
and the blind bat's flitting startled him
thrice since then had the lanes been white
and the orchards sweet with apple-bloom
and now, when the cows came back at night
the feeble father drove them home
for news had come to the lonely farm
that three were lying where two had lain
and the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
could never lean on a son's again
the summer day grew cool and late
he went for the cows when the work was done
but down the lane, as he opened the gate
he saw them coming one by one
brindle, ebony, speckle, and bess
shaking their horns in the evening wind
cropping the buttercups out of the grass
but who was it following close behind
loosely swung in the idle air
the empty sleeve of army blue
and worn and pale, from the crisping hair
looked out a face that the father knew
for close-barred prisons will sometimes yawn
and yield their dead unto life again
and the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
in golden glory at last may wane
the great tears sprang to their meeting eyes
for the heart must speak when the lips are dumb
and under the silent evening skies
together they followed the cattle home

it was summer when he smiled

stretched its white arms out to him
calling, "sun-child, come to me
let me warm my heart with thee
but the child heard not the sea
calling, yearning evermore
for the summer on the shore
krinken on the beach one day
saw a maiden nis at play
on the pebbly beach she played
in the summer krinken made
fair, and very fair, was she
just a little child was he
just a kiss, and go with me
to the summer-lands that be
down within the silver sea
krinken was a little child
by the maiden nis beguiled
hand in hand with her went he
and 'twas summer in the sea
and the hoary sea and grim
to its bosom folded him
clasped and kissed the little form
and the ocean's heart was warm
now the sea calls out no more
it is winter on the shore
winter where that little child
made sweet summer when he smiled
though 'tis summer on the sea
where with maiden nis went he
it is winter on the shore
winter, winter evermore
of the summer on the deep
come sweet visions in my sleep
these my dreams of summer be

by the maiden nis beguiled
oft the hoary sea and grim
reached its longing arms to him
crying, "sim-child, come to me
let me warm my heart with thee
but the sea calls out no more
it is winter on the shore
winter, cold and dark and wild

it was summer when he smiled
down he went into the sea

she spoke to stevenson--the master smiled
too swift they come, and all too swiftly fly
so by a formal deed he there conveyed
all right and title in his natal day
to have and hold, to sell or give away
then signed, and gave it to the little maid
joyful, yet fearing to believe too much
she took the deed, but scarcely dared unfold
ah, liberal genius! at whose potent touch
all common things shine with transmuted gold

not part of time, but immortality

at last bishop hatto appointed a day
to quiet the poor without delay
he bade them to his great barn repair
and they should have food for winter there
rejoiced such tidings good to hear
the poor folk flocked from far and near
the great barn was full as it could hold
of women and children, and young and old
then, when he saw it could hold no more
bishop hatto, he made fast the door
and while for mercy on christ they call
he set fire to the barn and burned them all
for ridding it in these times forlorn
of rats that only consume the corn
so then to his palace returnèd he
and he sat down to supper merrily
and he slept that night like an innocent man
but bishop hatto never slept again
in the morning as he entered the hall
where his picture hung against the wall
a sweat-like death all over him came
for the rats had eaten it out of the frame
as he looked, there came a man from his farm
he had a countenance white with alarm
and the rats had eaten all your corn
another came running presently
and he was pale as pale could be
the lord forgive you yesterday
the walls are high, and the shores are steep
and the stream is strong, and the water deep
bishop hatto fearfully hastened away
and he crossed the rhine without delay
and reached his tower, and barred with care
all windows, doors, and loop-holes there
he laid him down, and closed his eyes
but soon a scream made him arise
he started and saw two eyes of flame
on his pillow, from whence the screaming came
he listened and looked; it was only the cat
but the bishop he grew more fearful for that
for she sat screaming, mad with fear
at the army of rats that was drawing near
for they have swum over the river so deep
and they have climbed the shore so steep
and up the tower their way is bent
to do the work for which they were sent
they are not to be told by the dozen or score
by thousands they come, and by myriads and more
such numbers had never been heard of before
such a judgment had never been witnessed of yore
down on his knees the bishop fell
and faster and faster his beads did tell
as, louder and louder drawing near
the gnawing of their teeth he could hear
and in at the windows and in at the door
and through the walls, helter-skelter they pour
and down from the ceiling and up through the floor
from the right and the left, from behind and before
and all at once to the bishop they go
they have whetted their teeth against the stones
and now they pick the bishop's bones
they gnawed the flesh from every limb
for they were sent to do judgment on him

endurance is the watchword of the poem and the watchword of our
republic. every man to his gun! columbus discovered america in his own
mind before he realised it or proved its existence. i have often drawn
a chart of columbus's life and voyages to show what need he had of the
motto "sail on!" to accomplish his end. this is one of our greatest
american poems. the writer still lives in california
behind him lay the gray azores
behind the gates of hercules
before him not the ghost of shores
before him only shoreless seas
the good mate said: "now must we pray
for lo! the very stars are gone
speak, admiral, what shall i say
my men grow ghastly wan and weak
the stout mate thought of home; a spray
of salt wave wash'd his swarthy cheek
if we sight naught but seas at dawn
they sailed and sailed, as winds might blow
until at last the blanch'd mate said
should i and all my men fall dead
these very winds forget their way
for god from these dread seas is gone
now speak, brave admiral, and say
he said: "sail on! and on
they sailed, they sailed, then spoke his mate
he curls his lip, he lies in wait
with lifted teeth as if to bite
brave admiral, say but one word
what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leaped as a leaping sword
then, pale and worn, he kept his deck
and thro' the darkness peered that night
ah, darkest night! and then a speck
a light! a light! a light! a light
it grew--a star-lit flag unfurled
it grew to be time's burst of dawn
he gained a world! he gave that world
its watch-word: "on! and on
once a year the children learn "the shepherd of king admetus," which is
one of the finest poems ever written as showing the possible growth of
real history into mythology, the tendency of mankind to deify what is
fine or sublime in human action. not every child will learn this entire
poem, because it is too long. but every child will learn the best lines
in it while the children are teaching it to me and when i take my turn
in teaching it to them. no child fails to catch the spirit and intent
of the poem and to become entirely familiar with it. (1819-91
there came a youth upon the earth
some thousand years ago
whose slender hands were nothing worth
whether to plow, or reap, or sow
upon an empty tortoise-shell
he stretched some chords, and drew
music that made men's bosoms swell
fearless, or brimmed their eyes with dew
then king admetus, one who had
pure taste by right divine
decreed his singing not too bad
to hear between the cups of wine
and so, well pleased with being soothed
into a sweet half-sleep
three times his kingly beard he smoothed
and made him viceroy o'er his sheep
his words were simple words enough
and yet he used them so
that what in other mouths was rough
in his seemed musical and low
men called him but a shiftless youth
in whom no good they saw
and yet, unwittingly, in truth
they made his careless words their law
they knew not how he learned at all
for idly, hour by hour
he sat and watched the dead leaves fall
or mused upon a common flower
it seemed the loveliness of things
did teach him all their use
for, in mere weeds, and stones, and springs
he found a healing power profuse
men granted that his speech was wise
but, when a glance they caught
of his slim grace and woman's eyes
they laughed, and called him good-for-naught
yet after he was dead and gone
and e'en his memory dim
earth seemed more sweet to live upon
more full of love, because of him
and day by day more holy grew
each spot where he had trod
till after-poets only knew
their first-born brother as a god
i have an old essay written by a lad of fourteen years on "how they
brought the good news from ghent to aix." i should judge from this
essay that any boy at that age would like the poem, even if he had not
himself been over the ground as this boy had. (1812-89
i sprang to the stirrup, and joris, and he
i galloped, dirck galloped, we galloped all three
behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest
and into the midnight we galloped abreast
not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place
i turned in my saddle and made its girth tight
then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right
rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit
nor galloped less steadily roland a whit
lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear
at boom, a great yellow star came out to see
at düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be
and from mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime
so joris broke silence with, "yet there is time
at aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun
and against him the cattle stood black every one
to stare through the mist at us galloping past
and i saw my stout galloper roland at last
with resolute shoulders, each butting away
the haze, as some bluff river headland its spray
and his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
for my voice, and the other pricked out on his track
and one eye's black intelligence,--ever that glance
o'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance
and the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
his fierce lips shook upward in galloping on
by hasselt, dirck groaned; and cried joris, "stay spur
your roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her
we'll remember at aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze
of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees
and sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank
as down on her haunches she shuddered and sank
past looz and past tongres, no cloud in the sky
the broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh
till over by dalhem a dome-spire sprang white
and "gallop," gasped joris, "for aix is in sight
rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone
and there was my roland to bear the whole weight
of the news which alone could save aix from her fate
with his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim
and with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim
then i cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall
shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all
stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear
called my roland his pet-name, my horse without peer
clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good
till at length into aix roland galloped and stood
and all i remember is--friends flocking round
as i sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground
and no voice but was praising this roland of mine
as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine

education," as has also "the eve of waterloo" and "the death of

not a drum was heard, not a funeral note
as his corse to the rampart we hurried
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried
we buried him darkly at dead of night
the sods with our bayonets turning
by the struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning
no useless coffin enclosed his breast
not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest
with his martial cloak around him
few and short were the prayers we said
and we spoke not a word of sorrow
but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead
and we bitterly thought of the morrow
we thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed
and smoothed down his lonely pillow
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
and we far away on the billow
lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him
but little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him
but half of our heavy task was done
when the clock struck the hour for retiring
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing
slowly and sadly we laid him down
from the field of his fame fresh and gory
we carved not a line, and we raised not a stone
but we left him alone with his glory

only reads it a few times
there was a sound of revelry by night
and belgium's capital had gathered then
her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men
a thousand hearts beat happily; and when
music arose with its voluptuous swell
soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again
and all went merry as a marriage-bell
but hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell
did ye not hear it? no; 'twas but the wind
or the car rattling o'er the stony street
on with the dance! let joy be unconfined
no sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet
to chase the glowing hours with flying feet
but hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more
as if the clouds its echo would repeat
and nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before
arm! arm! it is--it is the cannon's opening roar
ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro
and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress
and cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago
blushed at the praise of their own loveliness
and there were sudden partings, such as press
the life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
if ever more should meet those mutual eyes
since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise
and there was mounting in hot haste: the steed
the mustering squadron, and the clattering car
went pouring forward with impetuous speed
and swiftly forming in the ranks of war
and the deep thunder peal on peal afar
and near, the beat of the alarming drum
roused up the soldier ere the morning star
while thronged the citizens with terror dumb
or whispering with white lips, "the foe! they come! they come
and ardennes waves above them her green leaves
dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass
grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves
over the unreturning brave--alas
ere evening to be trodden like the grass
which, now beneath them, but above shall grow
in its next verdure, when this fiery mass
of living valour, rolling on the foe
and burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low
last noon beheld them full of lusty life
last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay
the midnight brought the signal-sound of strife
the morn the marshalling in arms,--the day
battle's magnificently stern array
the thunder-clouds close o'er it, which, when rent
the earth is covered thick with other clay
which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent

laddie, aged eleven, do you remember how you studied and recited "king
henry of navarre" every poetry hour for a year? it was a long poem, but
you stuck to it to the end. we did not know the meaning of a certain
word, but i found it up in switzerland. it is the name of a little
town. (1800-59
now glory to the lord of hosts, from whom all glories are
and glory to our sovereign liege, king henry of navarre
now let there be the merry sound of music and of dance
through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, o pleasant
land of france
and thou, rochelle, our own rochelle, proud city of the waters
again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters
as thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy
for cold, and stiff, and still are they who wrought thy walls annoy
hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war
hurrah! hurrah! for ivry, and henry of navarre
oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day
we saw the army of the league drawn out in long array
with all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers
and appenzel's stout infantry, and egmont's flemish spears
there rode the brood of false lorraine, the curses of our land
and dark mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand
and, as we looked on them, we thought of seine's empurpled flood
and good coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood
and we cried unto the living god, who rules the fate of war
to fight for his own holy name, and henry of navarre
the king is come to marshal us, in all his armour drest
and he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest
he looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye
he looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high
right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing
down all our line, a deafening shout, "god save our lord the king
for never saw i promise yet of such a bloody fray
press where ye see my white plume shine, amid the ranks of war
and be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of navarre
hurrah! the foes are moving. hark to the mingled din
of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin
the fiery duke is pricking fast across st. andré's plain
with all the hireling chivalry of guelders and almayne
now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of france
charge for the golden lilies,--upon them with the lance
a thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest
a thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest
and in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a guiding star
amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of navarre
now, god be praised, the day is ours. mayenne hath turned his rein
d'aumale hath cried for quarter. the flemish count is slain
their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a biscay gale
the field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail
and then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van
but out spake gentle henry, "no frenchman is my foe
down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go
oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war
as our sovereign lord, king henry, the soldier of navarre
right well fought all the frenchmen who fought for france to-day
and many a lordly banner god gave them for a prey
but we of the religion have borne us best in fight
and the good lord of rosny has ta'en the cornet white
our own true maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en
the cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false lorraine
up with it high; unfurl it wide; that all the host may know
how god hath humbled the proud house which wrought his church such woe

fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for henry of navarre

weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return
ho! philip, send, for charity, thy mexican pistoles
that antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearman's souls
ho! gallant nobles of the league, look that your arms be bright
ho! burghers of saint genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night

king francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport
and one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court
the nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in their pride
and 'mong them sat the count de lorge with one for whom he sighed
and truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show
valour, and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below
ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws
they bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind
went with their paws
with wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another
till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother
the bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air
said francis then, "faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there
de lorge's love o'erheard the king,--a beauteous lively dame
with smiling lips and sharp, bright eyes, which always seem'd the same
she thought, "the count, my lover, is brave as brave can be
he surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me
king, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine
i'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine
she dropped her glove, to prove his love, then look'd
at him and smiled
he bowed, and in a moment leapt among the lions wild
his leap was quick, return was quick, he has regain'd his place
then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face
from where he sat
i found the well of st. keyne in cornwall, england--not the poem, but
the real well. the poem is of the great body of world-lore. southey
a well there is in the west country
and a clearer one never was seen
there is not a wife in the west-country
but has heard of the well of st. keyne
an oak and an elm tree stand beside
and behind does an ash tree grow
and a willow from the bank above
droops to the water below
a traveller came to the well of st. keyne
pleasant it was to his eye
for from cock-crow he had been travelling
and there was not a cloud in the sky
he drank of the water so cool and clear
for thirsty and hot was he
and he sat down upon the bank
under the willow tree
there came a man from the neighbouring town
at the well to fill his pail
on the well-side he rested it
and bade the stranger hail
the happiest draught thou hast drunk this day
that ever thou didst in thy life
in cornwall ever been
for an if she have, i'll venture my life
she has drunk of the well of st. keyne
the stranger he made reply
i pray you answer me why
drank of this crystal well
and before the angel summoned her
she laid on the water a spell
shall drink before his wife
a happy man thenceforth is he
for he shall be master for life
god help the husband then
the stranger stoop'd to the well of st. keyne
and drank of the waters again
he to the countryman said
but the countryman smiled as the stranger spake
and sheepishly shook his head
and left my wife in the porch
but i' faith she had been wiser than me
for she took a bottle to church
twelve-year-old girl who recited it at one of our poetry hours years
never read it without feeling that it stands test. anonymous
the nautilus and the ammonite
were launched in friendly strife
each sent to float in its tiny boat
on the wide, wide sea of life
for each could swim on the ocean's brim
and, when wearied, its sail could furl
and sink to sleep in the great sea-deep
in its palace all of pearl
and theirs was a bliss more fair than this
which we taste in our colder clime
for they were rife in a tropic life
a brighter and better clime
they swam 'mid isles whose summer smiles
were dimmed by no alloy
whose groves were palm, whose air was balm
and life one only joy
they sailed all day through creek and bay
and traversed the ocean deep
and at night they sank on a coral bank
in its fairy bowers to sleep
and the monsters vast of ages past
they beheld in their ocean caves
they saw them ride in their power and pride
and sink in their deep-sea graves
and hand in hand, from strand to strand
they sailed in mirth and glee
these fairy shells, with their crystal cells
twin sisters of the sea
and they came at last to a sea long past
but as they reached its shore
the almighty's breath spoke out in death
and the ammonite was no more
so the nautilus now in its shelly prow
as over the deep it strays
still seems to seek, in bay and creek
its companion of other days
and alike do we, on life's stormy sea
as we roam from shore to shore
thus tempest-tossed, seek the loved, the lost
and find them on earth no more
yet the hope how sweet, again to meet
as we look to a distant strand
where heart meets heart, and no more they part
who meet in that better land
i am monarch of all i survey
my right there is none to dispute
from the center all round to the sea
i am lord of the fowl and the brute
o solitude! where are the charms
that sages have seen in thy face
better dwell in the midst of alarms
than reign in this horrible place
i am out of humanity's reach
i must finish my journey alone
never hear the sweet music of speech
i start at the sound of my own
the beasts that roam over the plain
my form with indifference see
they are so unacquainted with man
their tameness is shocking to me
society, friendship, and love
divinely bestow'd upon man
oh, had i the wings of a dove
how soon would i taste you again
my sorrows i then might assuage
in the ways of religion and truth
might learn from the wisdom of age
and be cheer'd by the sallies of youth
ye winds that have made me your sport
convey to this desolate shore
some cordial endearing report
of a land i shall visit no more
my friends--do they now and then send
a wish or a thought after me
oh, tell me i yet have a friend
though a friend i am never to see
how fleet is a glance of the mind
compared with the speed of its flight
the tempest itself lags behind
and the swift-wingèd arrows of light
when i think of my own native land
in a moment i seem to be there
but alas! recollection at hand
soon hurries me back to despair
but the seafowl is gone to her nest
the beast is laid down in his lair
even here is a season of rest
and i to my cabin repair
there's mercy in every place
and mercy, encouraging thought
gives even affliction a grace
and reconciles man to his lot
i wonder if the english people appreciate "the homes of england." it is
a stately poem worthy of a goethe or a shakespeare. england is
distinctively a country of homes, pretty, little, humble homes as well
as stately palaces and castles, homes well made of stone or brick for
the most part, and clad with ivy and roses. who would not be proud to
have had such a home as ann hathaway's humble cottage or one of the
little huts in the lake district? the homes of america are often more
palatial, especially in small cities, but the use of wood in america
makes them less substantial than the slate-and-brick houses of england
the stately homes of england
how beautiful they stand
amidst their tall ancestral trees
o'er all the pleasant land
the deer across their greensward bound
through shade and sunny gleam
and the swan glides past them with the sound
of some rejoicing stream
the merry homes of england
around their hearths by night
what gladsome looks of household love
meet in the ruddy light
there woman's voice flows forth in song
or childish tale is told
or lips move tunefully along
some glorious page of old
the blessèd homes of england
how softly on their bowers
is laid the holy quietness
that breathes from sabbath hours
solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell's chime
floats through their woods at morn
all other sounds, in that still time
of breeze and leaf are born
the cottage homes of england
by thousands on her plains
they are smiling o'er the silvery brooks
and round the hamlets' fanes
through glowing orchards forth they peep
each from its nook of leaves
and fearless there the lowly sleep
as the bird beneath their eaves
the free, fair homes of england
long, long, in hut and hall
may hearts of native proof be reared
to guard each hallowed wall
and green forever be the groves
and bright the flowery sod
where first the child's glad spirit loves
its country and its god
but i never saw a boy who did not want some stanzas of it. "hold the
bridge with me!" boys like that motto instinctively. t.b. macaulay
lars porsena of clusium
by the nine gods he swore
that the great house of tarquin
should suffer wrong no more
by the nine gods he swore it
and named a trysting-day
and bade his messengers ride forth
east and west and south and north
to summon his array
east and west and south and north
the messengers ride fast
and tower and town and cottage
have heard the trumpet's blast
shame on the false etruscan
who lingers in his home
when porsena of clusium
is on the march for rome
the horsemen and the footmen
are pouring in amain
from many a stately market-place
from many a fruitful plain
from many a lonely hamlet
which, hid by beech and pine
like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest
of purple apennine
the harvests of arretium
this year, old men shall reap
this year, young boys in umbro
shall plunge the struggling sheep
and in the vats of luna
this year, the must shall foam
round the white feet of laughing girls
whose sires have marched to rome
there be thirty chosen prophets
the wisest of the land
who alway by lars porsena
both morn and evening stand
evening and morn the thirty
have turned the verses o'er
traced from the right on linen white
by mighty seers of yore
and with one voice the thirty
have their glad answer given
go forth, beloved of heaven
go, and return in glory
to clusium's royal dome
and hang round nurscia's altars
the golden shields of rome
and now hath every city
sent up her tale of men
the foot are fourscore thousand
the horse are thousands ten
before the gates of sutrium
is met the great array
a proud man was lars porsena
upon the trysting-day
for all the etruscan armies
were ranged beneath his eye
and many a banished roman
and many a stout ally
and with a mighty following
to join the muster came
the tusculan mamilius
prince of the latian name
but by the yellow tiber
was tumult and affright
from all the spacious champaign
to rome men took their flight
a mile around the city
the throng stopped up the ways
a fearful sight it was to see
through two long nights and days
now, from the rock tarpeian
could the wan burghers spy
the line of blazing villages
red in the midnight sky
the fathers of the city
they sat all night and day
for every hour some horseman came
with tidings of dismay
to eastward and to westward
have spread the tuscan bands
nor house, nor fence, nor dovecot
in crustumerium stands
verbenna down to ostia
hath wasted all the plain
astur hath stormed janiculum
and the stout guards are slain
i wis, in all the senate
there was no heart so bold
but sore it ached, and fast it beat
when that ill news was told
forthwith up rose the consul
up rose the fathers all
in haste they girded up their gowns
and hied them to the wall
they held a council standing
before the river gate
short time was there, ye well may guess
for musing or debate
out spoke the consul roundly
for, since janiculum is lost
naught else can save the town
just then a scout came flying
all wild with haste and fear
lars porsena is here
on the low hills to westward
the consul fixed his eye
and saw the swarthy storm of dust
rise fast along the sky
and nearer, fast, and nearer
doth the red whirlwind come
and louder still, and still more loud
from underneath that rolling cloud
is heard the trumpet's war-note proud
the trampling and the hum
and plainly and more plainly
now through the gloom appears
far to left and far to right
in broken gleams of dark-blue light
the long array of helmets bright
the long array of spears
and plainly and more plainly
above the glimmering line
now might ye see the banners
of twelve fair cities shine
but the banner of proud clusium
was the highest of them all
the terror of the umbrian
the terror of the gaul
fast by the royal standard
o'erlooking all the war
lars porsena of clusium
sat in his ivory car
by the right wheel rode mamilius
prince of the latian name
and by the left false sextus
that wrought the deed of shame
but when the face of sextus
was seen among the foes
a yell that rent the firmament
from all the town arose
on the house-tops was no woman
but spat toward him and hissed
no child but screamed out curses
and shook its little fist
but the consul's brow was sad
and the consul's speech was low
and darkly looked he at the wall
and darkly at the foe
before the bridge goes down
and if they once may win the bridge
what hope to save the town
then out spake brave horatius
the captain of the gate
death cometh soon or late
and how can man die better
than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods
who dandled him to rest
and for the wife who nurses
his baby at her breast
and for the holy maidens
who feed the eternal flame
to save them from false sextus
that wrought the deed of shame
with all the speed ye may
i, with two more to help me
will hold the foe in play
in yon straight path a thousand
may well be stopped by three
now who will stand on either hand
and keep the bridge with me
then out spake spurius lartius
a ramnian proud was he
i will stand at thy right hand
and keep the bridge with thee
and out spake strong herminius
of titian blood was he
and keep the bridge with thee
and straight against that great array
forth went the dauntless three
for romans in rome's quarrel
spared neither land nor gold
nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life
in the brave days of old
now while the three were tightening
their harness on their backs
the consul was the foremost man
to take in hand an ax
and fathers mixed with commons
seized hatchet, bar, and crow
and smote upon the planks above
and loosed the props below
meanwhile the tuscan army
right glorious to behold
came flashing back the noonday light
rank behind rank, like surges bright
of a broad sea of gold
four hundred trumpets sounded
a peal of warlike glee
as that great host, with measured tread
and spears advanced, and ensigns spread
rolled slowly toward the bridge's head
where stood the dauntless three
the three stood calm and silent
and looked upon the foes
and a great shout of laughter
from all the vanguard rose
and forth three chiefs came spurring
before that deep array
to earth they sprang, their swords they drew
and lifted high their shields, and flew
to win the narrow way
aunus from green tifernum
lord of the hill of vines
and seius, whose eight hundred slaves
sicken in ilva's mines
and picus, long to clusium
vassal in peace and war
who led to fight his umbrian powers
from that gray crag where, girt with towers
the fortress of nequinum lowers
o'er the pale waves of nar
stout lartius hurled down aunus
into the stream beneath
herminius struck at seius
and clove him to the teeth
at picus brave horatius
darted one fiery thrust
and the proud umbrian's gilded arms
clashed in the bloody dust
then ocnus of falerii
rushed on the roman three
and lausulus of urgo
the rover of the sea
and aruns of volsinium
who slew the great wild boar
the great wild boar that had his den
amid the reeds of cosa's fen
and wasted fields and slaughtered men
along albinia's shore
herminius smote down aruns
lartius laid ocnus low
right to the heart of lausulus
horatius sent a blow
no more, aghast and pale
from ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
the tracks of thy destroying bark
no more campania's hinds shall fly
to woods and caverns when they spy
thy thrice accurséd sail
but now no sound of laughter
was heard among the foes
a wild and wrathful clamour
from all the vanguard rose
six spears' length from the entrance
halted that deep array
and for a space no man came forth
to win the narrow way
but hark! the cry is astur
and lo! the ranks divide
and the great lord of luna
comes with his stately stride
upon his ample shoulders
clangs loud the fourfold shield
and in his hand he shakes the brand
which none but he can wield
he smiled on those bold romans
a smile serene and high
he eyed the flinching tuscans
and scorn was in his eye
quoth he: "the she-wolf's litter
stand savagely at bay
but will ye dare to follow
if astur clears the way
then, whirling up his broadsword
with both hands to the height
he rushed against horatius
and smote with all his might
with shield and blade horatius
right deftly turned the blow
the blow, though turned, came yet too nigh
it missed his helm, but gashed his thigh
the tuscans raised a joyful cry
to see the red blood flow
he reeled, and on herminius
he leaned one breathing space
then, like a wildcat mad with wounds
sprang right at astur's face
through teeth, and skull, and helmet
so fierce a thrust he sped
the good sword stood a handbreadth out
behind the tuscan's head
and the great lord of luna
fell at the deadly stroke
as falls on mount alvernus
a thunder-smitten oak
far o'er the crashing forest
the giant arms lie spread
and the pale augurs, muttering low
gaze on the blasted head
on astur's throat horatius
right firmly pressed his heel
and thrice and four times tugged amain
ere he wrenched out the steel
fair guests, that waits you here
what noble lucumo comes next
to taste our roman cheer
but at his haughty challenge
a sullen murmur ran
mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread
along that glittering van
there lacked not men of prowess
nor men of lordly race
for all etruria's noblest
were round the fatal place
but all etruria's noblest
felt their hearts sink to see
on the earth the bloody corpses
in the path the dauntless three
and, from the ghastly entrance
where those bold romans stood
all shrank, like boys who unaware
ranging the woods to start a hare
come to the mouth of the dark lair
where, growling low, a fierce old bear
lies amid bones and blood
was none who would be foremost
to lead such dire attack
but those behind cried "forward
and those before cried "back
and backward now and forward
wavers the deep array
and on the tossing sea of steel
to and fro the standards reel
and the victorious trumpet peal
dies fitfully away
yet one man for one moment
strode out before the crowd
well known was he to all the three
and they gave him greeting loud
now welcome to thy home
why dost thou stay, and turn away
here lies the road to rome
thrice looked he at the city
thrice looked he at the dead
and thrice came on in fury
and thrice turned back in dread
and, white with fear and hatred
scowled at the narrow way
where, wallowing in a pool of blood
the bravest tuscans lay
but meanwhile ax and lever
have manfully been plied
and now the bridge hangs tottering
above the boiling tide
loud cried the fathers all
back, ere the ruin fall
back darted spurius lartius
herminius darted back
and, as they passed, beneath their feet
they felt the timbers crack
but when they turned their faces
and on the farther shore
saw brave horatius stand alone
they would have crossed once more
but with a crash like thunder
fell every loosened beam
and, like a dam, the mighty wreck
lay right athwart the stream
and a long shout of triumph
rose from the walls of rome
as to the highest turret tops
was splashed the yellow foam
and, like a horse unbroken
when first he feels the rein
the furious river struggled hard
and tossed his tawny mane
and burst the curb, and bounded
rejoicing to be free
and whirling down, in fierce career
battlement, and plank, and pier
rushed headlong to the sea
alone stood brave horatius
but constant still in mind
thrice thirty thousand foes before
and the broad flood behind
with a smile on his pale face
round turned he, as not deigning
those craven ranks to see
naught spake he to lars porsena
to sextus naught spake he
but he saw on palatinus
the white porch of his home
and he spake to the noble river
that rolls by the towers of rome
to whom the romans pray
a roman's life, a roman's arms
take thou in charge this day
so he spake, and speaking sheathed
the good sword by his side
and, with his harness on his back
plunged headlong in the tide
no sound of joy or sorrow
was heard from either bank
but friends and foes in dumb surprise
with parted lips and straining eyes
stood gazing where he sank
and when above the surges
they saw his crest appear
all rome sent forth a rapturous cry
and even the ranks of tuscany
could scarce forbear to cheer
and fiercely ran the current
swollen high by months of rain
and fast his blood was flowing
and he was sore in pain
and heavy with his armour
and spent with changing blows
and oft they thought him sinking
but still again he rose
never, i ween, did swimmer
in such an evil case
struggle through such a raging flood
safe to the landing place
but his limbs were borne up bravely
by the brave heart within
and our good father tiber
bore bravely up his chin
but for this stay, ere close of day
we should have sacked the town
for such a gallant feat of arms
was never seen before
and now he feels the bottom
now on dry earth he stands
now round him throng the fathers
to press his gory hands
and now with shouts and clapping
and noise of weeping loud
he enters through the river gate
borne by the joyous crowd
they gave him of the corn land
that was of public right
as much as two strong oxen
could plow from morn till night
and they made a molten image
and set it up on high
and there it stands unto this day
to witness if i lie
it stands in the comitium
plain for all folk to see
horatius in his harness
halting upon one knee
and underneath is written
in letters all of gold
how valiantly he kept the bridge
in the brave days of old
and still his name sounds stirring
unto the men of rome
as the trumpet blast that cries to them
to charge the volscian home
and wives still pray to juno
for boys with hearts as bold
as his who kept the bridge so well
in the brave days of old
and in the nights of winter
when the cold north winds blow
and the long howling of the wolves
is heard amid the snow
when round the lonely cottage
roars loud the tempest's din
and the good logs of algidus
roar louder yet within
when the oldest cask is opened
and the largest lamp is lit
when the chestnuts glow in the embers
and the kid turns on the spit
when young and old in circle
around the firebrands close
when the girls are weaving baskets
and the lads are shaping bows
when the goodman mends his armour
and trims his helmet's plume
when the goodwife's shuttle merrily
goes flashing through the loom
with weeping and with laughter
still is the story told
how well horatius kept the bridge
in the brave days of old

come, let us plant the apple-tree
cleave the tough greensward with the spade
wide let its hollow bed be made
there gently lay the roots, and there
sift the dark mould with kindly care
and press it o'er them tenderly
as round the sleeping infant's feet
we softly fold the cradle sheet
so plant we the apple-tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
buds, which the breath of summer days
shall lengthen into leafy sprays
boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast
shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest
we plant, upon the sunny lea
a shadow for the noontide hour
a shelter from the summer shower
when we plant the apple-tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
sweets for a hundred flowery springs
to load the may wind's restless wings
when, from the orchard row, he pours
its fragrance through our open doors
a world of blossoms for the bee
flowers for the sick girl's silent room
for the glad infant sprigs of bloom
we plant with the apple-tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
fruits that shall swell in sunny june
and redden in the august noon
and drop, when gentle airs come by
that fan the blue september sky
while children come, with cries of glee
and seek them where the fragrant grass
betrays their bed to those who pass
at the foot of the apple-tree
and when, above this apple-tree
the winter stars are quivering bright
the winds go howling through the night
girls, whose eyes o'erflow with mirth
shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth
and guests in prouder homes shall see
heaped with the grape of cintra's vine
and golden orange of the line
the fruit of the apple-tree
the fruitage of this apple-tree
winds and our flag of stripe and star
shall bear to coasts that lie afar
where men shall wonder at the view
and ask in what fair groves they grew
and sojourners beyond the sea
shall think of childhood's careless day
and long, long hours of summer play
in the shade of the apple-tree
each year shall give this apple-tree
a broader flush of roseate bloom
a deeper maze of verdurous gloom
and loosen, when the frost-clouds lower
the crisp brown leaves in thicker shower
the years shall come and pass, but we
shall hear no longer, where we lie
the summer's songs, the autumn's sigh
in the boughs of the apple-tree
and time shall waste this apple-tree
oh, when its aged branches throw
thin shadows on the ground below
shall fraud and force and iron will
oppress the weak and helpless still
what shall the tasks of mercy be
amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
of those who live when length of years
is wasting this apple-tree
the children of that distant day
thus to some aged man shall say
and, gazing on its mossy stem
the gray-haired man shall answer them
born in the rude but good old times
on planting the apple-tree
on and on
vision of sir launfal." it finds a place in this volume because it is
the most perfect description of a charming day ever written
what is so rare as a day in june
then, if ever, come perfect days
then heaven tries the earth if it be in tune
and over it softly her warm ear lays
whether we look, or whether we listen
we hear life murmur, or see it glisten
every clod feels a stir of might
an instinct within it that reaches and towers
and, groping blindly above it for light
climbs to a soul in grass and flowers
the flush of life may well be seen
thrilling back over hills and valleys
the cowslip startles in meadows green
the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice
and there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
to be some happy creature's palace
the little bird sits at his door in the sun
atilt like a blossom among the leaves
and lets his illumined being o'errun
with the deluge of summer it receives
his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings
and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings
he sings to the wide world, and she to her nest
in the nice ear of nature which song is the best
laid up in heaven. it should be learned for its future value to the
child, not necessarily because the child likes it. its value will dawn
on him
tell me not, in mournful numbers
life is but an empty dream
for the soul is dead that slumbers
and things are not what they seem
life is real! life is earnest
and the grave is not its goal
dust thou art, to dust returnest
was not spoken of the soul
not enjoyment, and not sorrow
is our destined end or way
but to act, that each to-morrow
find us farther than to-day
art is long, and time is fleeting
and our hearts, though stout and brave
still, like muffled drums, are beating
funeral marches to the grave
in the world's broad field of battle
in the bivouac of life
be not like dumb, driven cattle
be a hero in the strife
trust no future, howe'er pleasant
let the dead past bury its dead
act,--act in the living present
heart within, and god o'erhead
lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime
and, departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time
footprints, that perhaps another
sailing o'er life's solemn main
a forlorn and shipwrecked brother
seeing, shall take heart again
let us, then, be up and doing
with a heart for any fate
still achieving, still pursuing
learn to labour and to wait
connection with my lessons on natural history. we have a good specimen
of a barnacle, and the children see them on the shells on the coast
the ethical point is invaluable
my soul is sailing through the sea
but the past is heavy and hindereth me
the past hath crusted cumbrous shells
that hold the flesh of cold sea-mells
about my soul
the huge waves wash, the high waves roll
each barnacle clingeth and worketh dole
and hindereth me from sailing
old past, let go, and drop i' the sea
till fathomless waters cover thee
for i am living, but thou art dead
thou drawest back, i strive ahead
the day to find
thy shells unbind! night comes behind
i needs must hurry with the wind
and trim me best for sailing
how happy is he born and taught
that serveth not another's will
whose armour is his honest thought
and simple truth his utmost skill
whose passions not his master's are
whose soul is still prepared for death
not tied unto the world with care
of public fame, or private breath
reaches into the heart. what is home? a place where we experience
independence, safety, privacy, and where we can dispense hospitality
be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
a charm from the sky seems to hallow us there
which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home
an exile from home, splendour dazzles in vain
o, give me my lowly thatched cottage again
the birds singing gaily, that came at my call
give me them,--and the peace of mind, dearer than all
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home
how sweet 'tis to sit 'neath a fond father's smile
and the cares of a mother to soothe and beguile
let others delight 'mid new pleasures to roam
but give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of home
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home
to thee i'll return, overburdened with care
the heart's dearest solace will smile on me there
no more from that cottage again will i roam
be it ever so humble, there's no place like home
home! home! sweet, sweet home
there's no place like home! there's no place like home
i heard last night a little child go singing
the same words still on notes he went in search
so high for, you concluded the upspringing
of such a nimble bird to sky from perch
must leave the whole bush in a tremble green
and that the heart of italy must beat
while such a voice had leave to rise serene
a little child, too, who not long had been
by mother's finger steadied on his feet
and still _o bella libertà_ he sang
in this collection because i have loved it all my life, and i never
knew any one who could or would offer a criticism upon it. its value
lies in its recognition of childhood's pleasures
woodman, spare that tree
touch not a single bough
in youth it sheltered me
and i'll protect it now
that placed it near his cot
there, woodman, let it stand
thy ax shall harm it not
that old familiar tree
whose glory and renown
are spread o'er land and sea
and wouldst thou hew it down
woodman, forbear thy stroke
cut not its earth-bound ties
oh, spare that agèd oak
now towering to the skies
when but an idle boy
i sought its grateful shade
in all their gushing joy
here, too, my sisters played
my mother kissed me here
my father pressed my hand
forgive this foolish tear
but let that old oak stand
my heart-strings round thee cling
close as thy bark, old friend
here shall the wild-bird sing
and still thy branches bend
old tree! the storm still brave
and, woodman, leave the spot
while i've a hand to save
thy ax shall harm it not
longing for the unchanging and to our love of security
abide with me! fast falls the eventide
the darkness deepens; lord, with me abide
when other helpers fail, and comforts flee
help of the helpless, o abide with me
swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
change and decay in all around i see
o thou who changest not, abide with me

lead, kindly light, amid th' encircling gloom
lead thou me on
the night is dark, and i am far from home
lead thou me on
keep thou my feet; i do not ask to see
the distant scene; one step enough for me
i was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
shouldst lead me on
i loved to choose and see my path; but now
lead thou me on
i loved the garish day; and, spite of fears
pride ruled my will: remember not past years
so long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
will lead me on
o'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
the night is gone
and with the morn those angel faces smile
which i have loved long since, and lost a while
left blooming alone
all her lovely companions
are faded and gone
no flower of her kindred
no rose-bud is nigh
to reflect back her blushes
or give sigh for sigh
i'll not leave thee, thou lone one
to pine on the stem
since the lovely are sleeping
go, sleep thou with them
thus kindly i scatter
thy leaves o'er the bed
where thy mates of the garden
lie scentless and dead
so soon may i follow
when friendships decay
and from love's shining circle
the gems drop away
when true hearts lie withered
and fond ones are flown

we know what master laid thy keel
what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel
who made each mast, and sail, and rope
what anvils rang, what hammers beat
in what a forge and what a heat

and not a rent made by the gale
in spite of rock, and tempest roar
in spite of false lights on the shore

poem, regardless of the fact that every american who can sing it ought
to know it, that he may join in the chorus when patriotic celebrations
call for it. my boys love to repeat the entire poem, but i often find
masses of people trying to sing it, knowing only one stanza. it is our
national anthem, and a part of our education to know every word of it
my country, 'tis of thee

of thee i sing
land where my fathers died
land of the pilgrims' pride

i love thy rocks and rills
thy woods and templed hills

let mortal tongues awake
let all that breathe partake
let rocks their silence break

the breaking waves dashed high
on a stern and rock-bound coast
and the woods against a stormy sky
their giant branches tossed
and the heavy night hung dark
the hills and waters o'er
when a band of exiles moored their bark
on the wild new england shore
not as the conqueror comes
they, the true-hearted, came
not with the roll of the stirring drums
and the trumpet that sings of fame
not as the flying come
in silence and in fear
they shook the depths of the desert gloom
with their hymns of lofty cheer
amid the storm they sang
and the stars heard, and the sea
and the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
to the anthem of the free
the ocean eagle soared
from his nest by the white wave's foam
and the rocking pines of the forest roared
this was their welcome home
there were men with hoary hair
amid that pilgrim band
why had _they_ come to wither there
away from their childhood's land
there was woman's fearless eye
lit by her deep love's truth
there was manhood's brow serenely high
and the fiery heart of youth
what sought they thus afar
bright jewels of the mine
the wealth of seas, the spoils of war
they sought a faith's pure shrine
ay! call it holy ground
the soil where first they trod
they have left unstained what there they found
freedom to worship god
the main idea in "the lotos-eaters" is, are we justified in running

laddie, do you recollect learning this poem after we had read the story

in the afternoon they came unto a land
in which it seemed always afternoon
all round the coast the languid air did swoon
breathing like one that hath a weary dream
full-faced above the valley stood the moon
and like a downward smoke, the slender stream
along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem
a land of streams! some, like a downward smoke
slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go
and some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke
rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below
they saw the gleaming river seaward flow
from the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops
three silent pinnacles of agèd snow
stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops
up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse
the charmèd sunset linger'd low adown
in the red west: thro' mountain clefts the dale
was seen far inland, and the yellow down
border'd with palm, and many a winding vale
and meadow, set with slender galingale
a land where all things always seem'd the same
and round about the keel with faces pale
dark faces pale against that rosy flame
the mild-eyed melancholy lotos-eaters came
branches they bore of that enchanted stem
laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
to each, but whoso did receive of them
and taste, to him the gushing of the wave
far, far away did seem to mourn and rave
on alien shores; and if his fellow spake
his voice was thin, as voices from the grave
and deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake
and music in his ears his beating heart did make
they sat them down upon the yellow sand
between the sun and moon upon the shore
and sweet it was to dream of fatherland
of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore
most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar
weary the wandering fields of barren foam
then some one said, "we will return no more
and all at once they sang, "our island home

presentation of the value of integrity. this poem ranks with "sir
galahad," if not above it. it is a stroke of genius, and every american
ought to be proud of it. every time my boys read "odysseus" or the
story of ulysses with me we read or learn "moly." the plant moly grows
in the united states as well as in europe
traveller, pluck a stem of moly
if thou touch at circe's isle
hermes' moly, growing solely
to undo enchanter's wile
when she proffers thee her chalice
wine and spices mixed with malice
when she smites thee with her staff
to transform thee, do thou laugh
safe thou art if thou but bear
the least leaf of moly rare
close it grows beside her portal
springing from a stock immortal
yes! and often has the witch
sought to tear it from its niche
but to thwart her cruel will
the wise god renews it still
though it grows in soil perverse
heaven hath been its jealous nurse
and a flower of snowy mark
springs from root and sheathing dark
kingly safeguard, only herb
that can brutish passion curb
some do think its name should be
shield-heart, white integrity

if thou touch at circe's isle

to undo enchanter's wile

t'other day as i was twining
roses, for a crown to dine in
what, of all things, 'mid the heap
should i light on, fast asleep
but the little desperate elf
the tiny traitor, love, himself
by the wings i picked him up
like a bee, and in a cup
of my wine i plunged and sank him
then what d'ye think i did?--i drank him
faith, i thought him dead. not he
there he lives with tenfold glee
and now this moment with his wings
i feel him tickling my heart-strings
cupid once upon a bed
of roses laid his weary head
luckless urchin, not to see
within the leaves a slumbering bee
the bee awak'd--with anger wild
the bee awak'd, and stung the child
loud and piteous are his cries
to venus quick he runs, he flies
i die with pain--in sooth i do
stung by some little angry thing
some serpent on a tiny wing
a bee it was--for once, i know
i heard a rustic call it so
thus he spoke, and she the while
heard him with a soothing smile
then said, "my infant, if so much
thou feel the little wild bee's touch
how must the heart, ah, cupid! be
the hapless heart that's stung by thee
cupid and my campasbe played
at cards for kisses. cupid paid
he stakes his quiver, bow and arrows
his mother's doves and team of sparrows
loses them, too; then down he throws
the coral of his lips, the rose
growing on his cheek, but none knows how
with them the crystal of his brow
and then the dimple of his chin
all these did my campasbe win
at last he set her both his eyes
she won and cupid blind did rise
oh, love, hath she done this to thee
what shall, alas, become of me
violo roseboro, one of our good authors, brought to me "a ballad for a
boy," saying: "i believe it is one of the poems that every child ought
to know." it is included in this compilation out of respect to her
opinion and also because the boys to whom i have read it said it was
to settle their own disputes by a hand-to-hand fight, but they will
always help each other when a third party or the elements interfere
humanity is greater than human interests
when george the third was reigning, a hundred years ago
he ordered captain farmer to chase the foreign foe
so cruise about the west of france in the frigate called _quebec
king george the second sent a man called general wolfe, you know
to clamber up a precipice and look into quebec
as you'd look down a hatchway when standing on the deck
before he got inside the town he died, i must allow
but since the town was won for us it is a lucky name
and you'll remember wolfe's good work, and you shall do the same
then farmer said, "i'll try, sir," and farmer bowed so low
that george could see his pigtail tied in a velvet bow
george gave him his commission, and that it might be safer
signed "king of britain, king of france," and sealed it with a wafer
then proud was captain farmer in a frigate of his own
and grander on his quarter-deck than george upon his throne
he'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten
and twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten-score men
and as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs
with two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs
from cape la hogue to ushant, from rochefort to belleisle
she hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel
the fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with melting tar
the lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar
the east wind drives three square-sailed masts from out the breton bay
and "clear for action!" farmer shouts, and reefers yell "hooray
the frenchmen's captain had a name i wish i could pronounce
a breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from bounce
one like those famous fellows who died by guillotine
for honour and the fleur-de-lys, and antoinette the queen
the catholic for louis, the protestant for george
each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths could forge
and both were simple seamen, but both could understand
how each was bound to win or die for flag and native land
the french ship was _la surveillante_, which means the watchful maid
she folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade
her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had to spread more sail
on canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets came like hail
sore smitten were both captains, and many lads beside
and still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners tried
a sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a blazing gun
we could not quench the rushing flames, and so the frenchman won
our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was all aglow
men hung upon the taffrail half scorched, but loth to go
our captain sat where once he stood, and would not quit his chair
he bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him bleeding there
the guns were hushed on either side, the frenchmen lowered boats
they flung us planks and hen-coops, and everything that floats
they risked their lives, good fellows! to bring their rivals aid
twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely made
they had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of brest
and where the waves leapt lower and the riddled ship went slower
in triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to tow her
they dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for farmer dead
and as the wounded captives passed each breton bowed the head
then spoke the french lieutenant, "twas fire that won, not we
you never struck your flag to us; you'll go to england free
twas the sixth day of october, seventeen hundred seventy-nine
a year when nations ventured against us to combine
but thanks be to the french book wherein they're not forgot
now you, if you've to fight the french, my youngster, bear in mind
those seamen of king louis so chivalrous and kind
think of the breton gentlemen who took our lads to brest
and treat some rescued breton as a comrade and a guest
it pure literature and good history
who, with thy hollow breast
still in rude armour drest
comest to daunt me
wrapt not in eastern balms
but with thy fleshless palms
stretched, as if asking alms
why dost thou haunt me
then from those cavernous eyes
pale flashes seemed to rise
as when the northern skies
gleam in december
and, like the water's flow
under december's snow
came a dull voice of woe
from the heart's chamber
my deeds, though manifold
no skald in song has told
no saga taught thee
take heed that in thy verse
thou dost the tale rehearse
else dread a dead man's curse
for this i sought thee
by the wild baltic's strand
i, with my childish hand
tamed the gerfalcon
and, with my skates fast-bound
skimmed the half-frozen sound
that the poor whimpering hound
trembled to walk on
tracked i the grizzly bear
while from my path the hare
fled like a shadow
oft through the forest dark
followed the were-wolf's bark
until the soaring lark
sang from the meadow
joining a corsair's crew
o'er the dark sea i flew
with the marauders
wild was the life we led
many the souls that sped
many the hearts that bled
by our stern orders
wore the long winter out
often our midnight shout
set the cocks crowing
as we the berserk's tale
measured in cups of ale
draining the oaken pail
filled to overflowing
tales of the stormy sea
soft eyes did gaze on me
burning yet tender
and as the white stars shine
on the dark norway pine
on that dark heart of mine
fell their soft splendour
yielding, yet half afraid
and in the forest's shade
our vows were plighted
under its loosened vest
fluttered her little breast
like birds within their nest
by the hawk frighted
shields gleamed upon the wall
loud sang the minstrels all
chanting his glory
when of old hildebrand
i asked his daughter's hand
mute did the minstrels stand
to hear my story
loud then the champion laughed
and as the wind-gusts waft
the sea-foam brightly
so the loud laugh of scorn
out of those lips unshorn
from the deep drinking-horn
blew the foam lightly
i but a viking wild
and though she blushed and smiled
i was discarded
should not the dove so white
follow the sea-mew's flight
why did they leave that night
her nest unguarded
bearing the maid with me
fairest of all was she
among the norsemen
when on the white sea-strand
waving his armed hand
saw we old hildebrand
with twenty horsemen
bent like a reed each mast
yet we were gaining fast
when the wind failed us
and with a sudden flaw
came round the gusty skaw
so that our foe we saw
laugh as he hailed us
round veered the flapping sail
midships with iron keel
struck we her ribs of steel
down her black hulk did reel
through the black water
sails the fierce cormorant
seeking some rocky haunt
with his prey laden
so toward the open main
beating to sea again
through the wild hurricane
bore i the maiden
and when the storm was o'er
cloud-like we saw the shore
stretching to leeward
there for my lady's bower
built i the lofty tower
which to this very hour
stands looking seaward
time dried the maiden's tears
she had forgot her fears
she was a mother
death closed her mild blue eyes
under that tower she lies
ne'er shall the sun arise
on such another
still as a stagnant fen
hateful to me were men
the sunlight hateful
in the vast forest here
clad in my warlike gear
fell i upon my spear
oh, death was grateful
bursting these prison bars
up to its native stars
my soul ascended
there from the flowing bowl
deep drinks the warrior's soul
thus the tale ended
tennyson's (1807-92) "the _revenge_" finds a welcome here because it is
a favourite with teachers of elocution and their audiences. it teaches
us to hold life cheap when the nation's safety is at stake
at flores in the azores sir richard grenville lay
and a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from away
then sware lord thomas howard: "'fore god, i am no coward
but i cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear
and the half my men are sick. i must fly, but follow quick
we are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three
then spake sir richard grenville: "i know you are no coward
you fly them for a moment, to fight with them again
but i've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore
i should count myself the coward if i left them, my lord howard
to these inquisition dogs and the devildoms of spain
so lord howard passed away with five ships of war that day
till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven
but sir richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land
very carefully and slow
men of bideford in devon
and we laid them on the ballast down below
for we brought them all aboard
and they blest him in their pain that they were not left to spain
to the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the lord
he had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight
and he sail'd away from flores till the spaniard came in sight
with his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow
good sir richard, tell us now
for to fight is but to die
and sir richard said again: "we be all good englishmen
let us bang these dogs of seville, the children of the devil
for i never turn'd my back upon don or devil yet
sir richard spoke and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah, and so
the little _revenge_ ran on sheer into the heart of the foe
with her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below
for half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen
and the little _revenge_ ran on thro' the long sea-lane between
thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laugh'd
thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft
running on and on, till delay'd
by their mountain-like _san philip_ that, of fifteen hundred tons
and up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns
took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd
and while now the great _san philip_ hung above us like a cloud
whence the thunderbolt will fall
long and loud
four galleons drew away
from the spanish fleet that day
and two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay
and the battle-thunder broke from them all
but anon the great _san philip_, she bethought herself and went
having that within her womb that had left her ill content
and the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand
for a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers
and a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears
when he leaps from the water to the land
and the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea
but never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three
ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came
ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder
and flame
ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead
and her shame
for some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could
fight us no more
god of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before
for he said, "fight on! fight on
tho' his vessel was all but a wreck
and it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone
with a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck
but a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead
and himself he was wounded again in the side and the head
and he said, "fight on! fight on
and the night went down, and the sun smiled out far
over the summer sea
and the spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring
but they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that
we still could sting
so they watched what the end would be
and we had not fought them in vain
but in perilous plight were we
seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain
and half of the rest of us maim'd for life
in the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife
and the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold
and the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was
all of it spent
and the masts and the rigging were lying over the side
but sir richard cried in his english pride
as may never be fought again
we have won great glory, my men
and a day less or more
at sea or ashore
we die--does it matter when
sink me the ship, master gunner--sink her, split her in twain
fall into the hands of god, not into the hands of spain
and the gunner said. "ay, ay," but the seamen made reply
and the lord hath spared our lives
we will make the spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go
we shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow
and the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe
and the stately spanish men to their flagship bore him then
where they laid him by the mast, old sir richard caught at last
and they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace
but he rose upon their decks, and he cried
i have only done my duty as a man is bound to do
with a joyful spirit i, sir richard grenville, die
and he fell upon their decks, and he died
and they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true
and had holden the power and glory of spain so cheap
that he dared her with one little ship and his english few
was he devil or man? he was devil for aught they knew
but they sank his body with honour down into the deep
and they mann'd the _revenge_ with a swarthier alien crew
and away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own
when a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep
and the water began to heave and the weather to moan
and or ever that evening ended a great gale blew
and a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew
till it smote on their hulls, and their sails, and their masts
and their flags
and the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of spain
and the little _revenge_ herself went down by the island crags
to be lost evermore in the main
sir galahad is the most moral and upright of all the knights of the
round table. the strong lines of the poem (tennyson, 1809-92) are the
strong lines of human destiny
because my heart is pure
my good blade carves the casques of men
my tough lance thrusteth sure
my strength is as the strength of ten
because my heart is pure
the shattering trumpet shrilleth high
the hard brands shiver on the steel
the splintered spear-shafts crack and fly
the horse and rider reel
they reel, they roll in clanging lists
and when the tide of combat stands
perfume and flowers fall in showers
that lightly rain from ladies' hands
how sweet are looks that ladies bend
on whom their favours fall
for them i battle till the end
to save from shame and thrall
but all my heart is drawn above
my knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine
i never felt the kiss of love
nor maiden's hand in mine
more bounteous aspects on me beam
me mightier transports move and thrill
so keep i fair thro' faith and prayer
a virgin heart in work and will
when down the stormy crescent goes
a light before me swims
between dark stems the forest glows
i hear a noise of hymns
then by some secret shrine i ride
i hear a voice, but none are there
the stalls are void, the doors are wide
the tapers burning fair
fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth
the silver vessels sparkle clean
the shrill bell rings, the censer swings
and solemn chaunts resound between
sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
i find a magic bark
i leap on board: no helmsman steers
i float till all is dark
a gentle sound, an awful light
three angels bear the holy grail
with folded feet, in stoles of white
on sleeping wings they sail
ah, blessèd vision! blood of god
my spirit beats her mortal bars
as down dark tides the glory slides
and star-like mingles with the stars
when on my goodly charger borne
thro' dreaming towns i go
the cock crows ere the christmas morn
the streets are dumb with snow
the tempest crackles on the leads
and, ringing, springs from brand and mail
but o'er the dark a glory spreads
and gilds the driving hail
i leave the plain, i climb the height
no branchy thicket shelter yields
but blessèd forms in whistling storms
fly o'er waste fens and windy fields
a maiden knight--to me is given
such hope, i know not fear
i yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
that often meet me here
i muse on joy that will not cease
pure spaces cloth'd in living beams
pure lilies of eternal peace
whose odours haunt my dreams
and, stricken by an angel's hand
this mortal armour that i wear
this weight and size, this heart and eyes
are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air
the clouds are broken in the sky
and thro' the mountain-walls
a rolling organ-harmony
swells up, and shakes and falls
then move the trees, the copses nod
wings flutter, voices hover clear
ride on! the prize is near
so pass i hostel, hall, and grange
by bridge and ford, by park and pale
all-arm'd i ride, whate'er betide
until i find the holy grail
correct our ready overestimate of our own importance
alone i walked the ocean strand
a pearly shell was in my hand
i stooped and wrote upon the sand
my name--the year--the day
as onward from the spot i passed
one lingering look behind i cast
a wave came rolling high and fast
and washed my lines away
and so, methought, 'twill shortly be
with every mark on earth from me
a wave of dark oblivion's sea
will sweep across the place
where i have trod the sandy shore
of time, and been, to be no more
of me--my day--the name i bore
to leave nor track nor trace
and yet, with him who counts the sands
and holds the waters in his hands
i know a lasting record stands
inscribed against my name
of all this mortal part has wrought
of all this thinking soul has thought
and from these fleeting moments caught
for glory or for shame
the best is yet to be
the last of life, for which the first was made
attractive as years go on. the line in this poem that captivated my
youthful fancy was
the delight with which trees hang out their new little tassels every
year is one of the charms of "the pine family." john burroughs sent us
down a tiny hemlock, that grew in our window-box at school for five
years, and every spring it was a new joy on account of the fine, tender
tassels. mrs. hemans had a vivid imagination backed up by an abundant
information
i come, i come! ye have called me long
i come o'er the mountains, with light and song
ye may trace my step o'er the waking earth
by the winds which tell of the violet's birth
by the primrose stars in the shadowy grass
by the green leaves opening as i pass
i have breathed on the south, and the chestnut-flowers
by thousands have burst from the forest bowers
and the ancient graves and the fallen fanes
are veiled with wreaths on italian plains
but it is not for me, in my hour of bloom
to speak of the ruin or the tomb
i have looked o'er the hills of the stormy north
and the larch has hung all his tassels forth
the fisher is out on the sunny sea
and the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free
and the pine has a fringe of softer green
and the moss looks bright, where my step has been
i have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh
and called out each voice of the deep blue sky
from the night-bird's lay through the starry time
in the groves of the soft hesperian clime
to the swan's wild note by the iceland lakes
when the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks
from the streams and founts i have loosed the chain
they are sweeping on to the silvery main
they are flashing down from the mountain brows
they are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs
they are bursting fresh from their sparry caves
and the earth resounds with the joy of waves
not expect children to appreciate fully, even when they care enough for
it to learn it. it is too long for most children to commit to memory
and i generally assign one stanza to one pupil and another to another
pupil until it is divided up among them. the poem is a masterpiece
doubtless the poet meant to show that the forsaken merman had a greater
soul to save than the woman who sought to save her soul by deserting
natural duty. salvation does not come through the faith that builds
itself at the expense of love
come, dear children, let us away
down and away below
now my brothers call from the bay
now the great winds shoreward blow
now the salt tides seaward flow
now the wild white horses play
champ and chafe and toss in the spray
children dear, let us away
this way, this way
call her once before you go
call once yet
in a voice that she will know
children's voices should be dear
children's voices, wild with pain
surely she will come again
call her once and come away
this way, this way
the wild white horses foam and fret
margaret! margaret
come, dear children, come away down
call no more
one last look at the white-wall'd town
and the little gray church on the windy shore
then come down
she will not come though you call all day
come away, come away
children dear, was it yesterday
we heard the sweet bells over the bay
in the caverns where we lay
through the surf and through the swell
the far-off sound of a silver bell
sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep
where the winds are all asleep
where the spent lights quiver and gleam
where the salt weed sways in the stream
where the sea-beasts, ranged all round
feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground
where the sea-snakes coil and twine
dry their mail and bask in the brine
where great whales come sailing by
sail and sail, with unshut eye
round the world forever and aye
when did music come this way
children dear, was it yesterday
children dear, was it yesterday
once she sate with you and me
on a red gold throne in the heart of the sea
and the youngest sate on her knee
she comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well
when down swung the sound of a far-off bell
she sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea
she said: "i must go, for my kinsfolk pray
in the little gray church on the shore to-day
and i lose my poor soul, merman! here with thee
i said: "go up, dear heart, through the waves
say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves
she smil'd, she went up through the surf in the bay
children dear, was it yesterday
children dear, were we long alone
long prayers," i said, "in the world they say
come!" i said; and we rose through the surf in the bay
we went up the beach, by the sandy down
where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town
through the narrow pav'd streets, where all was still
to the little gray church on the windy hill
from the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers
but we stood without in the cold blowing airs
we climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains
and we gaz'd up the aisle through the small leaded panes
she sate by the pillar; we saw her clear
dear heart," i said, "we are long alone
the sea grows stormy, the little ones moan
but, ah, she gave me never a look
for her eyes were seal'd to the holy book
loud prays the priest: shut stands the door
come away, children, call no more
come away, come down, call no more
down, down, down
down to the depths of the sea
she sits at her wheel in the humming town
singing most joyfully
hark what she sings: "o joy, o joy
for the humming street, and the child with its toy
for the priest, and the bell, and the holy well
for the wheel where i spun
and the blessèd light of the sun
and so she sings her fill
singing most joyfully
till the spindle drops from her hand
and the whizzing wheel stands still
she steals to the window, and looks at the sand
and over the sand at the sea
and her eyes are set in a stare
and anon there breaks a sigh
and anon there drops a tear
from a sorrow-clouded eye
and a heart sorrow-laden
a long, long sigh
for the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden
and the gleam of her golden hair
come away, away, children
come, children, come down
the hoarse wind blows colder
lights shine in the town
she will start from her slumber
when gusts shake the door
she will hear the winds howling
will hear the waves roar
we shall see, while above us
the waves roar and whirl
a ceiling of amber
a pavement of pearl
singing: "here came a mortal
but faithless was she
and alone dwell forever
the kings of the sea
but, children, at midnight
when soft the winds blow
when clear falls the moonlight
when spring-tides are low
when sweet airs come seaward
from heaths starr'd with broom
and high rocks throw mildly
on the blanch'd sands a gloom
up the still, glistening beaches
up the creeks we will hie
over banks of bright seaweed
the ebb-tide leaves dry
we will gaze, from the sand-hills
at the white, sleeping town
at the church on the hill-side
and then come back down
singing: "there dwells a lov'd one
but cruel is she
she left lonely forever
the kings of the sea
southwestern part of scotland. robert burns's old home it close to it
the house has low walls, a thatched roof, and only two rooms. alloway
kirk and the two bridges so famous in robert burns's verse are near by
this is an enchanted land, and the scotch people for miles around ayr
speak of the poet with sincere affection. burns, more than any other
poet, has thrown the enchantment of poetry over his own locality
ye banks and braes o' bonnie doon
how can ye blume sae fair
how can ye chant, ye little birds
and i sae fu' o' care
thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird
that sings upon the bough
thou minds me o' the happy days
when my fause luve was true
thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird
that sings beside thy mate
for sae i sat, and sae i sang
and wist na o' my fate
aft hae i rov'd by bonnie doon
to see the woodbine twine
and ilka bird sang o' its love
and sae did i o' mine
wi' lightsome heart i pu'd a rose
frae off its thorny tree
and my fause luver staw the rose
but left the thorn wi' me
oft in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
fond memory brings the light
of other days around me
the smiles, the tears
of boyhood's years
the words of love then spoken
the eyes that shone
now dimmed and gone
the cheerful hearts now broken
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me
when i remember all
the friends so link'd together
i've seen around me fall
like leaves in wintry weather
i feel like one
who treads alone
some banquet-hall deserted
whose lights are fled
whose garlands dead
and all but he departed
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me
if john burroughs (1837-) had never written any other poem than "my own
shall come to me," he would have stood to all ages as one of the
greatest of american poets. the poem is most characteristic of the
tall, majestic, slow-going poet and naturalist. there is no greater
line in greek or english literature than
serene i fold my hands and wait
nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea
i rave no more 'gainst time or fate
for lo! my own shall come to me
i stay my haste, i make delays
for what avails this eager pace
i stand amid the eternal ways
and what is mine shall know my face
asleep, awake, by night or day
the friends i seek are seeking me
no wind can drive my bark astray
nor change the tide of destiny
what matter if i stand alone
i wait with joy the coming years
my heart shall reap when it has sown
and gather up its fruit of tears
the stars come nightly to the sky
the tidal wave comes to the sea
nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high
can keep my own away from me
the waters know their own and draw
the brook that springs in yonder heights
so flows the good with equal law
unto the soul of pure delights
assigned to "grammar grades" of schools. it is included here out of
respect to a boy of eleven years who was more impressed with these
lines than with any other lines in any poem
in the light of thought
singing songs unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not
hail to thee, blithe spirit
bird thou never wert
that from heaven or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art
higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest
in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are brightening
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun
the pale purple even
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen, but yet i hear thy shrill delight
all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud
as, when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed
what thou art we know not
what is most like thee
from rainbow-clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody
like a poet hidden
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not
teach us, sprite or bird
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine
chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chaunt
matched with thine, would be all
but an empty vaunt
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want
what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain
what fields, or waves, or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain
teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then, as i am listening now
i have often had the pleasure of riding across the coast from chester
england, to rhyl, on the north coast of wales, where stretch "the sands
of dee" (charles kingsley, 1819-75). these purple sands at low tide
stretch off into the sea miles away, and are said to be full of
quicksands
and call the cattle home
and call the cattle home
across the sands of dee
the western wind was wild and dark with foam
and all alone went she
the western tide crept up along the sand
and o'er and o'er the sand
and round and round the sand
as far as eye could see
the rolling mist came down and hid the land
and never home came she
oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair
a tress of golden hair
a drownèd maiden's hair
above the nets at sea
was never salmon yet that shone so fair
among the stakes on dee
they rowed her in across the rolling foam
the cruel crawling foam
the cruel hungry foam
to her grave beside the sea
but still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home
across the sands of dee
1770-1850) are two gems that can be valued only for the spirit of quiet
and modesty diffused by them
mine be a cot beside the hill
a bee-hive's hum shall soothe my ear
a willowy brook that turns a mill
with many a fall shall linger near
the swallow, oft, beneath my thatch
shall twitter from her clay-built nest
oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch
and share my meal, a welcome guest
around my ivied porch shall spring
each fragrant flower that drinks the dew
and lucy, at her wheel, shall sing
in russet gown and apron blue
the village church among the trees
where first our marriage-vows were given
with merry peals shall swell the breeze
and point with taper spire to heaven
she dwelt among the untrodden ways
beside the springs of dove
a maid whom there were none to praise
and very few to love
a violet by a mossy stone
half-hidden from the eye
fair as a star, when only one
is shining in the sky
she lived unknown, and few could know
when lucy ceased to be
but she is in her grave, and, oh
the difference to me
happy the man, whose wish and care
a few paternal acres bound
content to breathe his native air
in his own ground
whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread
whose flocks supply him with attire
whose trees in summer yield him shade
in winter fire
blest, who can unconcern'dly find
hours, days, and years slide soft away
in health of body, peace of mind
quiet by day
sound sleep by night; study and ease
together mixt, sweet recreation
and innocence, which most does please
with meditation
thus let me live, unseen, unknown
thus unlamented let me die
steal from the world, and not a stone
tell where i lie
please several teachers

this sonnet the poetess has touched the power of wordsworth or keats
and placed herself among the immortals
the god of music dwelleth out of doors
all seasons through his minstrelsy we meet
breathing by field and covert haunting-sweet
from organ-lofts in forests old he pours
a solemn harmony: on leafy floors
to smooth autumnal pipes he moves his feet
or with the tingling plectrum of the sleet
in winter keen beats out his thrilling scores
leave me the reed unplucked beside the stream
and he will stoop and fill it with the breeze
leave me the viol's frame in secret trees
unwrought, and it shall wake a druid theme
leave me the whispering shell on nereid shores
the god of music dwelleth out of doors
poem is the supreme masterpiece of mrs. browning. the prime thought in
it is the sacrifice and pain that must go to make a poet of any genius
what was he doing, the great god pan
down in the reeds by the river
spreading ruin and scattering ban
splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat
and breaking the golden lilies afloat
with the dragon-fly on the river
he tore out a reed, the great god pan
from the deep cool bed of the river
the limpid water turbidly ran
and the broken lilies a-dying lay
and the dragon-fly had fled away
ere he brought it out of the river
high on the shore sat the great god pan
while turbidly flow'd the river
and hack'd and hew'd as a great god can
with his hard bleak steel at the patient reed
till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed
to prove it fresh from the river
he cut it short, did the great god pan
then drew the pith, like the heart of a man
steadily from the outside ring
and notched the poor dry empty thing
in holes, as he sat by the river
to make sweet music, they could succeed
then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed
he blew in power by the river
sweet, sweet, sweet, o pan
piercing sweet by the river
blinding sweet, o great god pan
the sun on the hill forgot to die
and the lilies reviv'd, and the dragon-fly
came back to dream on the river
yet half a beast is the great god pan
to laugh as he sits by the river
making a poet out of a man
the true gods sigh for the cost and pain
for the reed which grows nevermore again
as a reed with the reeds in the river
dramatic, and the music of the refrain has done much to make it
popular. but the pathos is that which endears it
the old mayor climb'd the belfry tower
the ringers ran by two, by three
good ringers, pull your best," quoth he
ply all your changes, all your swells

men say it was a stolen tyde
the lord that sent it, he knows all
but in myne ears doth still abide
the message that the bells let fall
and there was naught of strange, beside
the flight of mews and peewits pied

my thread brake off, i raised myne eyes
the level sun, like ruddy ore
lay sinking in the barren skies
and dark against day's golden death
she moved where lindis wandereth
my sonne's faire wife, elizabeth
ere the early dews were falling
farre away i heard her song
where the reedy lindis floweth
floweth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
faintly came her milking song
leave your meadow grasses mellow
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe, whitefoot, come uppe, lightfoot
quit the stalks of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe, jetty, rise and follow
from the clovers lift your head
come uppe, whitefoot, come uppe, lightfoot
come uppe, jetty, rise and follow
jetty, to the milking shed
if it be long ay, long ago
when i beginne to think howe long
againe i hear the lindis flow
swift as an arrowe, sharpe and strong
and all the aire, it seemeth mee
bin full of floating bells (sayth shee
that ring the tune of enderby
alle fresh the level pasture lay
and not a shadowe mote be seene
save where full fyve good miles away
the steeple tower'd from out the greene
and lo! the great bell farre and wide
was heard in all the country side
that saturday at eventide
the swanherds where their sedges are
mov'd on in sunset's golden breath
the shepherde lads i heard afarre
and my sonne's wife, elizabeth
till floating o'er the grassy sea
came downe that kyndly message free
the "brides of mavis enderby
then some look'd uppe into the sky
and all along where lindis flows
to where the goodly vessels lie
and where the lordly steeple shows
they sayde, "and why should this thing be
what danger lowers by land or sea
they ring the tune of enderby
of pyrate galleys warping down
for shippes ashore beyond the scorpe
they have not spar'd to wake the towne
but while the west bin red to see
and storms be none, and pyrates flee
why ring 'the brides of enderby
i look'd without, and lo! my sonne
came riding downe with might and main
he rais'd a shout as he drew on
till all the welkin rang again
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth
the rising tide comes on apace
and boats adrift in yonder towne
go sailing uppe the market-place
he shook as one that looks on death
with her two bairns i marked her long
and ere yon bells beganne to play
afar i heard her milking song
he looked across the grassy lea
to right, to left, "ho, enderby
they rang "the brides of enderby
with that he cried and beat his breast
for, lo! along the river's bed
a mighty eygre rear'd his crest
and uppe the lindis raging sped
it swept with thunderous noises loud
shap'd like a curling snow-white cloud
or like a demon in a shroud
and rearing lindis backward press'd
shook all her trembling bankes amaine
then madly at the eygre's breast
flung uppe her weltering walls again
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout
then beaten foam flew round about
then all the mighty floods were out
so farre, so fast the eygre drave
the heart had hardly time to beat
before a shallow seething wave
sobb'd in the grasses at oure feet
the feet had hardly time to flee
before it brake against the knee
and all the world was in the sea
upon the roofe we sate that night
the noise of bells went sweeping by
i mark'd the lofty beacon light
stream from the church tower, red and high
a lurid mark and dread to see
and awsome bells they were to mee
that in the dark rang "enderby
they rang the sailor lads to guide
from roofe to roofe who fearless row'd
and i--my sonne was at my side
and yet the ruddy beacon glow'd
and yet he moan'd beneath his breath
o lost! my love, elizabeth
and didst thou visit him no more
thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare
the waters laid thee at his doore
ere yet the early dawn was clear
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace
the lifted sun shone on thy face
downe drifted to thy dwelling-place
that flow strew'd wrecks about the grass
that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea
a fatal ebbe and flow, alas
to manye more than myne and mee
but each will mourn his own (she saith
and sweeter woman ne'er drew breath
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth
i shall never hear her more
by the reedy lindis shore
ere the early dews be falling
i shall never hear her song
where the sunny lindis floweth
goeth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
when the water winding down
onward floweth to the town
i shall never see her more
where the reeds and rushes quiver
shiver, quiver
stand beside the sobbing river
sobbing, throbbing, in its falling
to the sandy lonesome shore
i shall never hear her calling
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
quit your pipes of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe, lightfoot, rise and follow
lightfoot, whitefoot
from your clovers lift the head

and most appealing poems a teacher can read to her pupils when teaching
early american history. the poem is full of magnificent lines, such as
audience of young people when correlated with the study of north
carolina and sir walter raleigh. the solitary, majestic character of
sir walter raleigh, his intrepidity while undergoing tortures inflicted
by a cowardly king, the ring of indignation--- all these make a weapon
for him stronger than the ax that beheaded him. in this poem he "has

goe, soule, the bodie's guest
upon a thanklesse arrant

goe, since i needs must dye
and give the world the lye
goe tell the court it glowes
and shines like rotten wood
goe tell the church it showes
what's good, and doth no good
if church and court reply
then give them both the lye
tell potentates they live
acting by others' actions
not loved unlesse they give
not strong but by their factions
if potentates reply
give potentates the lye
tell men of high condition
that rule affairs of state
their purpose is ambition
their practice only hate
and if they once reply
then give them all the lye
tell zeale it lacks devotion
tell love it is but lust
tell time it is but motion
tell flesh it is but dust
and wish them not reply
for thou must give the lye
tell wit how much it wrangles
in tickle points of nicenesse
tell wisdome she entangles
herselfe in over-wisenesse
and if they do reply
straight give them both the lye
tell physicke of her boldnesse
tell skill it is pretension
tell charity of coldnesse
tell law it is contention
and as they yield reply
so give them still the lye
tell fortune of her blindnesse
tell nature of decay
tell friendship of unkindnesse
tell justice of delay
and if they dare reply
then give them all the lye
tell arts they have no soundnesse
but vary by esteeming
tell schooles they want profoundnesse
and stand too much on seeming
if arts and schooles reply
give arts and schooles the lye
commanded thee, done blabbing
although to give the lye
deserves no less than stabbing
yet stab at thee who will

we shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down
for an æon or two
till the master of all good workmen shall set us to work anew
and those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit
in a golden chair
they shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair
they shall find real saints to draw from--magdalene, peter, and paul
they shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all
and only the master shall praise us, and only the master shall blame
and no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame
but each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star
shall draw the thing as he sees it for the god of things as they are
comfort and control people who are shut up to the joys of
meditation--people to whom the world of activity is closed. to be
independent of things material--this is the soul's pleasure
my mind to me a kingdom is
such perfect joy therein i find
as far excels all earthly bliss
that god or nature hath assigned
though much i want that most would have
yet still my mind forbids to crave
content i live; this is my stay
i seek no more than may suffice
i press to bear no haughty sway
look, what i lack my mind supplies
lo, thus i triumph like a king
content with that my mind doth bring
i laugh not at another's loss
i grudge not at another's gain
no worldly wave my mind can toss
i brook that is another's bane
i fear no foe, nor fawn on friend
i loathe not life, nor dread mine end
my wealth is health and perfect ease
my conscience clear my chief defense
i never seek by bribes to please
nor by desert to give offense
thus do i live, thus will i die
the harp that once through tara's halls
the soul of music shed
now hangs as mute on tara's walls
as if that soul were fled
so sleeps the pride of former days
so glory's thrill is o'er
and hearts, that once beat high for praise
now feel that pulse no more
no more to chiefs and ladies bright
the harp of tara swells
the chord alone, that breaks at night
its tale of ruin tells
thus freedom now so seldom wakes
the only throb she gives
is when some heart indignant breaks
to show that still she lives
love because it is an elegant expression of something very dear and
homely
how dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood
when fond recollection presents them to view
the orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood
and every loved spot which my infancy knew
the wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it
the bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell
the cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it
and e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket which hung in the well
that moss-covered vessel i hailed as a treasure
for often at noon, when returned from the field
i found it the source of an exquisite pleasure
the purest and sweetest that nature can yield
how ardent i seized it, with hands that were glowing
and quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell
then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing
and dripping with coolness, it rose from the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket arose from the well
how sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it
as poised on the curb it inclined to my lips
not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it
the brightest that beauty or revelry sips
and now, far removed from the loved habitation
the tear of regret will intrusively swell
as fancy reverts to my father's plantation
and sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well
the old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well
many college men speak of it at once as the great poem of their
boyhood. the poem caught me when a child by its refrain and weird
picturesqueness. it has never outgrown its mechanical charm
once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
only this, and nothing more
ah! distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow; vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore
and the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is, and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
but the fact is, i was napping, and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard you." here i opened wide the door
darkness there, and nothing more
deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there, wondering
fearing
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "lenore
merely this, and nothing more
back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
soon again i heard a rapping, something louder than before
let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore
open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter
in there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he
but with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
perched above a bust of pallas, just above my chamber door
perched, and sat, and nothing more
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
sure, no craven
ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore
quoth the raven, "nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
though its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
with such a name as "nevermore
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered
till i scarcely more than muttered--"other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said, "nevermore
startled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore
of 'never, nevermore
but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and
bust, and door
then upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking
fancy into fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking "nevermore
thus i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
on the cushion's velvet lining, that the lamp-light gloated o'er
but whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er
she shall press, ah, nevermore
then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim, whose footfalls twinkled on the tufted floor
hath sent thee
respite--respite and nepenthe from my memories of lenore
quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven, "nevermore
whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, i implore
is there--_is_ there balm in gilead?--tell me, tell me, i implore
quoth the raven, "nevermore
by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore
tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant aiden
it shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, "nevermore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, "nevermore
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas, just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
and the lamp-light o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted--nevermore
make way for liberty, and died
in arms the austrian phalanx stood
a living wall, a human wood
a wall, where every conscious stone
seemed to its kindred thousands grown
a rampart all assaults to bear
till time to dust their frames should wear
so still, so dense the austrians stood
a living wall, a human wood
impregnable their front appears
all horrent with projected spears
whose polished points before them shine
from flank to flank, one brilliant line
bright as the breakers' splendours run
along the billows to the sun
opposed to these a hovering band
contended for their fatherland
peasants, whose new-found strength had broke
from manly necks the ignoble yoke
and beat their fetters into swords
on equal terms to fight their lords
and what insurgent rage had gained
in many a mortal fray maintained
marshalled, once more, at freedom's call
they came to conquer or to fall
where he who conquered, he who fell
was deemed a dead or living tell
such virtue had that patriot breathed
so to the soil his soul bequeathed
that wheresoe'er his arrows flew
heroes in his own likeness grew
and warriors sprang from every sod
which his awakening footstep trod
and now the work of life and death
hung on the passing of a breath
the fire of conflict burned within
the battle trembled to begin
yet, while the austrians held their ground
point for attack was nowhere found
where'er the impatient switzers gazed
the unbroken line of lances blazed
that line 'twere suicide to meet
and perish at their tyrant's feet
how could they rest within their graves
and leave their homes, the homes of slaves
would not they feel their children tread
with clanging chains, above their head
it must not be; this day, this hour
annihilates the invader's power
all switzerland is in the field
she will not fly,--she cannot yield
she must not fall; her better fate
here gives her an immortal date
few were the numbers she could boast
but every freeman was a host
and felt as 'twere a secret known
that one should turn the scale alone
while each unto himself was he
on whose sole arm hung victory
it did depend on one indeed
behold him,--arnold winkelried
there sounds not to the trump of fame
the echo of a nobler name
unmarked he stood amid the throng
in rumination deep and long
till you might see, with sudden grace
the very thought come o'er his face
and, by the motion of his form
anticipate the bursting storm
and, by the uplifting of his brow
tell where the bolt would strike, and how
but 'twas no sooner thought than done
the field was in a moment won
then ran, with arms extended wide
as if his dearest friend to clasp
ten spears he swept within his grasp
their keen points crossed from side to side
he bowed amidst them like a tree
and thus made way for liberty
swift to the breach his comrades fly
and through the austrian phalanx dart
as rushed the spears through arnold's heart
while instantaneous as his fall
rout, ruin, panic, seized them all
an earthquake could not overthrow
a city with a surer blow
thus switzerland again was free
thus death made way for liberty
life! i know not what thou art
but know that thou and i must part
and when, or how, or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet
life! we've been long together
through pleasant and through cloudy weather
tis hard to part when friends are dear
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear
choose thine own time
say not good night,--but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning

the quality of mercy is not strain'd
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd
it blesseth him that gives, and him that takes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his scepter shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
but mercy is above his sceptered sway
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to god himself
and earthly power doth then show likest god's
when mercy seasons justice

o, may i join the choir invisible
of those immortal dead who live again
in minds made better by their presence; live
in pulses stirred to generosity
in deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn

in thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars
and with their mild persistence urge men's minds
to vaster issues

enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love
beget the smiles that have no cruelty
be the sweet presence of good diffused
and in diffusion ever more intense
so shall i join the choir invisible
whose music is the gladness of the world
the greatest sonnet ever written. it is true that "the eyes of the
soul" are blinded by a surfeit of worldly "goods." "i went to the lake
district" (england), said john burroughs, "to see what kind of a
country could produce a wordsworth." of course he found simple houses
simple people, barren moors, heather-clad mountains, wild flowers, calm
lakes, plain, rugged simplicity
the world is too much with us; late and soon
getting and spending, we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away, a sordid boon
this sea, that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this, for everything, we are out of tune
it moves us not. great god! i'd rather be
a pagan, suckled in a creed outworn
so might i, standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
have sight of proteus, rising from the sea
or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn
stately and pathetic sonnet in existence. the soul enduring enforced
idleness and loss of power without repining. inactivity made to serve a
higher end
there is no first or last
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days, in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bent
to serve therewith my maker, and present
my true account, lest he, returning, chide
doth god exact day-labour, light denied
i fondly ask: but patience, to prevent
that murmur, soon replies, god doth not need
either man's work, or his own gifts; who best
bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state
is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest
they also serve who only stand and wait
included here because it is a picture of woman as she should be, not
made dainty by finery, but by fine ideals
for human nature's daily food
she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamed upon my sight
a lovely apparition, sent
to be a moment's ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilight's, too, her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn
a dancing shape, an image gay
to haunt, to startle, and waylay
i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit, yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records, promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food
for transient sorrows, simple wiles
praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles
and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveller between life and death
the reason firm, the temperate will
endurance, foresight, strength, and skill
a perfect woman, nobly planned
to warn, to comfort, and command
and yet a spirit still, and bright
with something of angelic light
from windsor castle through eton, down the long hedge-bound road which
passes the estate of william penn's descendants to stoke pogis, the
little churchyard where this poem was written. they were trimming a
great yew-tree under which gray was said to have written this poem. the
scene is one of peace and quiet. the "elegy" was a favourite form of
poem with the ancients, but gray is said to have reached the climax
among poets in this style of verse. the great line of the poem is
it would almost seem that poetry has for its greatest mission the
lesson of a proper humility
the curfew tolls the knell of parting day
the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea
the plowman homeward plods his weary way
and leaves the world to darkness and to me
now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight
and all the air a solemn stillness holds
save where the beetle wheels his droning flight
and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds
save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
the moping owl does to the moon complain
of such as, wandering near her secret bow'r
molest her ancient solitary reign
beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade
where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap
each in his narrow cell forever laid
the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep
the breezy call of incense-breathing morn
the swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed
the cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn
no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed
for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn
or busy housewife ply her evening care
no children run to lisp their sire's return
or climb his knees the envied kiss to share
oft did the harvest to their sickle yield
their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke
how jocund did they drive their team afield
how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke
let not ambition mock their useful toil
their homely joys, and destiny obscure
nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
the short and simple annals of the poor
the boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r
and all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave
await alike th' inevitable hour
the paths of glory lead but to the grave
forgive, ye proud, th' involuntary fault
if memory to these no trophies raise
where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
the pealing anthem swells the note of praise
can storied urn or animated bust
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath
can honour's voice provoke the silent dust
or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death
perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
some heart once pregnant with celestial fire
hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd
or waked to ecstasy the living lyre
but knowledge to their eyes her ample page
rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll
chill penury repress'd their noble rage
and froze the genial current of the soul
full many a gem of purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness on the desert air
some village-hampden, that with dauntless breast
the little tyrant of his fields withstood
some mute inglorious milton here may rest
some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood
th' applause of listening senates to command
the threats of pain and ruin to despise
to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land
and read their history in a nation's eyes
their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone
their growing virtues, but their crimes confined
forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne
and shut the gates of mercy on mankind
the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide
to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame
or heap the shrine of luxury and pride
with incense, kindled at the muse's flame
far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
their sober wishes never learn'd to stray
along the cool sequester'd vale of life
they kept the noiseless tenour of their way
yet e'en those bones from insult to protect
some frail memorial still erected nigh
with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd
implores the passing tribute of a sigh
their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered muse
the place of fame and elegy supply
and many a holy text around she strews
that teach the rustic moralist to die
for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey
this pleasing anxious being e'er resigned
left the warm precincts of the cheerful day
nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind
on some fond breast the parting soul relies
some pious drops the closing eye requires
e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries
e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires
for thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead
dost in these lines their artless tale relate
if chance, by lonely contemplation led
some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate
haply some hoary-headed swain may say
brushing with hasty steps the dews away
to meet the sun upon the upland lawn
that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high
his listless length at noon-tide would he stretch
and pore upon the brook that babbles by
muttering his wayward fancies he would rove
now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn
or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love
along the heath, and near his favourite tree
another came; nor yet beside the rill
nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he
slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne
approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
graved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn
here rests his head upon the lap of earth
a youth to fortune and to fame unknown
fair science frown'd not on his humble birth
and melancholy mark'd him for her own
large was his bounty, and his soul sincere
heaven did a recompense as largely send
he gave to mis'ry all he had, a tear
he gain'd from heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend
no farther seek his merits to disclose
or draw his frailties from their dread abode
the bosom of his father and his god
and age for counsel; each year, each period of a man's life is but the
necessary step to the next. youth is an uncertain thing to bank on
the best is yet to be
the last of life for which the first was made
keynote
grow old along with me
the best is yet to be
the last of life, for which the first was made
our times are in his hand
who saith, "a whole i plann'd
youth shows but half; trust god: see all nor be afraid
not that, amassing flowers
youth sigh'd, "which rose make ours
which lily leave and then as best recall
not that, admiring stars
it yearn'd, "nor jove, nor mars
mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all
not for such hopes and fears
annulling youth's brief years
do i remonstrate: folly wide the mark
rather i prize the doubt
low kinds exist without
finish'd and finite clods, untroubled by a spark
poor vaunt of life indeed
were man but formed to feed
on joy, to solely seek and find and feast
such feasting ended, then
as sure an end to men
irks care the crop-full bird? frets doubt the maw-cramm'd beast
rejoice we are allied
to that which doth provide
and not partake, effect and not receive
a spark disturbs our clod
nearer we hold of god
who gives, than of his tribes that take, i must believe
then, welcome each rebuff
that turns earth's smoothness rough
each sting, that bids nor sit nor stand, but go
be our joys three parts pain
strive, and hold cheap the strain
learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe
for thence,--a paradox
which comforts while it mocks
shall life succeed in that it seems to fail
what i aspired to be
and was not, comforts me
a brute i might have been, but would not sink i' the scale
what is he but a brute
whose flesh has soul to suit
whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play
to man, propose this test
thy body at its best
how far can that project thy soul on its lone way
yet gifts should prove their use
i own the past profuse
of power each side, perfection every turn
eyes, ears took in their dole
brain treasured up the whole
should not the heart beat once "how good to live and learn
not once beat "praise be thine
i see the whole design
i, who saw power, see now love perfect too
perfect i call thy plan
thanks that i was a man
maker, remake, complete,--i trust what thou shalt do
for pleasant is this flesh
our soul, in its rose-mesh
pull'd ever to the earth, still yearns for rest
would we some prize might hold
to match those manifold
possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best
let us not always say
i strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole
as the bird wings and sings
let us cry, "all good things
are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul
therefore i summon age
to grant youth's heritage
life's struggle having so far reached its term
thence shall i pass, approved
a man, for aye removed
from the developed brute; a god though in the germ
and i shall thereupon
take rest, ere i be gone
once more on my adventure brave and new
fearless and unperplex'd
when i wage battle next
what weapons to select, what armour to indue
youth ended, i shall try
my gain or loss thereby
leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold
and i shall weigh the same
give life its praise or blame
young, all lay in dispute; i shall know, being old
for note, when evening shuts
a certain moment cuts
the deed off, calls the glory from the gray
a whisper from the west
shoots--"add this to the rest
take it and try its worth: here dies another day
so, still within this life
though lifted o'er its strife
let me discern, compare, pronounce at last
that acquiescence vain
the future i may face now i have proved the past
for more is not reserved
to man, with soul just nerved
to act to-morrow what he learns to-day
here, work enough to watch
the master work, and catch
hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play
as it was better, youth
should strive, through acts uncouth
toward making, than repose on aught found made
so, better, age, exempt
from strife, should know, than tempt
further. thou waitedest age: wait death nor be afraid
enough now, if the right
and good and infinite
be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own
with knowledge absolute
subject to no dispute
from fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone
be there, for once and all
sever'd great minds from small
announced to each his station in the past
was i, the world arraigned
were they, my soul disdain'd
right? let age speak the truth and give us peace at last
now, who shall arbitrate
ten men love what i hate
shun what i follow, slight what i receive
ten, who in ears and eyes
match me: we all surmise
they this thing, and i that: whom shall my soul believe
not on the vulgar mass
call'd "work," must sentence pass
things done, that took the eye and had the price
o'er which, from level stand
the low world laid its hand
found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice
but all, the world's coarse thumb
and finger fail'd to plumb
so pass'd in making up the main account
all instincts immature
all purposes unsure
that weigh'd not as his work, yet swell'd the man's amount
thoughts hardly to be pack'd
into a narrow act
fancies that broke through language and escaped
all i could never be
all, men ignored in me
this, i was worth to god, whose wheel the pitcher shaped
ay, note that potter's wheel
that metaphor! and feel
why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay
thou, to whom fools propound
when the wine makes its round
fool! all that is, at all
lasts ever, past recall
earth changes, but thy soul and god stand sure
what enter'd into thee
time's wheel runs back or stops: potter and clay endure
he fix'd thee 'mid this dance
of plastic circumstance
this present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest
machinery just meant
to give thy soul its bent
try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impress'd
what though the earlier grooves
which ran the laughing loves
around thy base, no longer pause and press
what though, about thy rim
scull-things in order grim
grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress
look not thou down but up
to uses of a cup
the festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal
the new wine's foaming flow
the master's lips aglow
thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel
but i need, now as then
thee, god, who mouldest men
and since, not even while the whirl was worst
did i,--to the wheel of life
with shapes and colours rife
bound dizzily,--mistake my end, to slake thy thirst
so, take and use thy work
amend what flaws may lurk
what strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim
my times be in thy hand
perfect the cup as plann'd
lest age approve of youth, and death complete the same
ever written. it is a battle-song and a pæan of victory
and the strong man must go
and bade me creep past
this poem is included in this book because these lines are enough to
reconcile any one to any fate
fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat
the mist in _my_ face
when the snows begin, and the blasts denote
i am nearing the place
the power of the night, the press of the storm
the post of the foe
where he stands, the arch fear in a visible form
yet the strong man must go
for the journey is done and the summit attained
and the barriers fall
though a battle's to fight ere a guerdon be gained
the reward of it all
i was ever a fighter, so--one fight more
the best and the last
i would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forebore
and bade me creep past
no! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers
the heroes of old
bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
of pain, darkness, and cold
for sudden the worst turns the best to the brave
the black minute's at end
and the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave
shall dwindle, shall blend
shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain
then a light, then thy breast
o thou soul of my soul! i shall clasp thee again
and with god be the rest
the "recessional" (by rudyard kipling, 1865-) is one of the most
popular poems of this century. it is a warning to an age and a nation
drunk with power, a rebuke to materialistic tendencies and
boastfulness, a protest against pride
god of our fathers, known of old
lord of our far-flung battle-line
beneath whose awful hand we hold
dominion over palm and pine
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
the tumult and the shouting dies
the captains and the kings depart
still stands thine ancient sacrifice
an humble and a contrite heart
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
far-called our navies melt away
on dune and headland sinks the fire
lo, all our pomp of yesterday
is one with nineveh and tyre
judge of the nations, spare us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
if, drunk with sight of power, we loose
wild tongues that have not thee in awe
such boasting as the gentiles use
or lesser breeds without the law
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
for heathen heart that puts her trust
in reeking tube and iron shard
all valiant dust that builds on dust
and guarding calls not thee to guard
for frantic boast and foolish word
thy mercy on thy people, lord! amen
is a rebuke to the insolent pride of kings and empires. it is extremely
picturesque. it finds a place here because more elderly scholars of
good judgment are pleased with it. i remember an old gray-haired
scholar in chicago who often recited it to his friends merely because
it touched his fancy
i met a traveller from an antique land
who said: "two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert. near them on the sand
half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things
the hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed
and on the pedestal these words appear
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair
nothing beside remains. round the decay
of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away
favourite poem
o why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud
a flash of the lightning, a break of the wave
he passes from life to his rest in the grave
the leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade
be scattered around and together be laid
and the young and the old, and the low and the high
shall moulder to dust and together shall lie
the child that a mother attended and loved
the mother that infant's affection that proved
the husband that mother and infant that blessed
each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest
the maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye
shone beauty and pleasure,--her triumphs are by
and the memory of those that beloved her and praised
are alike from the minds of the living erased
the hand of the king that the scepter hath borne
the brow of the priest that the miter hath worn
the eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave
are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave
the peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap
the herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep
the beggar that wandered in search of his bread
have faded away like the grass that we tread
the saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven
the sinner that dared to remain unforgiven
the wise and the foolish, the guilty and just
have quietly mingled their bones in the dust
so the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed
that wither away to let others succeed
so the multitude comes, even those we behold
to repeat every tale that hath often been told
for we are the same that our fathers have been
we see the same sights that our fathers have seen
we drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun
and we run the same course that our fathers have run
the thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think
from the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink
to the life we are clinging to, they too would cling
but it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing
they loved, but their story we cannot unfold
they scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold
they grieved, but no wail from their slumbers may come
they enjoyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb
they died, ay! they died! and we things that are now
who walk on the turf that lies over their brow
who make in their dwellings a transient abode
meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road
yea! hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain
are mingled together like sunshine and rain
and the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge
still follow each other, like surge upon surge
from the blossom of health to the paleness of death
from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud
o why should the spirit of mortal be proud
the last four lines of this sonnet form the most tremendous climax in
literature. the picture is as vivid as if done with a brush. every
great book, every great poem is a new world, an undiscovered country
every learned person is a whole territory, a universe of new thought
every one who does anything with a heart for it, every specialist every
one, however simple, who is strenuous and genuine, is a "new
discovery." let us give credit to the smallest planet that is true to
its own orbit
much have i travelled in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep-brow'd homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he stared at the pacific--and all his men
look'd at each other with a wild surmise
silent, upon a peak in darien
here is a hero who does a great deed simply as a part of his day's
work. he puts no value on what he has done, because he could have done
no other way
on the sea and at the hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two
did the english fight the french--woe to france
and, the thirty-first of may, helter-skelter through the blue
like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
came crowding ship on ship to st. malo on the rance
with the english fleet in view
first and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, damfreville
close on him fled, great and small
twenty-two good ships in all
and they signalled to the place
get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick--or, quicker still
here's the english can and will
then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leaped on board
laughed they
and scored
shall the _formidable_ here, with her twelve and eighty guns
think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way
trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons
and with flow at full beside
now 'tis slackest ebb of tide
reach the mooring! rather say
while rock stands or water runs
not a ship will leave the bay
then was called a council straight
brief and bitter the debate
all that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow
for a prize to plymouth sound
better run the ships aground
let the captains all and each
shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach
france must undergo her fate
was ever spoke or heard
for up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
a captain? a lieutenant? a mate--first, second, third
no such man of mark, and meet
with his betters to compete
but a simple breton sailor pressed by tourville for the fleet
a poor coasting pilot he, hervé riel, the croisiekese
and "what mockery or malice have we here?" cries hervé riel
talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
on my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
are you bought by english gold? is it love the lying's for
morn and eve, night and day
have i piloted your bay
entered free and anchored fast at the foot of solidor
burn the fleet and ruin france? that were worse than fifty hogues
sirs, they know i speak the truth! sirs, believe me there's a way
only let me lead the line
have the biggest ship to steer
get this _formidable_ clear
make the others follow mine
and i lead them, most and least, by a passage i know well
right to solidor past grève
and there lay them safe and sound
and if one ship misbehave
why, i've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries hervé riel
not a minute more to wait
take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief
captains, give the sailor place
he is admiral, in brief
still the north wind, by god's grace
see the noble fellow's face
as the big ship, with a bound
clears the entry like a hound
keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound
see, safe through shoal and rock
how they follow in a flock
not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground
not a spar that comes to grief
the peril, see, is past
all are harboured to the last
and just as hervé riel hollas "anchor!"--sure as fate
up the english come--too late
so, the storm subsides to calm
they see the green trees wave
on the heights o'erlooking grève
hearts that bled are stanched with balm
let the english rake the bay
gnash their teeth and glare askance
as they cannonade away
how hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance
out burst all with one accord
let france, let france's king
thank the man that did the thing
what a shout, and all one word
as he stepped in front once more
not a symptom of surprise
in the frank blue breton eyes
just the same man as before
then said damfreville, "my friend
i must speak out at the end
though i find the speaking hard
praise is deeper than the lips
you have saved the king his ships
you must name your own reward
demand whate'er you will
france remains your debtor still
ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not damfreville
then a beam of fun outbroke
on the bearded mouth that spoke
as the honest heart laughed through
those frank eyes of breton blue
since on board the duty's done
and from malo roads to croisic point, what is it but a run
since 'tis ask and have, i may
since the others go ashore
come! a good whole holiday
leave to go and see my wife, whom i call the belle aurore
that he asked and that he got,--nothing more
name and deed alike are lost
not a pillar nor a post
in his croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell
not a head in white and black
on a single fishing smack
in memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
all that france saved from the fight whence england bore the bell
go to paris: rank on rank
search the heroes flung pell-mell
on the louvre, face and flank
you shall look long enough ere you come to hervé riel
so, for better and for worse
hervé riel, accept my verse
in my verse, hervé riel, do thou once more
save the squadron, honour france, love thy wife the belle aurore
of the world to the other. emerson teaches one lesson above all others
that each soul must work out for itself its latent force, its own
individual expression, and that with a "sad sincerity." "the bishop of
the soul" can do no more
i like a church; i like a cowl
i love a prophet of the soul
and on my heart monastic aisles
fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles
yet not for all his faith can see
would i that cowlèd churchman be
why should the vest on him allure
which i could not on me endure
not from a vain or shallow thought
his awful jove young phidias brought
never from lips of cunning fell
the thrilling delphic oracle
out from the heart of nature rolled
the burdens of the bible old
the litanies of nations came
like the volcano's tongue of flame
up from the burning core below
the canticles of love and woe
the hand that rounded peter's dome
and groined the aisles of christian rome
wrought in a sad sincerity
himself from god he could not free
he builded better than he knew
the conscious stone to beauty grew
knowst thou what wove yon woodbird's nest
of leaves and feathers from her breast
or how the fish outbuilt her shell
painting with morn each annual cell
or how the sacred pine-tree adds
to her old leaves new myriads
such and so grew these holy piles
while love and terror laid the tiles
earth proudly wears the parthenon
as the best gem upon her zone
and morning opes with haste her lids
to gaze upon the pyramids
o'er england's abbeys bends the sky
as on its friends, with kindred eye
for out of thought's interior sphere
these wonders rose to upper air
and nature gladly gave them place
adopted them into her race
and granted them an equal date
with andes and with ararat
these temples grew as grows the grass
art might obey, but not surpass
the passive master lent his hand
to the vast soul that o'er him planned
and the same power that reared the shrine
bestrode the tribes that knelt within
ever the fiery pentecost
girds with one flame the countless host
trances the heart through chanting choirs
and through the priest the mind inspires
the word unto the prophet spoken
was writ on tables yet unbroken
the word by seers or sibyls told
in groves of oak, or fanes of gold
still floats upon the morning wind
still whispers to the willing mind
one accent of the holy ghost
the heedless world hath never lost
i know what say the fathers wise
the book itself before me lies
old chrysostom, best augustine
and he who blent both in his line
the younger golden lips or mines
taylor, the shakespeare of divines
his words are music in my ear
i see his cowlèd portrait dear
and yet, for all his faith could see
i would not the good bishop be
poem and a great poem. it is a keen thrust at the common practice of
teaching american children to hate the english of these days on account
of the actions of a silly old king dead a hundred years. alfred austin
deserves great credit for this poem
what is the voice i hear
on the winds of the western sea
sentinel, listen from out cape clear
and say what the voice may be
and it says to them: "kinsmen, hail
we severed have been too long
now let us have done with a worn-out tale
the tale of an ancient wrong
and our friendship last long as our love doth and be stronger
than death is strong
answer them, sons of the self-same race
and blood of the self-same clan
let us speak with each other face to face
and answer as man to man
and loyally love and trust each other as none but free men can
now fling them out to the breeze
shamrock, thistle, and rose
and the star-spangled banner unfurl with these
a message to friends and foes
wherever the sails of peace are seen and wherever the war-wind blows
a message to bond and thrall to wake
for wherever we come, we twain
the throne of the tyrant shall rock and quake
and his menace be void and vain
for you are lords of a strong land and we are lords of the main
yes, this is the voice of the bluff march gale
we severed have been too long
but now we have done with a worn-out tale
the tale of an ancient wrong
and our friendship last long as love doth last and stronger
than death is strong
it is quite true that the english flag stands for freedom the world
over. wherever it floats almost any one is safe, whether english or
some time, but ultimately when it fell the crowds rent the air with
shouts, and seemed to see significance in the incident.--_daily
papers
winds of the world, give answer? they are whimpering to and fro
and what should they know of england who only england know
the poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag
they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at
the english flag
must we borrow a clout from the boer--to plaster anew with dirt
an irish liar's bandage, or an english coward's shirt
we may not speak of england; her flag's to sell or share
what is the flag of england? winds of the world, declare
the north wind blew:--"from bergen my steel-shod van-guards go
i chase your lazy whalers home from the disko floe
by the great north lights above me i work the will of god
that the liner splits on the ice-field or the dogger fills with cod
because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
i took the sun from their presence, i cut them down with my blast
and they died, but the flag of england blew free ere the spirit passed
the musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the northern light
what is the flag of england? ye have but my bergs to dare
ye have but my drifts to conquer. go forth, for it is there
the south wind sighed:--"from the virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en
over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed
breakers croon
their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon
i waked the palms to laughter--i tossed the scud in the breeze
never was isle so little, never was sea so lone
but over the scud and the palm-trees an english flag was flown
on the horn
i have chased it north to the lizard--ribboned and rolled and torn
i have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea
i have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free
where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross
what is the flag of england? ye have but my reefs to dare
ye have but my seas to furrow. go forth, for it is there
the east wind roared:--"from the kuriles, the bitter seas, i come
and me men call the home-wind, for i bring the english home
look--look well to your shipping! by the breath of my mad typhoon
i swept your close-packed praya and beached your best at kowloon
i raped your richest roadstead--i plundered singapore
i set my hand on the hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose
and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows
but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for england's sake
man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid
because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed
the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
what is the flag of england? ye have but my sun to dare
ye have but my sands to travel. go forth, for it is there
the west wind called:--"in squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
that bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die
they make my might their porter, they make my house their path
till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath
they bellow one to the other, the frightened ship-bells toll
for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath
and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death
i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
first of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky
dipping between the rollers, the english flag goes by
the naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist
what is the flag of england? ye have but my breath to dare
ye have but my waves to conquer. go forth, for it is there
american ought to be proud of it, for we want no such type allowed to
be developed in this country as the low-browed peasant of france. this
poem is a stroke of genius. the story goes that it so offended a modern
plutocrat that he offered a reward of $10,000 to any one who could
write an equally good poem in rebuttal. "the man with the hoe" has won
for edwin markham the title of "poet laureate of the labouring
classes
god made man in his own image, in the image of god made he
bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
upon his hoe and gazes on the ground
the emptiness of ages in his face
and on his back the burden of the world
who made him dead to rapture and despair
a thing that grieves not and that never hopes
stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox
who loosened and let down this brutal jaw
whose was the hand that slanted back this brow
whose breath blew out the light within this brain
is this the thing the lord god made and gave
to have dominion over sea and land
to trace the stars and search the heavens for power
to feel the passion of eternity
is this the dream he dreamed who shaped the suns
and marked their ways upon the ancient deep
down all the stretch of hell to its last gulf
there is no shape more terrible than this
more tongued with censure of the world's blind greed
more filled with signs and portents for the soul
more fraught with menace to the universe
what gulfs between him and the seraphim
slave of the wheel of labour, what to him
are plato and the swing of pleiades
what the long reaches of the peaks of song
the rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose
through this dread shape the suffering ages look
time's tragedy is in that aching stoop
through this dread shape humanity betrayed
plundered, profaned, and disinherited
cries protest to the judges of the world
a protest that is also prophecy
o masters, lords, and rulers in all lands
is this the handiwork you give to god
this monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched
how will you ever straighten up this shape
touch it again with immortality
give back the upward looking and the light
rebuild in it the music and the dream
make right the immemorial infamies
perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes
o masters, lords, and rulers in all lands
how will the future reckon with this man
how answer his brute question in that hour
when whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world
how will it be with kingdoms and with kings
with those who shaped him to the thing he is
when this dumb terror shall reply to god
after the silence of the centuries
characteristic poems. i love the swing and the stride of his great long
lines. i love his rough-shod way of trampling down and kicking out of
the way the conventionalities that spring up like poisonous mushrooms
to make the world a vast labyrinth of petty "proprieties" until
everything is nasty. i love the oxygen he pours on the world. i love
his genius for brotherliness, his picture of the negro with rolling
eyes and the firelock in the corner. these excerpts are some of his
best lines
i celebrate myself, and sing myself
and what i assume you shall assume
for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you
i loafe and invite my soul
i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass
my tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air
born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their
parents the same
i, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin
hoping to cease not till death
i harbor for good or bad, i permit to speak at every hazard
nature without check with original energy
have you reckoned a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the
earth much
have you practised so long to learn to read
have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems
stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin
of all poems
you shall possess the good of the earth and sun (there are
millions of suns left
you shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look
through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters in books
you shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me
you shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself
a child said, "_what is the grass?_" fetching it to me with full hands
how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is any more
than he
i guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green
stuff woven
or, i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord
a scented gift and remembrance designedly dropt
bearing the owner's name some way in the corners
that we may see and remark, and say
alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt
wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee
in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night
kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game
falling asleep on the gathered leaves with my dog and gun by my side
the yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle
and scud
my eyes settle the land, i bend at her prow or shout joyously from
the deck
the boatman and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me
i tucked my trouser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time
you should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle
the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside
i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile
through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak
and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him
and brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and
bruis'd feet
and gave him a room that entered from my own, and gave him some
coarse clean clothes
and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness
and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles
he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passed north
i had him sit next me at table, my firelock lean'd in the corner
i am the poet of the woman the same as the man
and i say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man
and i say there is nothing greater than the mother of men
i understand the large hearts of heroes
the courage of present times and all times
how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship
and death chasing it up and down the storm
how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of
days and faithful of nights
and chalked in large letters on a board, "_be of good cheer, we will
not desert you
how he followed with them and tack'd with them three days and would
not give it up
how he saved the drifting company at last
how the lank loose-gown'd women looked when boated from the side
of their prepared graves
how the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the
sharp-lipp'd unshaved men
all this i swallow, it tastes good, i like it well, it becomes mine
i am the man, i suffered, i was there
the disdain and calmness of martyrs
the mother of old, condemned for a witch, burned with dry wood, her
children gazing on
the hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence blowing
covered with sweat
i am the hounded slave, i wince at the bite of the dogs
hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen
i clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the
ooze of my skin
i fall on the weeds and stones
the riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close
taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with
whip-stocks
old age superbly rising! o welcome, ineffable grace of dying days
see ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that
count ever so much, there is limitless time around that
my rendezvous is appointed, it is certain
the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms
the great camerado, the lover true for whom i pine will be there
and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
funeral drest in his shroud
and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds
the learning of all times
and there is no trade or employment but the young man following
it may become a hero
and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd
universe
and i say to any man or woman, "let your soul stand cool and composed
before a million universes
i see something of god each hour of the twenty-four, and each
moment then
in the faces of men and women i see god, and in my own face in
the glass
i find letters from god dropt in the street, and every one is
sign'd by god's name
and i leave them where they are, for i know that wheresoe'er i go
others will punctually come forever and ever
listener up there! what have you to confide in me
look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening
longer
who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with
his supper
who wishes to walk with me
i too am not a bit tamed, i too am untranslatable
i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world
when silence flees before the voice of love
of what expression does that god approve
is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice
or stately prose, made regal by his voice
speaks love in couplets, or in epics grand
and is love humble, or does he command
there is no language that love does not speak
to-day commanding and to-morrow meek
one hour laconic and the next verbose
with hope triumphant and with doubt morose
his varying moods all forms of speech employ
to give expression to his painful joy
to voice the phases of his joyful pain
he rings the changes on the poet’s strain
yet not in epic, epigram or verse
can love the passion of his heart rehearse
all speech, all language, is inadequate
there are no words with love commensurate
between the little here and larger yonder
there is a realm (or so one day i read
where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander
till some remembering soul from earth has fled
then, reunited, they go forth afar
from sphere to sphere, where wondrous angels are
not many spirits in that realm are waiting
not many pause upon its shores to rest
for only love, intense and unabating
can hold them from the longer, higher quest
and after grief has wept itself to sleep
few hearts on earth their vital memories keep
should i pass on, across the mystic border
let thy love link me to that pallid land
i would not seek the heavens of finer order
until thy barque had left this coarser strand
how desolate such journeyings would be
though straight to him, were they not shared by thee
wert thou first called (dear god, how could i bear it
i should enchain thee with my love, i know
not great enough am i to free thy spirit
from all these tender ties, and bid thee go
nor would a soul, unselfish as thine own
forget so soon, and speed to heaven alone
on earth we find no joy in ways diverging
how could we find it in the worlds unseen
i know old memories from my bosom surging
would keep thee waiting in that land between
until together, side by side, we trod
a path of stars, in our great search for god
midway upon the route, he paused athirst
and suddenly across the wastes of heat
he saw cool waters gleaming, and a sweet
green oasis upon his vision burst
a tender dream, long in his bosom nursed
spread love’s illusive verdure for his feet
the barren sands changed into golden wheat
the way grew glad that late had seemed accursed
she shone, the woman wonder, on his soul
the garden spot, for which men toil and wait
the house of rest, that is each heart’s demand
but when, at last, he reached the gleaming goal
he found, oh, cruel irony of fate
but desert sun upon the desert sand
i know the need of the world
though it would not have me know
it would hide its sorrow deep
where only god may go
yet its secret it can not keep
it tells it awake, or asleep
it tells it to all who will heed
and he who runs may read
the need of the world i know
i know the need of the world
when it boasts of its wealth the loudest
when it flaunts it in all men’s eyes
when its mien is the gayest and proudest
oh! ever it lies—it lies
for the sound of its laughter dies
in a sob and a smothered moan
and it weeps when it sits alone
the need of the world i know
i know the need of the world
when the earth shakes under the tread
of men who march to the fight
when rivers with blood are red
and there is no law but might
and the wrong way seems the right
when he who slaughters the most
is all men’s pride and boast
the need of the world i know
i know the need of the world
when it babbles of gold and fame
it is only to lead us astray
from the thing that it dare not name
for this is the sad world’s way
oh! poor blind world grown grey
with the need of a thing so near
with the want of a thing so dear
the need of the world i know
the need of the world is love
deep under the pride of power
down under its lust of greed
for the joys that last but an hour
there lies forever its need
for love is the law and the creed
and love is the unnamed goal
of life, from man to the mole
love is the need of the world
skilled mariner, and counted sane and wise
that was a curious thing which chanced to me
so good a sailor on so fair a sea
with favouring winds and blue unshadowed skies
led by the faithful beacon of love’s eyes
past reef and shoal, my life-boat bounded free
and fearless of all changes that might be
under calm waves, where many a sunk rock lies
a golden dawn; yet suddenly my barque
strained at the sails, as in a cyclone’s blast
and battled with an unseen current’s force
for we had entered when the night was dark
that old tempestuous gulf stream of the past
but for love’s eyes, i had not kept the course
his art was loving; eres set his sign
upon that youthful forehead, and he drew
the hearts of women, as the sun draws dew
love feeds love’s thirst as wine feeds love of wine
nor is there any potion from the vine
which makes men drunken like the subtle brew
of kisses crushed by kisses; and he grew
inebriated with that draught divine
yet in his sober moments, when the sun
of radiant summer paled to lonely fall
and passion’s sea had grown an ebbing tide
from out the many, memory singled one
full cup that seemed the sweetest of them all—
the world an abject vassal to her charms
and kings competing for a single smile
yet love she knew not, till upon this isle
she gave surrender to abducting arms
not theseus, who plucked her lips’ first kiss
not menelaus, lawful mate and spouse
such answering passion in her heart could rouse
or wake such tumult in her soul as this
let come what will, let greece and asia meet
let heroes die and kingdoms run with gore
let devastation spread from shore to shore—
resplendent helen finds her bondage sweet
the whole world fights her battles, while she lies
sunned in the fervour of young paris’ eyes
the battles ended, ardent paris dead
of faithful menelaus long bereft
time is the only suitor who is left
helen survives, with youth and beauty fled
by hate remembered, but by love forgot
dethroned and driven from her high estate
unhappy helen feels the lash of fate
and knows at last an unloved woman’s lot
the grecian marvel, and the trojan joy
the world’s fair wonder, from her palace flies
the furies follow, and great helen dies
a death of horror, for the pride of troy
helen, immortal in her beauty, lives
lais when young, and all her charms in flower
lais, whose beauty was the fateful light
that led great ships to anchor in the night
and bring their priceless cargoes to her bower
lais yet found her cup of sweet turned sour
great plato’s pupil, from his lofty height
zenocrates, unmoved, had seen the white
sweet wonder of her, and defied her power
she snared the world in nets of subtle wiles
the proud, the famed, all clamoured at her gate
dictators plead, inside her portico
wisdom sought madness, in her favouring smiles
now was she made the laughing-stock of fate
one loosed her clinging arms, and bade her go
lais, when old and all her beauty gone
lais, the erstwhile courted pleasure queen
walked homeless through corinth
one mocked her mien—
one tossed her coins; she took them and passed on
down by the harbour sloped a terraced lawn
where fountains played; she paused to view the scene
a marble palace stood in bowers of green
’twas here of old she revelled till the dawn
through yonder portico her lovers came—
hero and statesman, athlete, merchant, sage
they flung the whole world’s treasures at her feet
to buy her favour and exalt her shame
and faded like a phantom down the street
you are here, and you are wanted
though a waif upon life’s stair
though the sunlit hours are haunted
with the shadowy shapes of care
still the great one, the all-seeing
called your spirit into being—
gave you strength for any fate
since your life by him was needed
all your ways by him are heeded—
you can trust and you can wait
you can wait to know the meaning
of the troubles sent your soul
of the chasms intervening
’twixt your purpose and your goal
of the sorrows and the trials
of the silence and denials
ofttimes answering to your pleas
of the stinted sweets of pleasure
and of pain’s too generous measure—
you can wait the _why_ of these
forth from planet unto planet
you have gone, and you will go
space is vast, but we must span it
for life’s purpose is _to know
earth retains you but a minute
make the best of what lies in it
light the pathway where you are
there is nothing worth the doing
that will leave regret or rueing
as you speed from star to star
you are part of the beginning
you are parcel of to-day
when he set his world to spinning
you were flung upon your way
when the system falls to pieces
when this pulsing epoch ceases
when the _is_ becomes the _was
you will live, for you will enter
in the great creative centre
in the all-enduring cause
sailing away on a summer sea
out of the bleak march weather
drifting away for a loaf and play
just you and i together
and it’s good-bye worry and good-bye hurry
and never a care have we
with the sea below and the sun above
and nothing to do but dream and love
sailing away together
sailing away from the grim old town
and tasks the town calls duty
sailing away from walls of grey
to a land of bloom and beauty
and it’s good-bye to letters from our lessers and our betters
to the cold world’s smile or its frown
we sail away on a sunny track
to find the summer and bring it back
and love is our only duty
afloat on a sea of passion
without a compass or chart
but the glow of your eye shows the sun is high
by the sextant of my heart
i know we are nearing the tropics
by the languor that round us lies
and the smile on your mouth says the course is south
and the port is paradise
we have left grey skies behind us
we sail under skies of blue
you are off with me on lovers’ sea
and i am away with you
we have not a single sorrow
and i have but one fear—
that my lips may miss one offered kiss
from the mouth that is smiling near
there is no land of winter
there is no world of care
there is bloom and mirth all over the earth
and love, love everywhere
our boat is the barque of pleasure
and whatever port we sight
the touch of your hand will make the land
the harbour of pure delight
i wrenched from a passing comet in its flight
by that great force of two mad hearts aflame
a soul incarnate, back to earth you came
to glow like star-dust for a little night
deep shadows hide you wholly from our sight
the centuries leave nothing but your name
tinged with the lustre of a splendid shame
that blazed oblivion with rebellious light
the mighty passion that became your cause
still burns its lengthening path across the years
we feel its raptures, and we see its tears
and ponder on its retributive laws
time keeps that deathless story ever new
yet finds no answer, when we ask of you
at argenteuil, i saw the lonely cell
where heloise dreamed through her broken rest
that baby lips pulled at her undried breast
it needed but my woman’s heart to tell
of those long vigils and the tears that fell
when aching arms reached out in fruitless quest
as after flight, wings brood an empty nest
across the centuries there comes no sound
of that vast anguish; not one sigh or word
or echo of the mother loss has stirred
the sea of silence, lasting and profound
yet to each heart, that once has felt this grief
sad memory restores time’s missing leaf
but what of you?  who took the mother’s place
when sweet expanding love its object sought
was there a voice to tell her tragic lot
and did you ever look upon her face
was yours a cloistered seeking after grace
or in the flame of adolescent thought
were abelard’s departed passions caught
to burn again in you and leave their trace
conceived in nature’s bold primordial way
you came to earth, a soul immaculate
baptized in fire, with some great part to play
what was that part, and wherefore hid from us
immortal mystery, astrolabius
when i shall meet god’s generous dispensers
of all the riches in the heavenly store
those lesser gods, who act as recompensers
for loneliness and loss upon this shore
methinks abashed, and somewhat hesitating
my soul its wish and longing will declare
lest they reply: ‘here are no bounties waiting
we gave on earth, your portion and your share.’
then shall i answer: ‘yea, i do remember
the many blessings to my life allowed
my june was always longer than december
my sun was always stronger than my cloud
my joy was ever deeper than my sorrow
my gain was ever greater than my loss
my yesterday seemed less than my to-morrow
the crown looked always larger than the cross
‘i have known love, in all its radiant splendour
it shone upon my pathway to the end
i trod no road that did not bloom with tender
and fragrant blossoms, planted by some friend
and those material things we call successes
in modest measure, crowned my earthly lot
yet was there one sweet happiness that blesses
the life of woman, which to me came not
‘i knew the hope of motherhood; a season
i felt a fluttering heart beat ’neath my own
a little cry—then silence.  for that reason
i dare, to you, my only wish make known
the babe who grew to angelhood in heaven
i never watched unfold from child to man
and so i ask, that unto me be given
that motherhood, which was god’s primal plan
‘all womankind he meant to share its glories
he meant us all to nurse our babes to rest
to croon them songs, to tell them sleepy stories
else why the wonder of a woman’s breast
he must provide for all earth’s cheated mothers
in his vast heavens of shining sphere on sphere
and with my son, there must be many others—
my spirit children who will claim me here
‘fair creatures by my loving thoughts created—
too finely fashioned for a mortal birth—
between the borders of two worlds they waited
until they saw my spirit leave the earth
in god’s great nursery they must be waiting
to welcome me with many an infant wile
now let me go and satisfy this longing
to mother children for a little while.’
as the grey twilight, tiptoed down the deep
and shadowy valley, to the day’s dark end
she whom i thought my ever-faithful friend
fair-browed, calm-eyed and mother-bosomed sleep
met me with smiles.  ‘poor longing heart, i keep
sweet joy for you,’ she murmured.  ‘i will send
one whom you love, with your own soul to blend
in visions, as the night hours onward creep.’
i trusted her; and watched by starry beams
i slumbered soundly, free from all alarms
then not my love, but one long banished came
led by false sleep, down secret stairs of dreams
and clasped me, unresisting in fond arms
oh, treacherous sleep—to sell me to such shame
meditating
now have i fully fixed upon my part
good-bye to dreams; for me a life of art
beloved art!  oh, realm serene and fair
above the mean and sordid world of care
above earth’s small ambitions and desires
art! art! the very word my soul inspires
from foolish memories it sets me free
not what has been, but that which is to be
absorbs me now.  adieu to vain regret
the bow is tensely drawn—the target set
maid (_aside
the night is dark and chill; the hour is late

’tis i, your fate
thou dost deceive, not me, but thine own self

that beats alone for glory, and for art

maid (_ignoring interruption
i yet shall stand before an audience
that listens as one mind, absorbed, intense
and with my genius i shall rouse its cheers
still it to silence, soften it to tears
or wake its laughter.  oh, the play! the play
the play’s the thing!  my boy, _the play
cupid (_suddenly clapping his hands
oh, say
i know a splendid role for you to take
and one that always keeps the house awake—
and calls for pretty dressing.  oh, it’s great
maid (_excitedly
well, well, what is it?  wherefore make me wait
cupid (_tapping his brow_, _thoughtfully
how is it those lines run—oh, now i know
you make a stately entrance—measured—slow—
to stirring music, then you kneel and say
something about—to honour and obey—
for better and for worse—till death do part
maid (_angrily
be still, you foolish boy; that is not _art
cupid (_seriously
she needs great skill who takes the role of wife
in god’s stupendous drama human life
maid (_suddenly becoming serious
so i once thought!  oh, once my very soul
was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role
life seemed so wonderful; it held for me
no purpose, no ambition, but to be
loving and loved.  my highest thought of fame
was some day bearing my dear lover’s name
alone, i ofttimes uttered it aloud
or wrote it down, half timid, and all proud
to see myself lost utterly in him
as some small star might joy in growing dim
when sinking in the sun; or as the dew
forgetting the brief little life it knew
in space, might on the ocean’s bosom fall
and ask for nothing—only to give all
cupid (_aside
now, _that’s_ the talk—it’s music to my ear
after that stuff on ‘art’ and a ‘career.’
i hope she’ll keep it up
maiden (_continuing her reverie
again my dream
shaped into changing pictures.  i would seem
to see myself in beautiful array
move down the aisle upon my wedding day
and then i saw the modest living-room
with lighted lamp, and fragrant plants in bloom
and books and sewing scattered all about
and just we two alone
cupid (_in glee aside
there’s not a doubt
i’ll land her yet
my dream kaleidoscope
changed still again, and framed love’s dearest hope—
the trinity of home; and life was good
and all its deepest meaning understood
‘_beautiful land of nod_.’  cupid _in ecstasy tiptoes about and clasps
his hands in delight
another scene! a matron in her prime
i saw myself glide peacefully with time
into the quiet middle years, content
with simple joys the dear home circle lent
my sons and daughters made my diadem
i saw my happy youth renewed in them
the pain of growing old lost all its sting
for love stood near—in winter, as in spring
dramatically
’twas but a dream!  i woke all suddenly
the world had changed!  and now life means to me
my art—the stage—excitement and the crowd—
the glare of many foot-lights—and the loud
applause of men, as i cry in rage
‘give me the dagger!’ or creep down the stage
in that sleep-walking scene.  oh, art like mine
will send the chills down every listener’s spine
and when i choose, salt tears shall freely flow
as in the moonlight i cry, ‘romeo!  romeo
oh, wherefore art thou, romeo?’
ay, ’tis done
my dream of home life
it is but begun
the heart but once can dream a dream so fair
and so henceforth love thoughts i do forswear
since faith in love has crumbled to the dust
in fame alone, i put my hope and trust
here’s one who will explain yourself to you
and make that old sweet dream of love come true
fix up your foolish quarrel; time is brief—
so waste no more of it in doubt or grief
cupid (_in doorway
warm lip to lip, and heart to beating heart
the cast is made—my lady has her part
is this the way to greet thy loving spouse
but now returned from scenes of blood and strife
i pray thee raise thy veil and let me gaze
upon that beauty which hath greater power
to conquer me than all the arts of war
my beauty!  ay, my _beauty_!  i do hold
in thy regard, no more an honoured place
than yonder marble pillar, or the gold
and jewelled wine-cup which thy lips caress
thou wouldst degrade me in the people’s sight
degrade thee, vashti?  rather do i seek
to show my people who are gathered here
how, as the consort of so fair a queen
i feel more pride than as the mighty king
for there be many rulers on the earth
but only _one_ such queen.  come, raise thy veil
ay! only _one_ such queen!  a queen is one
who shares her husband’s greatness and his throne
i am no more than yonder dancing girl
who struts and smirks before a royal court
but i will loose my veil and loose my tongue
now listen, sire—my master and my king
and let thy princes and the court give ear
’tis time all heard how vashti feels her shame
shame is no word to couple with thy name
shame and a spotless woman may not meet
even in a sentence.  choose another word
ay, _shame_, my lord—there is no synonym
that can give voice to my ignoble state
to be a thing for eyes to gaze upon
yet held an outcast from thy heart and mind
to hear my beauty praised but not my worth
to come and go at pleasure’s beck and call
while barred from wisdom’s conclaves!  think ye _that
a noble calling for a noble dame
why, any concubine amongst thy train
could play my royal part as well as i—
were she as fair
queen vashti, art thou _mad
i would behead another did he dare
to so besmirch thee with comparison
vashti (_to the court
gaze now your fill!  behold queen vashti’s eyes
how large they gleam beneath her inch of brow
how like a great white star, her splendid face
shines through the midnight forest of her hair
and see the crushed pomegranate of her mouth
observe her arms, her throat, her gleaming breasts
whereon the royal jewels rise and fall!—
and note the crescent curving of her hips
and lovely limbs suggested ’neath her robes
gaze, gaze, i say, for these have made her queen
she hath no mind, no heart, no dignity
worth royal recognition and regard
but her fair body approbation meets
and whets the sated appetite of kings
now ye have seen what she was bid to show
the queen hath played her part and begs to go
ay, vashti, go and never more return
not only hast thou wronged thine own true lord
and mocked and shamed me in the people’s eyes
but thou hast wronged all princes and all men
by thy pernicious and rebellious ways
queens act and subjects imitate.  so let
queen vashti weigh her conduct and her words
or be no more called ‘queen!’
i was a princess ere i was a queen
and worthy of a better fate than this
there lies the crown that made me queen in name
here stands the woman—wife in name alone
now, no more queen—nor wife—but woman still—
ay, and a woman strong enough to be
her own avenger
tell me thy name
my name, great sire, is esther
so thou art esther?  esther! ’tis a name
breathed into sound as softly as a sigh
a woman’s name should melt upon the lips
like love’s first kisses, and thy countenance
is fit companion for so sweet a name
thou art most kind.  i would my name and face
were mine own making and not accident
then i might feel elated at thy praise
where now i feel confusion
thou hast wit
as well as beauty, esther.  both are gems
that do embellish woman in man’s sight
yet they are gems of second magnitude
dost _thou_ possess the one great perfect gem—
the matchless jewel of the world called _love
sire, in the heart of every woman dwells
that wondrous perfect gem
then, esther, speak
and tell me what is _love_!  i fain would know
thy definition of that much-mouthed word
by woman most employed—least understood
what can a humble jewish maiden know
that would instruct a warrior and a king
i have but dreamed of love as maidens will
while thou hast known its fulness.  all the world
loves great ahasueras
all the world
are rarely loved as anything but kings
love, as i see it in the court and camp
means seeking royal favour.  i would know
how love is fashioned in a maiden’s dreams
sire, love seeks nothing that kings can bestow
love is the king of all kings here below
love makes the monarch but a bashful boy
love makes the peasant monarch in his joy
love seeks not place, all places are the same
when lighted by the radiance of love’s flame
who deems proud love could fawn to power and splendour
hath known not love, but some base-born pretender
if this be love, i would know more of it
speak on, fair esther!  what is love beside
love is in all things, all things are in love
love is the earth, the sea, the skies above
love is the bird, the blossom, and the wind
love hath a million eyes, yet love is blind
love is a tempest, awful in its might
love is the silence of a moon-lit night
love is the aim of every human soul
and he who hath not loved hath missed life’s goal
but tell me of thyself, of thine own dreams
how wouldst thou love, and how be loved again
who most doth love thinks least of love’s return
she is content to feel the passion burn
in her own bosom, and its sacred fire
consumes each selfish purpose and desire
’tis in the giving, love’s best rapture lies
not in the counting of the things it buys
yet, is there not vast anguish and despair
in love that finds no answering word or smile
so radiant is love, it lends a glow
to each dark sorrow and to every woe
to love completely is to part with pain
nor is there mortal who can love in vain
love is its own reward, it pays full measure
and in love’s sharpest grief lies subtlest pleasure
methinks, a mighty warrior, lord or king
must in thy fancy play the lover’s part
none else could wake such reverential thought
when woman loves one born of lowly state
her thought gives crown and sceptre to her mate
yet be he king, or chief of some great clan
she loves him but as woman loves a man
monarch or peasant, ’tis the same, i wis
when once she gives him love’s surrendering kiss
what were thy thoughts, sweet esther?  something passed
across thy face, that for a moment veiled
thy soul from mine, and left me desolate
thy thoughts were not of me
ay, _all_ of thee
i wondered, if in truth, thou wert content
with me—thy choice.  was there no other one
of all who passed before thee at thy court
whose memory pursues thee with regret
i do confess i much regret that day
and wish i could relive it
oh!  my lord
yea!  i regret those hours i wasted on
the poor procession that preceded thee
hadst thou come first, then all the added wealth
of one long day of loving thee were mine—
a boundless fortune squandered.  though i live
to three score years and ten, as i do hope
in wedded love beside thee, that one day
was filched from me and cannot be restored
and then to think how frightened and abashed
i hung outside thy gates from early morn
not daring to go in and meet thine eyes
till pitying twilight clothed me in her veil
and evening walked beside me to thy door
so it was thou, fair thief, who stole that day
and made me poorer, by—how many hours
full eight, i think.  they seemed a hundred then
and now time flies a hundred times too fast
then eight more kisses do i claim from thee
this very hour—first tithes of many due
i shall exact these payments as i will
and if they be not ready on demand
i’ll lock thee in the prison of my arms
like this—and take them so—and so—and so
but kings must think of other things than love
and live for other aims than happiness
i would not drag thee from thy altitude
of mighty ruler and great conqueror
to chain thee by my side
such slavery
would please me better than to conquer earth
without thee, esther.  i have stood on heights
and heard the cheers of multitudes below
have known the loneliness of being great
now, let me live and love thee, like a man
forgetting i am king—
i am content
content is not the pathway to great deeds
as man, i hold thee higher than all kings
as king, thou must stand higher than all men
in other eyes.  let no one say of me
‘she spoiled his greatness by her littleness
she made a languorous lover of a king
and silenced war-cries on commanding lips—
with honeyed kisses; made her woman’s arms
preferred to armour, and her couch to tents
until the kingdom, with no guiding hand
plunged down to ruin.’
thou wouldst have me go—
so soon thy heart hath wearied
my heart is bursting with its love for thee
canst thou not feel its fervour?  but great men
need wiser guidance than a woman’s heart
my pride in thee is equal to my love
and i would have thee greater than thou art—
ay, greater than all other men on earth—
though forced long years to feed my hungry heart
on food of memories and wine of tears
wert thou but winning glory and renown
thou art most noble, esther; thou art fit
to be the consort of a king of kings
but i have chewed upon ambition’s husks
and starved for love through all my manhood’s years
and now the mighty gods have seen it fit
to spread love’s banquet and to name thee host
may i not feast my fill?  o esther, take
the tempting nectar of those lips away
and give me wine to rouse the brute in me
to make me thirst for blood instead of love
wine!  wine!  i say
ahasueras, wait
methinks good music is wine turned to sound
here comes thy minstrel with an offering
pressed from the ripened fruit of my fond heart
mine own the words and mine the melody
and may it linger longer in thine ear
than on thy lip would stay the taste of wine
sing on
when from the field returning
love is a warrior’s yearning
love in his heart is burning
love is his dream
talk not to him of glory
speak not of faces gory
sing of love’s tender story
make it thy theme
sing of his lady’s tresses
sing of the smile that blesses
sing of the sweet caresses
and yet again
sing of fair children’s faces
sing of the dear home graces
sing till the vacant places
ring with thy strain
yet as the days go speeding
shall he arise unheeding
love songs or words of pleading
strong in his might
helmet and armour wearing
hies he to deeds of daring
forth to the battle faring
back to the fight
sing now of ranks contending
sing of loud voices blending
sing of great warriors sending
death to their foes
sing of war missiles humming
strike into martial drumming
sing of great victory coming
as forth he goes
back to the battle faring
back into deeds of daring
back to the fight
no less a lover but a greater man
a better warrior and a nobler king
i will be from this hour for thy dear sake
god finished woman in the twilight hour
and said, ‘to-morrow thou shalt find thy place
man’s complement, the mother of the race—
with love the motive power—
the one compelling power.’
all night she dreamed and wondered.  with the light
her lover came—and then she understood
the purpose of her being.  life was good
and all the world seemed right—
and nothing was, but right
she had no wish for any wider sway
by all the questions of the world unvexed
supremely loving and superbly sexed
she passed upon her way—
her feminine fair way
but god neglected, when he fashioned man
to fuse the molten splendour of his mind
with that sixth sense he gave to womankind
and so he marred his plan—
ay, marred his own great plan
she asked so little, and so much she gave
that man grew selfish: and she soon became
to god’s great sorrow and the whole world’s shame
man’s sweet and patient slave—
his uncomplaining slave
yet in the nights (oh! nights so dark and long
she clasped her little children to her breast
and wept.  and in her anguish of unrest
she thought upon her wrong
she knew how great her wrong
and one sad hour, she said unto her heart
‘since thou art cause of all my bitter pain
i bid thee abdicate the throne: let brain
rule now, and do his part—
his masterful, strong part.’
she wept no more.  by new ambition stirred
her ways led out, to regions strange and vast
men stood aside and watched, dismayed, aghast
and all the world demurred—
misjudged her, and demurred
still on and up, from sphere to widening sphere
till thorny paths bloomed with the rose of fame
who once demurred, now followed with acclaim
the hiss died in the cheer—
the loud applauding cheer
she stood triumphant in that radiant hour
man’s mental equal, and competitor
but ah! the cost! from out the heart of her
had gone love’s motive power—
love’s all-compelling power
i dreamed a voice, of one god-authorised
cried loudly thro’ the world, ‘disarm!  disarm!’
and there was consternation in the camps
and men who strutted under braid and lace
beat on their medalled breasts, and wailed, ‘undone!’
the word was echoed from a thousand hills
and shop and mill, and factory and forge
where throve the awful industries of death
hushed into silence.  scrawled upon the doors
the passer read, ‘peace bids her children starve.’
but foolish women clasped their little sons
and wept for joy, not reasoning like men
again the voice commanded: ‘now go forth
and build a world for progress and for peace
this work has waited since the earth was shaped
but men were fighting, and they could not toil
the needs of life outnumber needs of death
leave death with god.  go forth, i say, and build.’
and then a sudden, comprehensive joy
shone in the eyes of men; and one who thought
only of conquests and of victories
woke from his gloomy reverie and cried
‘ay, come and build!  i challenge all to try
and i will make a world more beautiful
than eden was before the serpent came.’
and like a running flame on western wilds
ambition spread from mind to listening mind
and lo! the looms were busy once again
and all the earth resounded with men’s toil
vast palaces of science graced the world
their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth
for all who hungered.  music kissed the air
once rent with boom of cannons.  statues gleamed
from wooded ways, where ambushed armies hid
in times of old.  the sea and air were gay
with shining sails that soared from land to land
a universal language of the world
made nations kin, and poverty was known
but as a word marked ‘obsolete,’ like war
the arts were kindled with celestial fire
new poets sang so homer’s fame grew dim
and brush and chisel gave the wondering race
sublimer treasures than old greece displayed
men differed still; fierce argument arose
for men are human in this human sphere
but unarmed arbitration stood between
and reason settled in a hundred hours
what war disputed for a hundred years
oh, that a voice, of one god-authorised
might cry to all mankind, disarm!  disarm
once in a time of trouble and of care
i dreamed i talked with god about my pain
with sleepland courage, daring to complain
of what i deemed ungracious and unfair
‘lord, i have grovelled on my knees in prayer
hour after hour,’ i cried; ‘yet all in vain
no hand leads up to heights i would attain
no path is shown me out of my despair.’
then answered god: ‘three things i gave to thee—
clear brain, brave will, and strength of mind and heart
all implements divine, to shape the way
why shift the burden of thy toil on me
till to the utmost he has done his part
with all his might, let no man _dare_ to pray.’
two thousand years had passed since christ was born
when suddenly there rose a mighty host
of women, sweeping to a central goal
as many rivers sweep on to the sea
they came from mountains, valleys, and from coasts
and from all lands, all nations, and all ranks
speaking all languages, but thinking one
and that one language—peace
‘listen,’ they said
and straightway was there silence on the earth
for men were dumb with wonder and surprise
‘listen, o mighty masters of the world
and hear the edict of all womankind
since christ his new commandment gave to men
have passed away, yet earth is red with blood
the strong male rulers of the world proclaim
their weakness, when we ask that war shall cease
now will the poor weak women of the world
proclaim their strength, and say that war shall end
hear, then, our edict: never from this day
will any woman on the crust of earth
mother a warrior.  we have sworn the oath
and will go barren to the waiting tomb
rather than breed strong sons at war’s behest
or bring fair daughters into life, to bear
the pains of travail, for no end but war
ay! let the race die out for lack of babes
better a dying race than endless wars
better a silent world than noise of guns
and clash of armies
‘long we asked for peace
and oft you promised—but to fight again
at last you told us, war must ever be
while men existed, laughing at our plea
for the disarmament of all mankind
then in our hearts flamed such a mad desire
for peace on earth, as lights the world at times
with some great conflagration; and it spread
from distant land to land, from sea to sea
until all women thought as with one mind
and spoke as with one voice; and now behold
the great crusading syndicate of peace
filling all space with one supreme resolve
give us, o men, your word that war shall end
disarm the world, and we will give you sons—
sons to construct, and daughters to adorn
a beautiful new earth, where there shall be
fewer and finer people, opulence
and opportunity and peace for all
until you promise peace no shrill birth-cry
shall sound again upon the aging earth
we wait your answer.’
and the world was still
while men considered
at times i am the mother of the world
and mine seem all its sorrows, and its fears
that rose, which in each mother-heart is curled
the rose of pity, opens with my tears
and, waking in the night, i lie and hark
to the lone sobbing, and the wild alarms
of my world-child, a wailing in the dark
the child i fain would shelter in my arms
i call to it (as from another room
a mother calls, what time she cannot go
‘sleep well, dear world; love hides behind this gloom
there is no need for wakefulness or woe
the long, long night is almost past and gone
the day is near.’  and yet the world weeps on
again i follow it, throughout the day
with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall
and hurt itself in many a foolish way
childlike, unheeding warning word or call
i see it grasp, and grasping, break the toys
it cried to own, then toss them on the floor
and, breathless, hurry after fancied joys
that cease to please, when added to its store
i see the lacerations on its hands
made by forbidden tools; but when it weeps
i also weep, as one who understands
and having been a child, the memory keeps
ah, my poor world, however wrong thy part
still is there pity in my mother-heart
i cried, ‘dear angel, lead me to the heights
and spur me to the top.’
the angel answered, ‘stop
and set thy house in order; make it fair
for absent ones who may be speeding there
then will we talk of heights.’
i put my house in order.  ‘now lead on!’
the angel said, ‘not yet
thy garden is beset
by thorns and tares; go weed it, so all those
who come to gaze may find the unvexed rose
then will we journey on.’
i weeded well my garden.  ‘all is done.’
the angel shook his head
‘a beggar stands,’ he said
‘outside thy gates; till thou hast given heed
and soothed his sorrow, and supplied his need
say not that all is done.’
the beggar left me singing.  ‘now at last—
at last the path is clear.’
‘nay, there is one draws near
who seeks, like thee, the difficult highway
he lacks thy courage; cheer him through the day
then will we cry, “at last!”’
i helped my weaker brother.  ‘now the heights
oh, guide me, angel, guide!’
the presence at my side
with radiant face, said, ‘look, where are we now?’
and lo! we stood upon the mountain’s brow—
the heights, the shining heights
not great vesuvius, in all his ire
nor all the centuries, could hide your shame
there is the little window where you came
with eyes that woke the demon of desire
and lips like rose leaves, fashioned out of fire
and from the lava leaps the molten flame
of your old sins.  the walls cry out your name—
your face seems rising from the funeral pyre
there must have dwelt, within your fated town
full many a virtuous dame, and noble wife
who made your beauty seem as star to sun
how strange the centuries have handed down
your name, fair julia, of immoral life
and left the others to oblivion
master of sweet and loving lore
give us the open mind
to know religion means no more
no less, than being kind
give us the comprehensive sight
that sees another’s need
and let our aim to set things right
prove god inspired our creed
give us the soul to know our kin
that dwell in flock and herd
the voice to fight man’s shameful sin
against the beast and bird
give us a heart with love so fraught
for all created things
that even our unspoken thought
bears healing on its wings
give us religion that will cope
with life’s colossal woes
and turn a radiant face of hope
on troops of pigmy foes
give us the mastery of our fate
in thoughts so warm and white
they stamp upon the brows of hate
love’s glorious seal of light
give us the strong, courageous faith
that makes of pain a friend
and calls the secret word of death
‘beginning,’ and not ‘end.’
what is right living?  just to do your best
when worst seems easier.  to bear the ills
of daily life with patient cheerfulness
nor waste dear time recounting them
to talk
of hopeful things when doubt is in the air
to count your blessings often, giving thanks
and to accept your sorrows silently
nor question why you suffer.  to accept
the whole of life as one perfected plan
and welcome each event as part of it
to work, and love your work; to trust, to pray
for larger usefulness and clearer sight
this is right living, pleasing in god’s eyes
though you be heathen, heretic or jew
however inexplicable may seem
event and circumstance upon this earth
though favours fall on those whom none esteem
and insult and indifference greet worth
though poverty repays the life of toil
and riches spring where idle feet have trod
and storms lay waste the patiently tilled soil—
yet justice sways the universe of god
as undisturbed the stately stars remain
beyond the glare of day’s obscuring light
so justice dwells, though mortal eyes in vain
seek it persistently by reason’s sight
but when, once freed, the illumined soul looks out
its cry will be, ‘o god, how could i doubt!’
time looked me in the eyes while passing by
the milestone of the year.  that piercing gaze
was both an accusation and reproach
no speech was needed.  in a sorrowing look
more meaning lies than in complaining words
and silence hurts as keenly as reproof
oh, opulent, kind giver of rich hours
how have i used thy benefits!  as babes
unstring a necklace, laughing at the sound
of priceless jewels dropping one by one
so have i laughed while precious moments rolled
into the hidden corners of the past
and i have let large opportunities
for high endeavour move unheeded by
while little joys and cares absorbed my strength
and yet, dear time, set to my credit this
be patient with me.  though the sun slants west
the day has not yet finished, and i feel
necessity for action and resolve
bear in upon my consciousness.  i know
the earth’s eternal need of earnest souls
and the great hunger of the world for love
i know the goal to high achievement lies
through the dull pathway of self-conquest first
and on the stairs of little duties done
we climb to joys that stand thy test.  o time
be patient with me, and another day
perchance, in passing by, thine eyes may smile
in what i do i note the marring flaw
the imperfections of the work i see
nor am i one who rather _do_ than _be
since its reversal is creation’s law
nay, since there lies a better and a worse
a lesser and a larger, in men’s view
i would be better than the thing i do
as god is greater than his universe
he shaped himself before he shaped one world
a million eons, toiling day and night
he built himself to majesty and might
before the planets into space were hurled
and when creation’s early work was done
what crude beginnings out of chaos came—
a formless nebula, a wavering flame
an errant comet, a voracious sun
and, still unable to perfect his plan
what awful creatures at his touch found birth—
those protoplasmic monsters of the earth
that owned the world before he fashioned man
and now, behold the poor unfinished state
of this, his latest masterpiece!  then why
be troubled that no voice proclaims it great
before me lie the cycling rounds of years
with this small earth will die the thing i do
the thing i am, goes journeying onward through
a million lives, upon a million spheres
my work i build, as best i can and may
knowing all mortal effort ends in dust
i build myself, not as i may, but must
knowing, or good, or ill, that self must stay
along the ages, out, and on, afar
its journey leads, and must perforce be made
likewise its choice, with things of shame and shade
or up the path of light, from star to star
when all these solar systems shall disperse
perchance this labour, and this self-control
may find reward; and my completed soul
will fling in space, a little universe
art thou alive?  nay, not too soon reply
tho’ hand, and foot, and lip, and ear, and eye
respond, and do thy bidding yet may be
grim death has done his direst work with thee
life, as god gives it, is a thing apart
from active body and from beating heart
it is the vital spark, the unseen fire
that moves the mind to reason and aspire
it is the force that bids emotion roll
in mighty billows from the surging soul
it is the light that grows from hour to hour
and floods the brain with consciousness of power
it is the spirit dominating all
and reaching god with its imperious call
until the shining glory of his face
illuminates each sorrowful, dark place
it is the truth that sets the bondsman free
knowing he will be what he wills to be
with its unburied dead the earth is sad
art thou alive? proclaim it and be glad
perchance the dead may hear thee and arise
knowing they live, and _here_ is paradise
i love this age of energy and force
expectantly i greet each pregnant hour
emerging from the all-creative source
supreme with promise, imminent with power
the strident whistle and the clanging bell
the noise of gongs, the rush of motored things
are but the prophet voices which foretell
a time when thought may use unfettered wings
too long the drudgery of earth has been
a barrier ’twixt man and his own mind
remove the stone, and lo! the christ within
for he is there, and who so seeks shall find
the great inventor is the modern priest
he paves the pathway to a higher goal
once from the grind of endless toil released
man will explore the kingdom of his soul
and all this restless rush, this strain and strife
this noise and glare is but the fanfarade
that ushers in the more majestic life
where faith shall walk with science, unafraid
i feel the strong vibrations of the earth
i sense the coming of an hour sublime
and bless the star that watched above my birth
and let me live in this important time
unto each mortal who comes to earth
a ladder is given by god, at birth
and up this ladder the soul must go
step by step, from the valley below
step by step, to the centre of space
on this ladder of lives, to the starting place
in time departed (which yet endures
i shaped my ladder, and you shaped yours
whatever they are—they are what we made
a ladder of light, or a ladder of shade
a ladder of love, or a hateful thing
a ladder of strength, or a wavering string
a ladder of gold, or a ladder of straw
each is the ladder of righteous law
we flung them away at the call of death
we took them again with the next life breath
for a keeper stands by the great birth gates
as each soul passes, its ladder waits
though mine be narrow, and yours be broad
on my ladder alone can i climb to god
on your ladder alone can your feet ascend
for none may borrow, and none may lend
if toil and trouble and pain are found
twisted and corded, to form each round
if rusted iron or mouldering wood
is the fragile frame, you must make it good
you must build it over and fashion it strong
though the task be hard as your life is long
for up this ladder the pathway leads
to earthly pleasures and spirit needs
and all that may come in another way
shall be but illusion, and will not stay
in useless effort, then, waste no time
rebuild your ladder, and climb and climb
who is a christian in this christian land
of many churches and of lofty spires
not he who sits in soft upholstered pews
bought by the profits of unholy greed
and looks devotion, while he thinks of gain
not he who sends petitions from the lips
that lie to-morrow in the street and mart
not he who fattens on another’s toil
and flings his unearned riches to the poor
or aids the heathen with a lessened wage
and builds cathedrals with an increased rent
christ, with thy great, sweet, simple creed of love
how must thou weary of earth’s ‘christian’ clans
who preach salvation through thy saving blood
while planning slaughter of their fellow men
who is a christian?  it is one whose life
is built on love, on kindness and on faith
who holds his brother as his other self
and hides no aim or purpose in his heart
that will not chord with universal good
though he be pagan, heretic or jew
that man is christian and beloved of christ
all your wonderful inventions
all your houses vast and tall
all your great gun-fronted vessels
every fort and every wall
with the passing of the ages
they shall pass and they shall fall
as you sit among the idols
that your avarice gave birth
as you count the hoarded treasures
that you think of priceless worth
time is digging tombs to hide them
in the bosom of the earth
there shall come a great convulsion
or a rushing tidal wave
or a sound of mighty thunders
from a subterranean cave
and a boasting world’s possessions
shall be buried in one grave
from the centuries of silence
we are bringing back again
buried vase and bust and column
and the gods they worshipped then
in the strange unmentioned cities
built by prehistoric men
did they steal, and lie, and slaughter
did they steep their souls in shame
did they sell eternal virtues
just to win a passing fame
did they give the gold of honour
for the tinsel of a name
we are hurrying all together
toward the silence and the night
there is nothing worth the seeking
but the sun-kissed moral height—
there is nothing worth the doing
but the doing of the _right
i asked the rock beside the road what joy existence lent
it answered, ‘for a million years my heart has been content.’
i asked the truffle-seeking swine, as rooting by he went
‘what is the keynote of your life?’  he grunted out, ‘content.’
i asked a slave, who toiled and sung, just what his singing meant
he plodded on his changeless way, and said, ‘i am content.’
i asked a plutocrat of greed, on what his thoughts were bent
he chinked the silver in his purse, and said, ‘i am content.’
i asked the mighty forest tree from whence its force was sent
its thousand branches spoke as one, and said, ‘from discontent.’
i asked the message speeding on, by what great law was rent
god’s secret from the waves of space.  it said, ‘from discontent.’
i asked the marble, where the works of god and man were blent
what brought the statue from the block.  it answered, ‘discontent.’
i asked an angel, looking down on earth with gaze intent
how man should rise to larger growth.  quoth he, ‘through discontent.’
slowly the people waken; they have been
like weary soldiers, sleeping in their tents
while traitors tiptoed through the silent camp
intent on plunder.  suddenly a sound—
a careless movement of too bold a thief—
starts one dull sleeper; then another stirs
a third cries out a warning, and at last
the people are awake!  oh, when as one
the many rise, united and alert
with justice for their motto, they reflect
the mighty force of god’s omnipotence
and nothing stands before them.  lusty greed
tyrannical corruption long in power
and smirking cant (whose right hand robs and slays
so that the left may dower church and school
monopoly, whose mandate took from toil
the mother earth, that idleness might loll
and breed the monster of colossal wealth—
all these must fall before the gathering force
of public indignation.  that old strife
which marks the progress of each century
the war of right with might, is on once more
and shame to him who does not take his stand
this is the weightiest moment of all time
and on the issues of the present hour
a nation’s honour and a country’s peace
a people’s future, ay, a world’s, depends
until the vital questions of the day
are solved and settled, and the spendthrift thieves
who rob the coffers of the saving poor
are led from fashion’s feasts to prison fare
and taught the saving grace of honest work—
till labour claims the privilege of toil
and toil the proceeds of its labour shares—
let no man sleep, let no man dare to sleep
i am sorry in the gladness
of the joys that crown my days
for the souls that sit in sadness
or walk uninviting ways
on the radiance of my labour
that a loving fate bestowed
falls the shadow of my neighbour
crushed beneath a thankless load
as the canticle of pleasure
from my lovelit altar rolls
there is one discordant measure
as i think of homeless souls
and i know that grim old story
preached from pulpits, is not so
for no god could sit in glory
and see sinners writhe below
in that great eternal centre
where all human life has birth
boundless love and pity enter
and flow downward to the earth
and all souls in sin or sorrow
are but passing through the night
and i know on some to-morrow
god will love them into light
i heard a strange voice in the distance calling
as from a star an echo might be falling
it spoke four syllables, concise and brief
charged with a god-sent message of relief
hark to the new command and comfort borrow
even as the master left his cross below
and rose to paradise, let go, let go
forget your wrongs, your troubles and your losses
for with the tools of thought we build our crosses
forget your griefs, all grudges and all fear
and enter paradise—its gates are near
heaven is a realm by loving souls created
and hell was fashioned by the hearts that hated
love, hope and trust; believe all joys are yours
life pays the soul whose confidence endures
the blows of adverse fate, by larger pleasures
as after storms the soil yields fuller measures
let go the cross; roll self—the stone—away
and dwell with love in paradise to-day
when the summer sun is shining
and the green things push and grow
oft my heart runs over measure
with its flowing fount of pleasure
as i feel the sea winds blow
ah, then life is good, i know
and i think of sweet birds building
and of children fair and free
and of glowing sun-kissed meadows
and of tender twilight shadows
and of boats upon the sea
oh, then life seems good to me
then unbidden and unwanted
come the darker, sadder sights
city shop and stifling alley
where misfortune’s children rally
and the hot crime-breeding nights
and the dearth of god’s delights
and i think of narrow prisons
where unhappy songbirds dwell
and of cruel pens and cages
where some captured wild thing rages
like a madman in his cell
in the zoo, the wild beasts’ hell
and i long to lift the burden
of man’s selfishness and sin
and to open wide earth’s treasures
of god’s storehouse, full of pleasures
for my dumb and human kin
and to ask the whole world in
between the ringing of bells and the musical clang of chimes
i hear a sound like the breaking of chains, all through these
christmas times
for the thought of the world is waking out of a slumber deep and long
and the race is beginning to understand how right can master wrong
and the eyes of the world are opening wide, and great are the truths
they see
and the heart of the world is singing a song, and its burden is ‘be
free!’
now the thought of the world and the wish of the world and the song of
the world will make
a force so strong that the fetters forged for a million years must
break
fetters of superstitious fear have bound the race to creeds
that hindered the upward march of man to the larger faith he needs
fetters of greed and pride have made the race bow down to kings
but the pompous creed and the costly throne must yield to simpler
things
the thought of the world has climbed above old paths for centuries
and cloth and crown no longer mean the ‘vested power of god.’
the race no longer bends beneath the weight of adam’s sin
but stands erect and knows itself the maker’s first of kin
and the need of the world and the wish of the world and the song of
the world i hear
all through the clanging and clashing of bells, this christmas time o’
the year
and i hear a sound like the breaking of chains, and it seems to say to
in the voice of one who spoke of old, ‘the truth shall make men free.’
upon december’s windy portico
the old year stood, and looked out where the sun
went wading down the west, through drifting clouds
‘i, too, shall sink full soon to rest,’ he sighed
‘and follow where my children’s feet have trod
brave january, beauteous may and june
my lovely daughters, and my valiant sons
all, all save one, have left me for that bourne
men call the past.  it seems but yesterday
i saw fair august, laughing with the sea
snaring the earth with her seductive wiles
and making conquest, even of the sun
yet has she gone, and left me here to mourn.’
then spake december, from an open door
‘father, the night grows cold; come in and rest
sit with me here beside this glowing grate
i have not left thee; thou art not alone
my house is thine; all warm with love and light
and bright with holly and with cedar sweet
my stalwart arm is thine to lean upon
the feast is spread, i only wait for thee
god smiles upon thy dead, smile thou on me.’
then through the open door the old year passed
and darkness settled on the outer world
however certain of the way thou art
take not the self-appointed leader’s part
follow no man, and by no man be led
and no man lead.  _awake_, and go ahead
thy path, though leading straight unto the goal
might prove confusing to another soul
the goal is central; but from east, and west
and north, and south, we set out on the quest
from lofty mountains, and from valleys low:—
how could all find one common way to go
lord buddha to the wilderness was brought
lord jesus to the cross.  and yet, think not
by solitude, or cross, thou canst achieve
lest in thine own true self thou dost believe
know thou art one, with life’s almighty source
then are thy feet set on the certain course
nor does it matter if thou feast, or fast
or what thy creed—or where thy lot is cast
in halls of pleasure or in crowded mart
in city streets, or from all men apart—
thy path leads to the light; and peace and power
shall be thy portion, growing hour by hour
follow no man, and by no man be led
and no man lead.  but _know_ and go ahead
what shall the leader be in that great day
when we who sleep and dream that we are slaves
shall wake and know that liberty is ours
mark well that word—not yours, not mine, but ours
for through the mingling of the separate streams
of individual protest and desire
in one united sea of purpose, lies
the course to freedom
when progression takes
her undisputed right of way, and sinks
the old traditions and conventions where
they may not rise, what shall the leader be
no mighty warrior skilled in crafts of war
sowing earth’s fertile furrows with dead men
and staining crimson god’s cerulean sea
to prove his prowess to a shuddering world
nor yet a monarch with a silly crown
perched on an empty head, an in-bred heir
to senseless titles and anemic blood
no ruler, purchased by the perjured votes
of striving demagogues whose god is gold
not one of these shall lead to liberty
the weakness of the world cries out for strength
the sorrow of the world cries out for hope
its suffering cries for kindness
he who leads
must then be strong and hopeful as the dawn
that rises unafraid and full of joy
above the blackness of the darkest night
he must be kind to every living thing
kind as the krishna, buddha and the christ
and full of love for all created life
oh, not in war shall his great prowess lie
nor shall he find his pleasure in the chase
too great for slaughter, friend of man and beast
touching the borders of the unseen realms
and bringing down to earth their mystic fires
to light our troubled pathways, wise and kind
and human to the core, so shall he be
the coming leader of the coming time
hear thou my prayer, great god of opulence
give me no blessings, save as recompense
for blessings which i lovingly bestow
on needy stranger or on suffering foe
if wealth, by chance, should on my path appear
let wisdom and benevolence stand near
and charity within my portal wait
to guard me from acquaintance intimate
yet in this intricate great art of living
guide me away from misdirected giving
and show me how to spur the laggard soul
to strive alone once more to gain the goal
repay my worldly efforts to attain
only as i develop heart and brain
nor brand me with the ‘dollar sign’ above
a bosom void of sympathy and love
if on the carrying winds my name be blown
to any land or time beyond my own
let it not be as one who gained the day
by crowding others from the chosen way
rather as one who missed the highest place
pausing to cheer spent runners in the race
the greater boon i ask, dear god, from thee
thank god for life, in such an age as this
rich with the promises of better things
thank god for being part of this great nation’s heart
whose strong pulsations are not ruled by kings
our thanks for fearless and protesting speech
when cloven hoofs show ’neath the robes of state
for us no servile song of ‘kings can do no wrong.’
not royal birth, but worth, makes rulers great
thank god for peace within our border lands
and for the love of peace within each soul
who thinks on peace has wrought, mosaic-squares of thought
in the foundation of our future goal
our thanks for love, and knowledge of love’s laws
love is a greater power than vested might
love is the central source of all enduring force
love is the law that sets the whole world right
our thanks for that increasing torch of light
the tireless hand of science holds abroad
and may its growing blaze shine on all hidden ways
till man beholds the silhouette of god
i know it is early morning
and hope is calling aloud
and your heart is afire with youth’s desire
to hurry along with the crowd
but linger a bit by the roadside
and lend a hand by the way
’tis a curious fact that a generous act
brings leisure and luck to a day
i know it is only the noontime—
there is chance enough to be kind
but the hours run fast when noon has passed
and the shadows are close behind
so think while the light is shining
and act ere the set of the sun
for the sorriest woe that a soul can know
is to think what it might have done
i know it is almost evening
but the twilight hour is long
if you listen and heed each cry of need
you can right full many a wrong
for when we have finished the journey
we will all look back and say
‘on life’s long mile there was nothing worth while
but the good we did by the way.’
when with clanging and with ringing
comes the year’s initial day
i can feel the rhythmic swinging
of the world upon its way
and though right still wears a fetter
and though justice still is blind
time’s beyond is always better
than the paths he leaves behind
in our eons of existence
as we circle through the night
we annihilate the distance
’twixt the darkness and the light
from beginnings crude and lowly
round and round our souls have trod
through the circles, winding slowly
up to knowledge and to god
with each century departed
some old evil found a tomb
some old truth was newly started
in propitious soil to bloom
with each epoch some condition
that has handicapped the race
unto knowledge yields its place
though in folly and in blindness
and in sorrow still we grope
yet in man’s increasing kindness
lies the world’s stupendous hope
for our darkest hour of errors
is as radiant as the dawn
set beside the awful terrors
of the ages that have gone
and above the sad world’s sobbing
and the strife of clan with clan
i can hear the mighty throbbing
of the heart of god in man
and a voice chants through the chiming
of the bells, and seems to say
we are climbing, we are climbing
as we circle on our way
life is a privilege.  its youthful days
shine with the radiance of continuous mays
to live, to breathe, to wonder and desire
to feed with dreams the heart’s perpetual fire
to thrill with virtuous passions and to glow
with great ambitions—in one hour to know
the depths and heights of feeling—god! in truth
how beautiful, how beautiful is youth
life is a privilege.  like some rare rose
the mysteries of the human mind unclose
what marvels lie in earth and air and sea
what stores of knowledge wait our opening key
what sunny roads of happiness lead out
beyond the realms of indolence and doubt
and what large pleasures smile upon and bless
the busy avenues of usefulness
life is a privilege.  though noontide fades
and shadows fall along the winding glades
though joy-blooms wither in the autumn air
yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there
pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind
and in the serious hours of life we find
depths in the soul of men which lend new worth
and majesty to this brief span of earth
life is a privilege.  if some sad fate
sends us alone to seek the exit gate
if men forsake us as the shadows fall
still does the supreme privilege of all
come in that reaching upward of the soul
to find the welcoming presence at the goal
and in the knowledge that our feet have trod
paths that lead from and must lead back to god
before the statue of a giant hun
there stood a dwarf, misshapen and uncouth
his lifted eyes seemed asking: ‘why, in sooth
was i not fashioned like this mighty one
would god show favour to an older son
like earthly kings, and beggar without ruth
another, who sinned only by his youth
why should two lives in such divergence run?’
strange, as he gazed, that from a vanished past
no memories revived of war and strife
of misused prowess, and of broken law
that old hun’s spirit, in the dwarf re-cast
lived out the sequence of an earthly life
god, what a world, if men in street and mart
felt that same kinship of the human heart
which makes them, in the face of flame and flood
rise to the meaning of true brotherhood
among the virile hosts he passed along
conspicuous for an undetermined grace
of sexless beauty.  in his form and face
god’s mighty purpose somehow had gone wrong
then on his loom, he wove a careful song
of sensuous threads; a wordy web of lace
wherein the primal passions of the race
and his own sins made wonder for the throng
a little pen prick opened up a vein
and gave the finished mesh a crimson blot—
the last consummate touch of studied art
but those who knew strong passion and keen pain
looked through and through the pattern and found not
one single great emotion of the heart
when god had formed the universe, he thought
of all the marvels therein to be wrought
and to his aid then motherhood was brought
‘my lesser self, the feminine of me
she will go forth throughout all time,’ quoth he
‘and make my world what i would have it be
‘for i am weary, having laboured so
and for a cycle of repose would go
into that silence which but god may know
‘therefore i leave the rounding of my plan
to motherhood; and that which i began
let woman finish in perfecting man
‘she is the soil: the human mother earth
she is the sun, that calls the seed to earth
she is the gardener, who knows its worth
‘from me, all seed, of any kind must spring
divine the growth such seed and soil will bring
for all is me, and i am everything.’
thus having spoken to himself aloud
his glorious face upon his breast he bowed
and sought repose behind a wall of cloud
come forth, o god! though great thy thought and good
in shaping woman for true motherhood
lord, speak again; she has not understood
the centuries pass: the cycles roll along—
the earth is peopled with a mighty throng
yet men are fighting and the world goes wrong
lord, speak again, ere yet it be too late
unloved, unwanted souls come through earth’s gate
the unborn child is given a dower of hate
thy world progresses in all ways save one
in motherhood, for which it was begun
lord, lord, behold how little has been done
children are spawned like fishes in the sand
with ignorance and crime they fill the land
lord, speak again, till mothers understand
it is not all of motherhood to know
conception pleasure or deliverance woe
who plants the seed should help the shoot to grow
better a barren soil than weed and tare
or sickly plants that die for want of care
in poisonous jungles, void of sun and air
true motherhood is not alone to breed
the human race; it is to know and heed
its holiest purpose and its highest need
lord, speak again, so woman shall be stirred
with the full meaning of that mighty word
true motherhood.  she has not rightly heard
unhoused in deserts of accepted thought
and lost in jungles of confusing creeds
my soul strayed, homeless, finding its own needs
unsatisfied with what tradition taught
the pros and cons, the little ifs and ands
the but and maybe, and the this and that
on which the churches thicken and grow fat
i found but structures built on shifting sands
and all their heavens were strange and far away
and all their hells were made of human hate
and since for death i did not care to wait
a heaven i fashioned for myself one day
of happy thoughts i built it stone by stone
with joy of life i draped each spacious room
with love’s great light i drove away all gloom
and in the centre i made god a throne
and this dear heaven i set within my heart
and carried it about with me alway
and then the changing dogmas of the day
seemed alien to my thoughts and held no part
now as i take my heaven from place to place
i find new rooms by love’s revealing light
and death will give me but a larger sight
to see my palace spreading into space
on a bleak, bald hill with a dull world under
the dreary world of the commonplace
i have stood when the whole world seemed a blunder
of dotard time, in an aimless race
with worry about me and want before me—
yet deep in my soul was a rapture spring
that made me cry to the grey sky o’er me
‘oh, i know this life is a goodly thing!’
i have given sweet years to a thankless duty
while cold and starving, though clothed and fed
for a young heart’s hunger for joy and beauty
is harder to bear than the need of bread
i have watched the wane of a sodden season
which let hope wither, and made care thrive
and through it all, without earthly reason
i have thrilled with the glory of being alive
and now i stand by the great sea’s splendour
where love and beauty feed heart and eye
the brilliant light of the sun grows tender
as it slants to the shore of the by and by
i prize each hour as a golden treasure—
a pearl time drops from a broken string
and all my ways are the ways of pleasure
and i know this life is a goodly thing
and i know, too, that not in the seeing
or having, or doing the things we would
lies that deep rapture that comes from being
and not from pleasure the heart may borrow
that rare contentment for which we strive
unless through trouble, and want, and sorrow
it has thrilled with the glory of being alive
there is no summit you may not attain
no purpose which you may not yet achieve
if you will wait serenely and believe
each seeming loss is but a step toward gain
between the mountain-tops lie vale and plain
let nothing make you question, doubt or grieve
give only good, and good alone receive
and as you welcome joy, so welcome pain
that which you most desire awaits your word
throw wide the door and bid it enter in
speak, and the strong vibrations shall be stirred
speak, and above earth’s loud, unmeaning din
your silent declarations shall be heard
all things are possible to god’s own kin
talk not of strength, until your heart has known
and fought with weakness through long hours alone
talk not of virtue, till your conquering soul
has met temptation and gained full control
boast not of garments, all unscorched by sin
till you have passed, unscathed, through fires within
oh, poor that pride the unscarred soldier shows
who safe in camp, has never faced his foes
a granite rock in the mountain side
gazed on the world and was satisfied
it watched the centuries come and go
it welcomed the sunlight, yet loved the snow
it grieved when the forest was forced to fall
yet joyed when steeples rose, white and tall
in the valley below it, and thrilled to hear
the voice of the great town roaring near
when the mountain stream from its idle play
was caught by the mill wheel and borne away
and trained to labour, the grey rock mused
‘trees and verdure and stream are used
by man the master; but i remain
friend of the mountain, and star, and plain
unchanged forever by god’s decree
while passing centuries bow to me.’
then all unwarned, with a mighty shock
out of the mountain was wrenched the rock
bruised and battered and broken in heart
it was carried away to the common mart
wrecked and ruined in piece and pride
‘oh, god is cruel,’ the granite cried
‘comrade of mountains, of stars the friend
by all deserted, how sad my end.’
a dreaming sculptor in passing by
gazed at the granite with thoughtful eye
then stirred with a purpose supremely grand
he bade his dream in the rock expand
and lo! from the broken and shapeless mass
that grieved and doubted, it came to pass
that a glorious statue of priceless worth
and infinite beauty, adorned the earth
‘_since sinus crossed the milky way_, _sixty thousand years have
since sirius crossed the milky way
full sixty thousand years have gone
yet hour by hour, and day by day
this tireless star speeds on and on
methinks he must be moved to mirth
by that droll tale of genesis
which says creation had its birth
for such a puny world as this
to hear how one who fashioned all
those solar systems, tier on tiers
expressed in little adam’s fall
the purpose of a million spheres
and, witness of the endless plan
to splendid wrath he must be wrought
by pigmy creeds presumptuous man
sends forth as god’s primeval thought
perchance from half a hundred stars
he hears as many curious things
from venus, jupiter and mars
and saturn with the beauteous rings
there may be students of the cause
who send their revelations out
and formulate their codes of laws
with heavens for faith and hells for doubt
on planets old ere form or place
was lent to earth, may dwell—who knows—
a god-like and perfected race
that hails great sirius as he goes
in zones that circle moon and sun
’twixt world and world, he may see souls
whose span of earthly life is done
still journeying up to higher goals
and on dead planets grey and cold
grim spectral souls, that harboured hate
life after life, he may behold
descending to a darker fate
and on his grand majestic course
he may have caught one glorious sight
of that vast shining central source
from which proceeds all life, all light
since sirius crossed the milky way
full sixty thousand years have gone
no mortal man may bid him stay
no mortal man may speed him on
no mortal mind may comprehend
what is beyond, what was before
to god be glory without end
let man be humble and adore
at fontainebleau, i saw a little bed
fashioned of polished wood, with gold ornate
ambition, hope, and sorrow, ay, and hate
once battled there, above a childish head
and there in vain, grief wept, and memory plead
it was so small! but ah, dear god, how great
the part it played in one sad woman’s fate
how wide the gloom, that narrow object shed
the symbol of an over-reaching aim
the emblem of a devastated joy
it spoke of glory, and a blasted home
of fleeting honours, and disordered fame
and the lone passing of a fragile boy
look in the eyes of trouble with a smile
extend your hand and do not be afraid
’tis but a friend who comes to masquerade
and test your faith and courage for awhile
fly, and he follows fast with threat and jeer
shrink, and he deals hard blow on stinging blow
but bid him welcome as a friend, and lo
the jest is off—the masque will disappear
is the way hard and thorny, oh, my brother
do tempests beat, and adverse wild winds blow
and are you spent, and broken, at each nightfall
yet with each morn you rise and onward go
brother, i know, i know
i, too, have journeyed so
is your heart mad with longing, oh, my sister
are all great passions in your breast aglow
does the white wonder of your own soul blind you
and are you torn with rapture and with woe
sister, i know, i know
i, too, have suffered so
is the road filled with snare and quicksand, pilgrim
do pitfalls lie where roses seem to grow
and have you sometimes stumbled in the darkness
and are you bruised and scarred by many a blow
pilgrim, i know, i know
i, too, have stumbled so
do you send out rebellious cry and question
as mocking hours pass silently and slow
does your insistent ‘wherefore’ bring no answer
while stars wax pale with watching, and droop low
i, too, have questioned so
but now _i know_, _i know
to toil, to strive, to err, to cry, to grow
when from the prison of its body free
my soul shall soar, before it goes to thee
thou great creator, give it power to know
the language of all sad, dumb things below
and let me dwell a season still on earth
before i rise to some diviner birth
invisible to men, yet seen and heard
and understood by sorrowing beast and bird—
invisible to men, yet always near
to whisper counsel in the human ear
and with a spell to stay the hunter’s hand
and stir his heart to know and understand
to plant within the dull or thoughtless mind
the great religious impulse to be kind
before i prune my spirit wings and rise
to seek my loved ones in their paradise
yea! even before i hasten on to see
that lost child’s face, so like a dream to me
i would be given this intermediate role
and carry comfort to each poor, dumb soul
and bridge man’s gulf of cruelty and sin
by understanding of his lower kin
’twixt weary driver and the straining steed
on wings of mercy would my spirit speed
and each should know, before his journey’s end
that in the other dwelt a loving friend
from zoo and jungle, and from cage and stall
i would translate each inarticulate call
each pleading look, each frenzied act and cry
and tell the story to each passer-by
and of a spirit’s privilege possessed
pursue indifference to its couch of rest
and whisper in its ear until in awe
it woke and knew god’s all-embracing law
of universal life—the one in all
‘hurry up!’
no lingering by old doors of doubt—
no loitering by the way
no waiting a to-morrow car
when you can board to-day
success is somewhere down the track
before the chance is gone
accelerate your laggard pace
swing on, i say, swing on—
hurry up
‘step lively!’
belated souls are following fast
they shout and signal, ‘wait.’
conductor time brooks no delay
he rings the bell of fate
but you can give the man behind
with one hand on the bar
a final chance to brook defeat
and board the moving car
step lively
‘move up!’
make way for others as you sit
or stand.  this crowded earth
has room for every journeying soul
en route to higher birth
ay, room and comfort, if no one
took double share or space
nor let his greed and selfishness
absorb another’s place
move up
‘hold fast!’
the jolting switch of obstacles
with jarring rails is near
stand firm of foot, be strong of grip
brace well and have no fear
the maker of the car of life
foresaw that curve—despair
and hung the straps of faith, and hope
so you might grasp them there
hold fast
send forth your heart’s desire, and work and wait
the opportunities of life are brought
to our own doors, not by capricious fate
but by the strong compelling force of thought
the wonderful age of the world i sing—
the age of battery, coil and spring
of steam, and storage, and motored thing
though faith may slumber and art seem dead
and all that is spoken has once been said
and all that is written were best unread
though hearts are iron and thoughts are steel
and all that has value is mercantile
yet marvellous truths shall the age reveal
ay, greater the marvels this age shall find
than all the centuries left behind
when faith was a bigot and art was blind
oh, sorry the search of the world for gods
through faith that slaughters and art that lauds
while reason sits on its throne and nods
but out of the leisure that men will know
when the cruel things of the sad earth go
a faith that is knowledge shall rise and grow
in the throb and whir of each new machine
thinner is growing the veil between
the visible earth and the worlds unseen
the true religion shall leisure bring
and art shall awaken and love shall sing
oh, ho! for the age of the motored thing
‘the night is cold, the hour is late, the world is bleak and drear
who is it knocking at my door?’
‘i am good cheer.’
‘your voice is strange; i know you not; in shadows dark i grope
what seek you here?’
‘friend, let me in; my name is hope.’
‘and mine is failure; you but mock the life you seek to bless
pass on.’
‘nay, open wide the door; i am success.’
‘but i am ill and spent with pain; too late has come your wealth
i cannot use it.’
‘listen, friend; i am good health.’
‘now, wide i fling my door.  come in, and your fair statements
prove.’
‘but you must open, too, your heart, for i am love.’
we have outgrown the helmet and cuirass
the spear, the arrow, and the javelin
these crude inventions of a cruder age
when men killed men to show their love of god
and he who slaughtered most was greatest king
we have outgrown the need of war
should men
unite in this one thought, all war would end
disarm the world; and let all nations meet
like men, not monsters, when disputes arise
when crossed opinions tangle into snarls
let courts untie them, and not armies cut
when state discussions breed dissensions, let
union and arbitration supersede
the hell-created implements of war
disarm the world! and bid destructive thought
slip like a serpent from the mortal mind
down through the marshes of oblivion.  soon
a race of gods shall rise!  disarm!  disarm
all wantonly in hours of joy
i made a song of pain
soon grief drew near, and paused to hear
and sang the sad refrain
again and yet again
then recklessly in my despair
i sang of hope one day
and joy turned back upon life’s track
and smiled, and came my way
and sat her down to stay
oh, a great world, a fair world, a true world i find it
a sun that never forgets to rise
on the darkest night, a star in the skies
and a god of love behind it
oh, a good life, a sweet life, a large life i take it
is what he offers to you, and me
a chance to do, and a chance to be
whatever we chose to make it
oh, a far way, a high way, a sure way he leads us
and if the journey at times seems long
we must trudge ahead, with a trustful song
and know at the end he needs us
the world is full of selfishness and greed
lord, i would lave its sin
yea, mortal, earth of thy good help has need
go cleanse _thyself_ within
mine ear is hurt by harsh and evil speech
i would reform men’s ways
there is but one convincing way to teach
speak _thou_ but words of praise
on every hand is wretchedness and grief
despondency and fear
lord, i would give my fellow men relief
be, then, all hope, all cheer
lord, i look outward and grow sick at heart
such need of change i see
mortal, look _in_.  do thy allotted part
a weed is but an unloved flower
go dig, and prune, and guide, and wait
until it learns its high estate
and glorifies some bower
a weed is but an unloved flower
all sin is virtue unevolved
release the angel from the clod—
go love thy brother up to god
behold each problem solved
all sin is virtue unevolved
who is the strong?  not he who puts to test
his sinews with the strong and proves the best
but he who dwells where weaklings congregate
and never lets his splendid strength abate
who is the good?  not he who walks each day
with moral men along the high, clean way
but he who jostles gilded sin and shame
yet will not sell his honour or his name
who is the wise?  not he who from the start
with wisdom’s followers has taken part
but he who looks in folly’s tempting eyes
and turns away, perceiving her disguise
who is serene?  not he who flees his kind
some mountain fastness, or some cave to find
but he who in the city’s noisiest scene
keeps calm within—he only is serene
body and mind, and spirit, all combine
to make the creature, human and divine
of this great trinity no part deny
affirm the body, beautiful and whole
the earth-expression of immortal soul
affirm the mind, the messenger of the hour
to speed between thee and the source of power
affirm the spirit, the eternal i—
of this great trinity no part deny
they stood before the angel at the gate
the angel asked: ‘why should you enter in?’
one said: ‘on earth my place was high and great;’
and one: ‘i warned my fellow-men from sin;’
another: ‘i was teacher of the faith
i scorned my life and lived in love with death.’
and one stood silent.  ‘speak!’ the angel said
‘what earthly deed has sent you here to-day?’
‘alas!  i did but follow where they led,’
he answered sadly: ‘i had lost my way—
so new the country, and so strange my flight
i only sought for guidance and for light.’
‘you have no passport?’  ‘none,’ the answer came
‘i loved the earth, tho’ lowly was my lot
i strove to keep my record free from blame
and make a heaven about my humble spot
a narrow life; i see it now, too late
so, angel, drive me from the heavenly gate.’
the angel swung the portal wide and free
and took the sorrowing stranger by the hand
‘nay, you alone,’ he said, ‘shall come with me
of all this waiting and insistent band
of what god gave, you built your paradise
behold your mansion waiting in the skies.’
unnumbered gods may unremembered die
a thousand creeds may perish and pass by
yet do i lift mine eyes to one on high
unnamed be he from whom creation came
there is no word whereby to speak his name
but petty men have mouthed it into shame
i lift mine eyes, and with a river’s force
my love’s full tide goes sweeping on its course
to that supreme and all-embracing source
then back through all those thirsting channels roll
the mighty billows of the over soul
and i am he, the portion and the whole
as little streams before the flood-tide flee
as rivers vanish to become the sea
oh, a word is a gem, or a stone, or a song
or a flame, or a two-edged sword
or a rose in bloom, or a sweet perfume
or a drop of gall, is a word
you may choose your word like a connoisseur
and polish it up with art
but the word that sways, and stirs, and stays
is the word that comes from the heart
you may work on your word a thousand weeks
but it will not glow like one
that all unsought, leaps forth white hot
when the fountains of feeling run
you may hammer away on the anvil of thought
and fashion your word with care
but unless you are stirred to the depths, that word
shall die on the empty air
for the word that comes from the brain alone
alone to the brain will speed
but the word that sways, and stirs, and stays
oh! that is the word men heed
lean on no mortal, love, and serve
but it was never god’s intent
your spirit from its path should swerve
to gain another’s point of view
as well might jupiter, or mars
go seeking help from other stars
instead of sweeping on, as you
look to the great eternal cause
and not to any man, for light
look in; and learn the wrong, and right
from your own soul’s unwritten laws
and when you question, or demur
let love be your interpreter
if fallacies come knocking at my door
i’d rather feed, and shelter full a score
than hide behind the black portcullis, doubt
and run the risk of barring one truth out
and if pretension for a time deceive
and prove me one too ready to believe
far less my shame, than if by stubborn act
i brand as lie, some great colossal fact
on my soul’s door, the latch-string hangs outside
within, the lighted candle.  let me guide
some errant follies, on their wandering way
rather, than wisdom give no welcoming ray
god, what a glory, is this consciousness
of life on life, that comes to those who seek
nor would i, if i might, to others speak
the fulness of that knowledge.  it can bless
only the eager souls, that willing, press
along the mountain passes, to the peak
not to the dull, the doubting, or the weak
will truth explain, or mystery confess
not to the curious or impatient soul
that in the start, demands the end be shown
and at each step, stops waiting for a sign
but to the tireless toiler toward the goal
shall the great miracles of god be known
and life revealed, immortal and divine
upon the wreckage of thy yesterday
design the structure of to-morrow.  lay
strong corner stones of purpose, and prepare
great blocks of wisdom, cut from past despair
shape mighty pillars of resolve, to set
deep in the tear-wet mortar of regret
work on with patience.  though thy toil be slow
yet day by day the edifice shall grow
believe in god—in thine own self believe
all that thou hast desired thou shalt achieve
our souls should be vessels receiving
the waters of love for relieving
the sorrows of men
for here lies the pleasure of living
in taking god’s bounties, and giving
the gifts back again
when the great universe was wrought
to might and majesty from naught
the all creative force was—
that force is thine.  though desolate
the way may seem, command thy fate
send forth thy thought—
create—_create
would you believe in presences unseen—
in life beyond this earthly life
be still: be stiller yet; and listen.  set the screen
of silence at the portal of your will
relax, and let the world go by unheard
and seal your lips with some all-sacred word
breathe ‘god,’ in any tongue—it means the same
love absolute: think, feel, absorb the thought
shut out all else; until a subtle flame
shall permeate your being, and shall glow
not in a moment, or an hour, or day
the knowledge comes; the power is far too great
to win in any desultory way
no soul is worthy till it learns to wait
day after day be patient, then, oh, soul
month after month—till, lo! the goal! the goal
give, and thou shalt receive.  give thoughts of cheer
of courage and success, to friend and stranger
and from a thousand sources, far and near
strength will be sent thee in thy hour of danger
give words of comfort, of defence, and hope
to mortals crushed by sorrow and by error
and though thy feet through shadowy paths may grope
thou shalt not walk in loneliness or terror
give of thy gold, though small thy portion be
gold rusts and shrivels in the hand that keeps it
it grows in one that opens wide and free
who sows his harvest is the one who reaps it
give of thy love, nor wait to know the worth
of what thou lovest; and ask no returning
and wheresoe’er thy pathway leads on earth
there thou shalt find the lamp of love-light burning
the leaf that ripens only in the sun
is dull and shrivelled ere its race is run
the leaf that makes a carnival of death
must tremble first before the north wind’s breath
the life that neither grief nor burden knows
is dwarfed in sympathy before its close
the life that grows majestic with the years
must taste the bitter tonic found in tears
fear is the twin of faith’s sworn foe, distrust
if one breaks in your heart the other must
fear is the open enemy of good
it means the god in man misunderstood
who walks with fear adown life’s road will meet
his boon companions, failure and defeat
but look the bully boldly in the eyes
with mien undaunted, and he turns and flies
between the finite and the infinite
the missing link of love has left a void
supply the link, and earth with heaven will join
in one continued chain of endless life
hell is wherever love is not, and heaven
is love’s location.  no dogmatic creed
no austere faith based on ignoble fear
can lead thee into realms of joy and peace
unless the humblest creatures on the earth
are bettered by thy loving sympathy
think not to find a paradise beyond
there is no sudden entrance into heaven
slow is the ascent by the path of love
i value more than i despise
my tendency to sin
because it helps me sympathise
with all my tempted kin
he who has nothing in his soul
that links him to the sod
knows not that joy of self-control
which lifts him up to god
and i am glad my heart can say
when others trip and fall
‘i understand it all.’
there was a thought he hid from all men’s eyes
and by his prudent life and deeds of worth
he left a goodly record upon earth
as one both pure and wise
but when he reached a dark unsightly door
beyond the grave, there stood his secret thought
it was the mansion he had built and brought
to dwell in, on that shore
an unkind tale was whispered in his ear
he paused to hear
his thoughts were food that helped a falsehood thrive
and keep alive
years dawned and died.  one day by venom’s tongue
his name was stung
he cried aloud, nor dreamed the lie was spawn
of thoughts long gone
each mental wave we send out from the mind
or base, or kind
completes its circuit, then with added force
seeks its own source
know this, ye restless denizens of earth
know this, ye seekers after joy and mirth
three things there are, eternal in their worth
love, that outreaches to the humblest things
work that is glad, in what it does and brings
and faith that soars upon unwearied wings
divine the powers that on this trio wait
supreme their conquest, over time and fate
love, work, and faith—these three alone are great
‘the slothful man saith, there is a lion in the way; a lion is in the
street.’—proverbs xxvi. 13
there are no lions in the street
no lions in the way
go seek the goal, thou slothful soul
awake, awake, i say
thou dost but dream of obstacles
in god’s great lexicon
that word illstarred, no page has marred
press on, i say, press on
nothing can keep thee from thine own
but thine own slothful mind
to one who knocks, each door unlocks
and he who seeks, shall find
lean on thyself until thy strength is tried
then ask god’s help; it will not be denied
use thine own sight to see the way to go
when darkness falls ask god the path to show
think for thyself and reason out thy plan
god has his work and thou hast thine, oh, man
exert thy will and use it for control
god gave thee jurisdiction of thy soul
all thine immortal powers bring into play
think, act, strive, reason, then look up and pray
who climbs the mountain does not always climb
the winding road slants downward many a time
yet each descent is higher than the last
has thy path fallen?  that will soon be past
beyond the curve the way leads up and on
think not thy goal forever lost or gone
keep moving forward; if thine aim is right
thou canst not miss the shining mountain height
who would attain to summits still and fair
must nerve himself through valleys of despair
‘there is no death, there are no dead.’
from zone to zone, from sphere to sphere
the souls of all who pass from here
by hosts of living thoughts are led
and dark or bright, those souls must tread
the paths they fashioned year on year
for hells are built of hate or fear
and heavens of love our lives have shed
across unatlassed worlds of space
and through god’s mighty universe
with thoughts that bless or thoughts that curse
each journeys to his rightful place
oh, greater truth no man has said
‘there is no death, there are no dead.’
it lifts the mourner from the sod
and bids him cast away the reed
of some uncomforting poor creed
and walk with knowledge for a rod
it bids the doubter seek the broad
vast fields, where living facts will feed
all those whose patience proves their need
of these immortal truths of god
it brings before the eyes of faith
those realms of radiance, tier on tier
where our beloved ‘dead’ appear
more beautiful because of ‘death.’
it speaks to grief: ‘be comforted
there is no death, there are no dead.’
hers was a lonely, shadowed lot
or so the unperceiving thought
who looked no deeper than her face
devoid of chiselled lines of grace—
no farther than her humble grate
and wondered how she bore her fate
yet she was neither lone nor sad
so much of love her spirit had
she found an ever-flowing spring
of happiness in everything
so near to her was nature’s heart
it seemed a very living part
of her own self; and bud and blade
and heat and cold, and sun and shade
and dawn and sunset, spring and fall
held raptures for her, one and all
the year’s four changing seasons brought
to her own door what thousands sought
in wandering ways and did not find—
diversion and content of mind
she loved the tasks that filled each day—
such menial duties; but her way
of looking at them lent a grace
to things the world deemed commonplace
obscure and without place or name
she gloried in another’s fame
poor, plain and humble in her dress
she thrilled when beauty and success
and wealth passed by, on pleasure bent
they made earth seem so opulent
yet none of quicker sympathy
when need or sorrow came, than she
and so she lived, and so she died
she woke as from a dream.  how wide
and wonderful the avenue
that stretched to her astonished view
and up the green ascending lawn
a palace caught the rays of dawn
then suddenly the silence stirred
with one clear keynote of a bird
a thousand answered, till ere long
the air was quivering bits of song
she rose and wandered forth in awe
amazed and moved by all she saw
for, like so many souls who go
away from earth, she did not know
the cord was severed
down the street
with eager arms stretched forth to greet
came one she loved and mourned in youth
her mother followed; then the truth
broke on her, golden wave on wave
of knowledge infinite.  the grave
the body and the earthly sphere
were gone!  immortal life was here
they led her through the palace halls
from gleaming mirrors on the walls
she saw herself, with radiant mien
and robed in splendour like a queen
while glory round about her shone
‘all this,’ love murmured, ‘is your own.’
and when she gazed with wondering eye
and questioned whence and where and why
love answered thus: ‘all heaven is made
by thoughts on earth; your walls were laid
year after year, of purest gold
the beauty of your mind behold
in this fair palace; ay, and more
waits farther on, so vast your store
i was not worthy when i died
to take my place here at your side
i toiled through long and weary years
from lower planes to these high spheres
and through the love you sent from earth
i have attained a second birth
oft when my erring soul would tire
i felt the strength of your desire
i heard you breathe my name in prayer
and courage conquered weak despair
ah! earth needs heaven, but heaven indeed
of earth has just as great a need.’
across the terrace with a bound
there sped a lambkin and a hound
and fondled her caressing hand
‘you loved them into paradise’
was answered to her questioning eyes
‘you taught them love; love has no end
nor does love’s life on form depend
if there be mortal without love
he wakes to no new life above
if love in humbler things exist
it must through other realms persist
hark!  hear the heavenly cherubim!’
then hushed and awed, with joy so vast
it knew no future and no past
she stood amidst the radiant throng
that came to swell love’s welcoming song—
this humble soul from earth’s far coast
the centre of the heavenly host
on earth they see her grave and say
‘she lies there till the judgment day;’
nor dream, so limited their thought
what miracles by love are wrought
o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but, o heart! heart! heart
o the bleeding drops of red
where on the deck my captain lies
fallen, cold and dead
o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells
rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
here captain! dear father
this arm beneath your head
it is some dream that on the deck
you've fallen cold and dead
my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will
the ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult, o shores! and ring, o bells
but i, with mournful tread
walk the deck my captain lies
fallen, cold and dead
for i dipt into the future, far as human eye could see
saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be
saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails
pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales
heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew
from the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue
far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm
with the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm
till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battleflags were furl'd
in the parliament of man, the federation of the world
there the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe
and the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law
the breaking waves dashed high
on a stern and rock-bound coast
and the woods against a stormy sky
their giant branches tossed
and the heavy night hung dark
the hills and waters o'er
when a band of exiles moored their bark
on the wild new england shore
not as the conqueror comes
they, the true-hearted, came
not with the roll of the stirring drums
and the trumpet that sings of fame
not as the flying come
in silence and in fear
they shook the depths of the desert's gloom
with their hymns of lofty cheer
amidst the storms they sang
and the stars heard, and the sea
and the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
to the anthem of the free
the ocean eagle soared
from his nest by the white wave's foam
and the rocking pines of the forest roared
this was their welcome home
there were men with hoary hair
amidst that pilgrim band
why had they come to wither there
away from their childhood's land
there was woman's fearless eye
lit by her deep love's truth
there was manhood's brow serenely high
and the fiery heart of youth
what sought they thus afar
bright jewels of the mine
the wealth of seas, the spoils of war
they sought a faith's pure shrine
ay, call it holy ground
the soil where first they trod
they have left unstained what there they found
freedom to worship god
for you know how i love thee
tell me, darling, will you be
the wife of bobby shaftoe
for you've asked me twice before
let us be good friends, no more
no more, bobby shaftoe
i will go away to sea
and you ne'er again shall be
a friend of bobby shaftoe
for you've said so twice to-day
stop! he's gone! dear bobby, stay
dearest bobby shaftoe
silver buckles on his knee
but he'll come back and marry me
pretty bobby shaftoe
and how happy i shall be
he'll come back and marry me
dearest bobby shaftoe
he cannot come back to thee
and you ne'er again will see
your dear bobby shaftoe
and regret we ne'er shall see
our friend bobby, true and free
dearest bobby shaftoe
and can ne'er come back to me
but i'll ever faithful be
true to bobby shaftoe
i've come back to marry thee
for i know you're true to me
true to bobby shaftoe
and now you've come back to me
and we will always happy be
dearest bobby shaftoe
and we will united be
heart and hand in unity
mr. and mrs. shaftoe
once there was a little boy
whose name was robert reese
and every friday afternoon
he had to speak a piece
so many poems thus he learned
that soon he had a store
of recitations in his head
and still kept learning more
now this it is what happened
he was called upon one week
and totally forgot the piece
he was about to speak
his brain he vainly cudgeled
but no word was in his head
and so he spoke at random
and this is what he said
my beautiful, my beautiful
who standest proudly by
it was the schooner hesperus
the breaking waves dashed high
why is the forum crowded
what means this stir in rome
under a spreading chestnut tree
there is no place like home
when freedom from her mountain height
cried, "twinkle, little star
shoot if you must this old gray head
king henry of navarre
if you're waking, call me early
to be or not to be
curfew must not ring to-night
oh, woodman, spare that tree
charge, chester, charge! on, stanley, on
and let who will be clever
the boy stood on the burning deck
but i go on for ever
the kid has gone to the colors
and we don't know what to say
the kid we have loved and cuddled
stepped out for the flag to-day
we thought him a child, a baby
with never a care at all
but his country called him man-size
and the kid has heard the call
he paused to watch the recruiting
where, fired by the fife and drum
he bowed his head to old glory
and thought that it whispered: "come
the kid, not being a slacker
stood forth with patriot-joy
to add his name to the roster
and god, we're proud of the boy
the kid has gone to the colors
it seems but a little while
since he drilled a schoolboy army
in a truly martial style
but now he's a man, a soldier
and we lend him a listening ear
for his heart is a heart all loyal
unscourged by the curse of fear
his dad, when he told him, shuddered
his mother--god bless her!--cried
yet, blest with a mother-nature
she wept with a mother-pride
but he whose old shoulders straightened
was granddad--for memory ran
to years when he, too, a youngster
was changed by the flag to a man
summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and conrad was gone away
gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay
we lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you've seen
roschen there was a baby, and i was only nineteen
conrad, he took the oxen, but he left kentucky belle
how much we thought of kentuck, i couldn't begin to tell
came from the blue-grass country; my father gave her to me
when i rode north with conrad, away from the tennessee
conrad lived in ohio--a german he is, you know
the house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row
the old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be
but i kept longing, longing, for the hills of the tennessee
oh, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill
clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still
but the level land went stretching away to meet the sky
never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye
from east to west, no river to shine out under the moon
nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon
only the breathless sunshine, as i looked out, all forlorn
only the rustle, rustle, as i walked among the corn
when i fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more
but moved away from the cornlands, out to this river shore
the tuscarawas it's called, sir--off there's a hill, you see
and now i've grown to like it next best to the tennessee
i was at work that morning. some one came riding like mad
over the bridge and up the road--farmer rouf's little lad
bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say
he sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find
morgan, morgan the raider, and morgan's terrible men
with bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen
the lad rode down the valley, and i stood still at the door
the baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor
kentuck was out in the pasture; conrad, my man, was gone
nearer, nearer, morgan's men were galloping, galloping on
sudden i picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar
i led her down the gully that turns off there to the right
and tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight
as i ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound
the ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground
coming into the turnpike out from the white woman glen
morgan, morgan the raider, and morgan's terrible men
as near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm
but still i stood in the doorway with baby on my arm
they came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along
morgan, morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong
weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day
pushing on east to the river, many long miles away
to the border strip where virginia runs up into the west
and fording the upper ohio before they could stop to rest
on like the wind they hurried, and morgan rode in advance
bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance
and i was just breathing freely, after my choking pain
when the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein
frightened i was to death, sir; i scarce dared look in his face
as he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place
i gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see
faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the tennessee
only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son
off and away with morgan before his life had begun
the damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth
and i thought me of the mother waiting down in the south
oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through
boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do
the boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be
worn out by his ride with morgan up from the tennessee
but when i told the laddie that i too was from the south
water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth
then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away
i had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to
i fed him, and i coaxed him, as i thought his mother'd do
and when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone
morgan's men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on
morgan--morgan is waiting for me; oh, what will morgan say
but i heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door
the ringing sound of horses' hoofs that i had heard before
and on, on, came the soldiers--the michigan cavalry
and fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly
they had followed hard on morgan's track; they had followed day and night
but of morgan and morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight
and rich ohio sat startled through all those summer days
for strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways
now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west
through river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best
a bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last
they almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast
but the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford
and morgan, morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword
well, i kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will
but he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still
when it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell
but i stole down to that gully, and brought up kentucky belle
i kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass
but i knew that she'd be happy back in the old blue-grass
a suit of clothes of conrad's, with all the money i had
and kentuck, pretty kentuck, i gave to the worn-out lad
i guided him to the southward as well as i know how
the boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow
and then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell
as down the glen away she went, my lost kentucky belle
when conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high
baby and i were both crying--i couldn't tell him why
but a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall
and a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in kentucky's stall
well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me
he knew i couldn't help it--'twas all for the tennessee
but, after the war was over, just think what came to pass
a letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old blue-grass
the lad had got across the border, riding kentucky belle
and kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well
he cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur
ah! we've had many horses since, but never a horse like her
i remember it all so very well, the first of my married life
that i can't believe it was years ago--it doesn't seem true at all
why, i just can see the little church where they made us man and wife
and the merry glow of the first wood-fire that danced on our cottage
to joe
and then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay
and our cup was full when joey came,--our baby-boy, you know
so, all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away
it wasn't long till joe found work, but 'twas never quite the same
never steady, with smaller pay; so to make the two ends meet
he fell to inventin' some machine--i don't recall the name
but he'd sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the
street
sit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about
i used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor
but 'twas just as if 'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out
even the baby--bless the child!--learned never to slam that door
people called him a clever man, and folks from the city came
to look at his new invention and wish my joe success
and joe would say, "little woman,"--for that was my old pet-name
dress
i didn't want 'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start
to see my joe with his restless eyes, his fingers worn away
to the skin and bone, for he wouldn't eat; and it almost broke my heart
when he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day
of course, with it all he lost his place. i couldn't blame the man
the foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in joe
for his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan
as with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro
yet, he kept on workin' at various things, till our little money went
for wheels and screws and metal casts and things i had never seen
and i ceased to ask, "any pay, my dear?" with the answer, "not a cent
when his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great
machine
i remember one special thing that year. he had bought some costly tool
when we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you
he went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from
school
and gravely said, "don't send me back; the children tease me so
i hadn't the heart to cross the child, so, while i sat and sewed
he would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side
and when the struggle was hardest and i felt keen hunger's goad
driving me almost to despair--the little baby died
her father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white
i swear by heaven, i will give it up!" yet, like a thief, that night
he stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew
too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild
i can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky
and the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried
child
joe still toiled in the little shop. somebody clicked the gate
a neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor
but i sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate
till i heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and i sprang to the workshop
that door was locked and the bolt shut fast. i could not cry, nor speak
but i snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread
and carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak
forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head
the front door yielded to my touch. i staggered faintly in
fearing--_what_? he stood unharmed, though the wall showed a
jagged hole
in his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin
of his own life's blood was not yet laid on the poor man's tortured soul
but the pistol held another charge, i knew; and like something mad
i shook my fist in my poor man's face, and shrieked at him, fierce and
all of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand
that hung so limp, i almost feared to see the pistol fall
a hopeless man. my plan has failed. that letter tells you all
then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death
only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o'er
but no;--there followed another sound, and i started, caught my breath
as a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door
i shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise
he must have guessed our awful state; he couldn't help but see
there was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes
told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to joe and me
he was come from a thriving city firm, and they'd sent him here to say
that _one_ of joe's inventions was a great, successful thing
and which do you think? his window-catch that he'd tinkered up one day
and we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring
and then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream
my man bent down his head and said, "little woman, you've saved my life
the worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam
from the sun that has shone so brightly since, on joe and his happy
there sat two glasses filled to the brim
on a rich man's table, rim to rim
one was ruddy and red as blood
and one was clear as the crystal flood
said the glass of wine to his paler brother
i can tell of banquet and revel and mirth
where i was king, for i ruled in might
for the proudest and grandest souls of earth
fell under my touch, as though struck with blight
from the heads of kings i have torn the crown
from the heights of fame i have hurled men down
i have blasted many an honored name
i have taken virtue and given shame
i have tempted youth with a sip, a taste
that has made his future a barren waste
or than any army beneath the sky
i have made the arm of the driver fail
and sent the train from the iron rail
i have made good ships go down at sea
and the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me
fame, strength, wealth, genius before me fall
and my might and power are over all
ho, ho, pale brother," said the wine
said the water glass: "i cannot boast
of a king dethroned, or a murdered host
but i can tell of hearts that were sad
by my crystal drops made bright and glad
of thirsts i have quenched and brows i have laved
of hands i have cooled, and souls i have saved
i have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain
slipped from the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain
i have burst my cloud-fetters, and dropped from the sky
and everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye
i have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain
i have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain
i can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill
that ground out the flour, and turned at my will
i can tell of manhood debased by you
that i have uplifted and crowned anew
i cheer, i help, i strengthen and aid
i gladden the heart of man and maid
i set the wine-chained captive free
and all are better for knowing me
these are the tales they told each other
the glass of wine, and its paler brother
as they sat together, filled to the brim
on a rich man's table, rim to rim
london "punch
broad for the self-complacent british sneer
his length of shambling limb, his furrowed face
his gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair
his garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease
his lack of all we prize as debonair
of power or will to shine, of art to please
judging each step, as though the way were plain
reckless, so it could point its paragraph
of chief's perplexity, or people's pain
beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet
the stars and stripes he lived to rear anew
between the mourners at his head and feet
say, scurril jester, is there room for you
yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer
to lame my pencil and confute my pen
to make me own this hind, of princes peer
this rail-splitter, a true-born king of men
my shallow judgment i had learned to rue
noting how to occasion's height he rose
how his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true
how, iron-like, his temper grew by blows
how humble, yet how hopeful he could be
how in good fortune and in ill the same
nor bitter in success, nor boastful he
thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame
he went about his work--such work as few
ever had laid on head, and heart, and hand
as one who knows where there's a task to do
man's honest will must heaven's good grace command
who trusts the strength will with the burden grow
that god makes instruments to work his will
if but that will we can arrive to know
nor tamper with the weights of good and ill
so he went forth to battle, on the side
that he felt clear was liberty's and right's
as in his peasant boyhood he had plied
his warfare with rude nature's thwarting mights
the uncleared forest, the unbroken soil
the iron bark that turns the lumberer's axe
the rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil
the prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks
the ambushed indian and the prowling bear
such were the needs that helped his youth to train
rough culture--but such trees large fruit may bear
if but their stocks be of right girth and grain
so he grew up, a destined work to do
and lived to do it: four long, suffering years
ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through
and then he heard the hisses change to cheers
the taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise
and took both with the same unwavering mood
till, as he came on light, from darkling days
and seemed to touch the goal from where he stood
a felon hand, between the goal and him
beached from behind his back, a trigger prest
and those perplexed and patient eyes were dim
those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest
the words of mercy were upon his lips
forgiveness in his heart and on his pen
when this vile murderer brought swift eclipse
to thoughts of peace on earth, goodwill to men
the old world and the new, from sea to sea
utter one voice of sympathy and shame
sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high
sad life, cut short as its triumph came
somewhat back from the village street
stands the old-fashioned country-seat
across its antique portico
tall poplar trees their shadows throw
and, from its station in the hall
an ancient timepiece says to all
never--forever
half-way up the stairs it stands
and points and beckons with its hands
from its case of massive oak
like a monk who, under his cloak
crosses himself, and sighs, alas
with sorrowful voice to all who pass
never--forever
by day its voice is low and light
but in the silent dead of night
distinct as a passing footstep's fall
it echoes along the vacant hall
along the ceiling, along the floor
and seems to say at each chamber door
never--forever
through days of sorrow and of mirth
through days of death and days of birth
through every swift vicissitude
of changeful time, unchanged it has stood
and as if, like god, it all things saw
it calmly repeats those words of awe
never--forever
in that mansion used to be
free-hearted hospitality
his great fires up the chimney roared
the stranger feasted at his board
but, like the skeleton at the feast
that warning timepiece never ceased
never--forever
there groups of merry children played
there youths and maidens dreaming strayed
oh, precious hours! oh, golden prime
and affluence of love and time
even as a miser counts his gold
those hours the ancient timepiece told
never--forever
from that chamber, clothed in white
the bride came forth on her wedding night
there, in that silent room below
the dead lay, in his shroud of snow
and, in the hush that followed the prayer
was heard the old clock on the stair
never--forever
all are scattered, now, and fled
some are married, some are dead
and when i ask, with throbs of pain
as in the days long since gone by
the ancient timepiece makes reply
never-forever
never here, forever there
where all parting, pain, and care
and death, and time, shall disappear
forever there, but never here
the horologe of eternity
sayeth this incessantly
never--forever
we had forgotten you, or very nearly
you did not seem to touch us very nearly
of course we thought about you now and then
especially in any time of trouble
we knew that you were good in time of trouble
but we were very ordinary men
and there were always other things to think of
there's lots of things a man has got to think of
his work, his home, his pleasure, and his wife
and so we only thought of you on sunday
sometimes, perhaps, not even on a sunday
because there's always lots to fill one's life
and, all the while, in street or lane or byway
in country lane, in city street, or byway
you walked among us, and we did  not see
your feet were bleeding as you walked our pavements
how did we miss your footprints on our pavements
can there be other folk as blind as we
now we remember; over here in flanders
this hideous warfare seems to make things clear
we never thought about you much in england
but now that we are far away from england
we have no doubts, we know that you are here
you helped us pass the jest along the trenches
where, in cold blood, we waited in the trenches
you touched its ribaldry and made it fine
you stood beside us in our pain and weakness
we're glad to think you understand our weakness
somehow it seems to help us not to whine
we think about you kneeling in the garden
ah, god, the agony of that dread garden
we know you prayed for us upon the cross
if anything could make us glad to bear it
pain--death--the uttermost of human loss
though we forgot you--you will not forget us
we feel so sure that you will not forget us
but stay with us until this dream is past
and so we ask for courage, strength, and pardon
especially, i think, we ask for pardon
and that you'll stand beside us to the last
that lightly draws its breath
and feels its life in every limb
what should it know of death
i met a little cottage girl
she was eight years old, she said
her hair was thick with many a curl
that clustered round her head
she had a rustic, woodland air
and she was wildly clad
her eyes were fair, and very fair
how many may you be
and wondering looked at me
she answered, "seven are we
and two of us at conway dwell
and two are gone to sea
my sister and my brother
dwell near them with my mother
and two are gone to sea
yet ye are seven!--i pray you tell
sweet maid, how this may be
then did the little maid reply
two of us in the church-yard lie
beneath the church-yard tree
your limbs they are alive
if two are in the church-yard laid
then ye are only five
the little maid replied
and they are side by side
my kerchief there i hem
and there upon the ground i sit
and sing a song to them
when it is light and fair
i take my little porringer
and eat my supper there
in bed she moaning lay
till god released her of her pain
and then she went away
and, when the grass was dry
together round her grave we played
and i could run and slide
my brother john was forced to go
and he lies by her side
quick was the little maid's reply
their spirits are in heaven
the little maid would have her will
and said, "nay, we are seven
what to a novice she could say
of courtship, love and matrimony
quoth echo plainly,--'matter-o'-money
a dashing damsel, gay and pert
a pattern of inconstancy
or selfish, mercenary flirt
quoth echo, sharply,--'nary flirt
that long has lured the dear deceiver
she promise to amend her life
and sin no more; can i believe her
quoth echo, very promptly,--'leave her
on me should venture to bestow it
pray should i act the wiser part
to take the treasure or forego it
quoth echo, with decision,--'go it
to bind her fate in hymen's fetter
she vow she means to die a maid
in answer to my loving letter
quoth echo, rather coolly,-'let her
i find my heart entwined about
with cupid's dear, delicious chain
so closely that i can't get out
quoth echo, laughingly,--'get out
as pure and fair as heaven can make her
will share my labor and my rest
till envious death shall overtake her
quoth echo (sotto voce),--'take her
it's noon when thirty-five is due
an' she comes on time like a flash of light
an' you hear her whistle "too-tee-too
long 'fore the pilot swings in sight
bill madden's drivin' her in to-day
an' he's calling his sweetheart far away
gertrude hurd lives down by the mill
you might see her blushin'; she knows it's bill
six-five, a.m. there's a local comes
makes up at bristol, runnin' east
an' the way her whistle sings and hums
is a livin' caution to man and beast
every one knows who jack white calls
little lou woodbury, down by the falls
summer or winter, always the same
she hears her lover callin' her name
but at one fifty-one, old sixty-four
boston express, runs east, clear through
drowns her rattle and rumble and roar
with the softest whistle that ever blew
an' away on the furthest edge of town
sweet sue winthrop's eyes of brown
shine like the starlight, bright and clear
when she hears the whistle of abel gear
along at midnight a freight comes in
leaves berlin sometime--i don't know when
but it rumbles along with a fearful din
till it reaches the y-switch there and then
the clearest notes of the softest bell
that out of a brazen goblet fell
wake nellie minton out of her dreams
to her like a wedding-bell it seems
tom willson rides on the right-hand side
givin' her steam at every stride
an' he touches the whistle, low an' clear
for lulu gray on the hill, to hear
so it goes all day an' all night
till the old folks have voted the thing a bore
old maids and bachelors say it ain't right
for folks to do courtin' with such a roar
but the engineers their kisses will blow
from a whistle valve to the girls they know
an' stokers the name of their sweethearts tell
with the "too-too-too" and the swinging bell
she stood at the bar of justice
a creature wan and wild
in form too small for a woman
in features too old for a child
for a look so worn and pathetic
was stamped on her pale young face
it seemed long years of suffering
must have left that silent trace
with kindly look yet keen
and your age?"--"i am turned fifteen
he slowly and gravely read
with stealing three loaves of bread
and i hope that you can show
the charge to be false. now, tell me
are you guilty of this, or no
a passionate burst of weeping
was at first her sole reply
but she dried her eyes in a moment
and looked in the judge's eye
my father and mother are dead
and my little brothers and sisters
were hungry and asked me for bread
at first i earned it for them
by working hard all day
but somehow, times were bad, sir
and the work all fell away
the weather was bitter cold
the young ones cried and shivered
so what was i to do, sir
i am guilty, but do not condemn
i _took_--oh, was it _stealing
the bread to give to them
every man in the court-room
gray-beard and thoughtless youth
knew, as he looked upon her
that the prisoner spake the truth
out from their pockets came kerchiefs
out from their eyes sprung tears
and out from their old faded wallets
treasures hoarded for years
the judge's face was a study
the strangest you ever saw
as he cleared his throat and murmured
for one so learned in such matters
so wise in dealing with men
he seemed, on a simple question
sorely puzzled, just then
but no one blamed him or wondered
when at last these words he heard
is, for the present, deferred
and no one blamed him or wondered
when he went to her and smiled
and tenderly led from the court-room
himself, the "guilty" child
where did you come from, baby dear
where did you get your eyes so blue
what makes the light in them sparkle and spin
where did you get that little tear
what makes your forehead so smooth and high
what makes your cheek like a warm white rose
whence that three-cornered smile of bliss
where did you get that pearly ear
where did you get those arms and hands
feet, whence did you come, you darling things
how did they all just come to be you
but how did you come to us, you dear
the sea! the sea! the open sea
the blue, the fresh, the ever free
without a mark, without a bound
it runneth the earth's wide regions round
it plays with the clouds; it mocks the skies
or like a cradled creature lies
i'm on the sea! i'm on the sea
i am where i would ever be
with the blue above and the blue below
and silence wheresoe'er i go
if a storm should come and awake the deep
what matter? _i_ shall ride and sleep
i love, oh, how i love to ride
on the fierce, foaming, bursting tide
when every mad wave drowns the moon
or whistles aloud his tempest tune
and tells how goeth the world below
and why the southwest blasts do blow
i never was on the dull, tame shore
but i loved the great sea more and more
and back i flew to her billowy breast
like a bird that seeketh its mother's nest
and a mother she _was_, and _is_, to me
for i was born on the open sea
i've lived, since then, in calm and strife
full fifty summers a sailor's life
with wealth to spend and a power to range
but never have sought nor sighed for change
and death, whenever he comes to me
shall come on the wild, unbounded sea
and here he paused a while
to fringe his words the merest mite
with something of a smile
a smile that found its image
in a face of beauteous mold
whose liquid eyes were peeping
from a broidery of gold
if--" then he stopped again
as if his heart had bubbled o'er
and overflowed his brain
his lips were twitching nervously
o'er what they had to tell
and timed the quavers with the eyes
that gently rose and fell
and held them in his own
that on her cheeks had blown
the throbbing of her heart
that told how love had entered in
and claimed its every part
with just the faintest sigh
but what's the reason why
forbore its sweets to tell
has any pigs to sell
slowly england's sun was setting o'er the hilltops far away
filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day
and the last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden fair
he with footsteps slow and weary, she with sunny floating hair
he with bowed head, sad and thoughtful, she with lips all cold and white
struggling to keep back the murmur, "curfew must not ring to-night
with its turrets tall and gloomy, with its walls dark, damp and cold
at the ringing of the curfew, and no earthly help is nigh
cromwell will not come till sunset," and her lips grew strangely white
as she breathed the husky whisper: "curfew must not ring to-night
like the piercing of an arrow, like a deadly poisoned dart
every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight hour
i have done my duty ever, tried to do it just and right
now i'm old i will not falter,--curfew, it must ring to-night
wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thoughtful brow
as within her secret bosom bessie made a solemn vow
she had listened while the judges read without a tear or sigh
and her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and bright
in an undertone she murmured, "curfew must not ring to-night
with quick step she bounded forward, sprung within the old church door
left the old man treading slowly paths so oft he'd trod before
not one moment paused the maiden, but with eye and cheek aglow
mounted up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro
as she climbed the dusty ladder on which fell no ray of light
up and up,--her white lips saying: "curfew must not ring to-night
she has reached the topmost ladder; o'er her hangs the great, dark bell
awful is the gloom beneath her, like the pathway down to hell
lo, the ponderous tongue is swinging--'tis the hour of curfew now
and the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath and paled her brow
shall she let it ring? no, never! flash her eyes with sudden light
as she springs and grasps it firmly--"curfew shall not ring to-night
out she swung--far out; the city seemed a speck of light below
there 'twixt heaven and earth suspended as the bell swung to and fro
and the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell
sadly thought, "that twilight curfew rang young basil's funeral knell
still the maiden clung more firmly, and with trembling lips so white
said, to hush her heart's wild throbbing: "curfew shall not ring to-night
it was o'er; the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped once more
firmly on the dark old ladder where, for hundred years before
human foot had not been planted. the brave deed that she had done
should be told long ages after; as the rays of setting sun
crimson all the sky with beauty, aged sires with heads of white
tell the eager, listening children, "curfew did not ring that night
o'er the distant hills came cromwell; bessie sees him, and her brow
lately white with fear and anguish, has no anxious traces now
at his feet she tells her story, shows her hands all bruised and torn
and her face so sweet and pleading, yet with sorrow pale and worn
touched his heart with sudden pity, lit his eyes with misty light
wide they flung the massive portal; led the prisoner forth to die
all his bright young life before him. 'neath the darkening english sky
bessie comes with flying footsteps, eyes aglow with love-light sweet
kneeling on the turf beside him, lays his pardon at his feet
in his brave, strong arms he clasped her, kissed the face upturned
and white
whispered, "darling, you have saved me--curfew will not ring to-night
have you heard how a girl saved the lightning express
of kate shelly, whose father was killed on the road
were he living to-day, he'd be proud to possess
such a daughter as kate. ah! 'twas grit that she showed
on that terrible evening when donahue's train
jumped the bridge and went down, in the darkness and rain
she was only eighteen, but a woman in size
with a figure as graceful and lithe as a doe
with peach-blossom cheeks, and with violet eyes
and teeth and complexion like new-fallen snow
with a nature unspoiled and unblemished by art
with a generous soul, and a warm, noble heart
men linger at home by their bright-blazing fires
the wind wildly howls with a horrible sound
and shrieks through the vibrating telegraph wires
the fierce lightning flashes along the dark sky
the rain falls in torrents; the river rolls by
the scream of a whistle; the rush of a train
the sound of a bell! a mysterious light
that flashes and flares through the fast falling rain
a rumble! a roar! shrieks of human affright
the falling of timbers! the space of a breath
a splash in the river; then darkness and death
kate shelly recoils at the terrible crash
the sounds of destruction she happens to hear
she springs to the window--she throws up the sash
and listens and looks with a feeling of fear
the tall tree-tops groan, and she hears the faint cry
of a drowning man down in the river near by
her heart feebly flutters, her features grow wan
and then through her soul in a moment there flies
a forethought that gives her the strength of a man
she turns to her trembling old mother and cries
then out through the door disappears in the shower
she flies down the track through the pitiless rain
she reaches the river--the water below
whirls and seethes through the timbers. she shudders again
then closely about her she gathers her gown
and on the wet ties with a shiver sinks down
then carefully over the timbers she creeps
on her hands and knees, almost holding her breath
the loud thunder peals and the wind wildly sweeps
and struggles to hurry her downward to death
but the thought of the train to destruction so near
removes from her soul every feeling of fear
with the blood dripping down from each torn, bleeding limb
slowly over the timbers her dark way she feels
her fingers grow numb and her head seems to swim
her strength is fast failing--she staggers! she reels
she falls--ah! the danger is over at last
her feet touch the earth, and the long bridge is passed
in an instant new life seems to come to her form
she springs to her feet and forgets her despair
on, on to moingona! she faces the storm
she reaches the station--the keeper is there
there's death on the bridge at the river to-night
out flashes the signal-light, rosy and red
then sounds the loud roar of the swift-coming train
the hissing of steam, and there, brightly ahead
the gleam of a headlight illumines the rain
she heeds the red signal--she slackens, she's still
ah! noble kate shelly, your mission is done
your deed that dark night will not fade from our gaze
an endless renown you have worthily won
let the nation be just, and accord you its praise
let your name, let your fame, and your courage declare
what a _woman_ can do, and a _woman_ can dare
an old wife sat by her bright fireside
swaying thoughtfully to and fro
in an easy chair, whose creaky craw
told a tale of long ago
while down by her side, on the kitchen floor
stood a basket of worsted balls--a score
the good man dozed o'er the latest news
till the light in his pipe went out
and, unheeded, the kitten with cunning paws
rolled and tangled the balls about
yet still sat the wife in the ancient chair
swaying to and fro in the fire-light glare
but anon, a misty teardrop came
in her eyes of faded blue
then trickled down in a furrow deep
like a single drop of dew
so deep was the channel--so silent the stream
that the good man saw naught but the dimmed eye-beam
yet marveled he much that the cheerful light
of her eye had heavy grown
and marveled he more at the tangled balls
so he said in a gentle tone
conceal not from me thy sorrows now
then she spoke of the time when the basket there
was filled to the very brim
and now, there remained of the goodly pile
but a single pair--for him
there's but one pair of stockings to mend to-night
whose wrappings were wont to lay
in the basket, awaiting the needle's time
now wandering so far away
how the sprightly steps to a mother dear
unheeded fell on the careless ear
by the hearth there's a vacant seat
and i miss the shadows from off the wall
and the patter of many feet
at the one pair of stockings to mend to-night
and over the mountains bold
was a land whose rivers and darkening caves
were gemmed with the rarest gold
then my first-born turned from the oaken door
and i knew the shadows were only four
and diminished the basket's store
but his feet grew cold--so weary and cold
they'll never be warm any more
and this nook, in its emptiness, seemeth to me
to give forth no voice but the moan of the sea
and made them a home in its light
and fairy fingers have taken their share
to mend by the fireside bright
some other baskets their garments will fill
but mine, ah, mine is emptier still
was taken by angels away
and clad in a garment that waxeth not old
in a land of continual day
oh! wonder no more at the dimmed eye-light
when i mend the one pair of stockings to-night
in the room below the young man sat
with an anxious face and a white cravat
a throbbing heart and a silken hat
and various other things like that
which he had accumulated
and the maid of his heart was up above
surrounded by hat and gown and glove
and a thousand things which women love
but no man knoweth the names thereof
and the young man sat and--waited
you will scarce believe the things i tell
but the truth thereof i know full well
though how may not be stated
but i swear to you that the maiden took
a sort of half-breed, thin stove-hook
and heated it well in the gaslight there
and thrust it into her head, or hair
then she took something off the bed
and hooked it onto her hair, or head
and piled it high, and piled it higher
and drove it home with staples of wire
and the young man anxiously--waited
then she took a thing she called a "puff
and some very peculiar whitish stuff
and using about a half a peck
she spread it over her face and neck
and she looked as fair as a lilied bower
or a pound of lard or a sack of flour
and the young man wearily--waited
then she took a garment of awful shape
and it wasn't a waist, nor yet a cape
but it looked like a piece of ancient mail
or an instrument from a russian jail
and then with a fearful groan and gasp
she squeezed herself in its deathly clasp
so fair and yet so fated
and then with a move like i don't know what
she tied it on with a double knot
and the young man wofully--waited
then she put on a dozen different things
a mixture of buttons and hooks and strings
till she strongly resembled a notion store
then, taking some seventeen pins or more
she thrust them into her ruby lips
then stuck them around from waist to hips
and never once hesitated
and the maiden didn't know, perhaps
that the man below had had seven naps
and that now he sleepily--waited
and then she tried to put on her hat
ah me, a trying ordeal was that
she tipped it high and she tried it low
but every way that the thing would go
only made her more agitated
it wouldn't go straight and it caught her hair
and she wished she could hire a man to swear
but alas, the only man lingering there
was the one who wildly--waited
and then before she could take her leave
she had to puff up her monstrous sleeve
then a little dab here and a wee pat there
and a touch or two to her hindmost hair
then around the room with the utmost care
she thoughtfully circulated
then she seized her gloves and a chamoiskin
some breath perfume and a long stickpin
a bonbon box and a cloak and some
eau-de-cologne and chewing-gum
her opera glass and sealskin muff
a fan and a heap of other stuff
then she hurried down, but ere she spoke
something about the maiden broke
so she scurried back to the winding stair
and the young man looked in wild despair
and then he--evaporated
out of the night that covers me
black as the pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul
in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of chance
my head is bloody, but unbowed
beyond this place of wrath and tears
looms but the horror of the shade
and yet the menace of the years
finds, and shall find, me unafraid
it matters not how strait the gate
how charged with punishments the scroll
i am the master of my fate
i am the captain of my soul
two brown heads with tossing curls
red lips shutting over pearls
bare feet, white and wet with dew
two eyes black, and two eyes blue
little girl and boy were they
katie lee and willie grey
they were standing where a brook
bending like a shepherd's crook
flashed its silver, and thick ranks
of willow fringed its mossy banks
half in thought, and half in play
katie lee and willie grey
they had cheeks like cherries red
he was taller--'most a head
she, with arms like wreaths of snow
swung a basket to and fro
as she loitered, half in play
chattering to willie grey
and there came a dash of red
through the brownness of his cheek
and i'll carry, so i will
katie's basket up the hill
katie answered with a laugh
and then, tossing back her curls
do you think that katie guessed
half the wisdom she expressed
men are only boys grown tall
hearts don't change much, after all
and when, long years from that day
katie lee and willie grey
stood again beside the brook
bending like a shepherd's crook
is it strange that willie said
while again a dash of red
crossed the brownness of his cheek
life is but a slippery steep
hung with shadows cold and deep
walk beside me without fear
may i carry, if i will
all your burdens up the hill
and she answered, with a laugh
close beside the little brook
bending like a shepherd's crook
washing with its silver hands
late and early at the sands
is a cottage, where to-day
katie lives with willie grey
in a porch she sits, and lo
swings a basket to and fro
vastly different from the one
that she swung in years agone

abou ben adhem--may his tribe increase
awoke one night from a deep dream of peace
and saw, within the moonlight in his room
making it rich, and like a lily in bloom
an angel, writing in a book of gold
exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold
and to the presence in the room he said
and, with a look made all of sweet accord
answered, "the names of those who love the lord
replied the angel.--abou spoke more low
but cheerily still; and said, "i pray thee, then
write me as one that loves his fellow-men
the angel wrote, and vanished. the next night
it came again, with a great wakening light
and showed the names whom love of god had blessed
and, lo! ben adhem's name led all the rest
still sits the school-house by the road
a ragged beggar sunning
around it still the sumachs grow
and blackberry vines are running
within, the master's desk is seen
deep scarred by raps official
the warping floor, the battered seats
the jack-knife's carved initial
the charcoal frescoes on its wall
its door's worn sill, betraying
the feet that, creeping slow to school
went storming out to playing
long years ago a winter sun
shone over it at setting
lit up its western window-panes
and low eaves' icy fretting
it touched the tangled golden curls
and brown eyes full of grieving
of one who still her steps delayed
when all the school were leaving
for near her stood the little boy
her childish favor singled
his cap pulled low upon a face
where pride and shame were mingled
pushing with restless feet the snow
to right and left, he lingered
as restlessly her tiny hands
the blue-checked apron fingered
he saw her lift her eyes; he felt
the soft hand's light caressing
and heard the tremble of her voice
as if a fault confessing
i hate to go above you
because,"--the brown eyes lower fell
still memory to a gray-haired man
that sweet child-face is showing
dear girl: the grasses on her grave
have forty years been growing
he lives to learn, in life's hard school
how few who pass above him
lament their triumph and his loss
like her,--because they love him
they were never made to handle a hoe
and at once to a college ought to go
there's fred, he's little better than a fool
but john and henry must go to school
as he set his mug of cider down
than both his brothers do in three
book larnin' will never plant one's corn
nor hoe potatoes, sure's you're born
nor mend a rod of broken fence
for my part, give me common sense
but his wife was bound the roost to rule
and john and henry were sent to school
while fred, of course, was left behind
because his mother said he had no mind
five years at school the students spent
then into business each one went
john learned to play the flute and fiddle
and parted his hair, of course, in the middle
while his brother looked rather higher than he
meanwhile, at home, their brother fred
had taken a notion into his head
but he quietly trimmed his apple trees
and weeded onions and planted peas
while somehow or other, by hook or crook
he managed to read full many a book
until at last his father said
he was getting "book larnin'" into his head
the war broke out, and captain fred
a hundred men to battle led
and when the rebel flag came down
went marching home as general brown
but he went to work on the farm again
and planted corn and sowed his grain
he shingled the barn and mended the fence
till people declared he had common sense
now common sense was very rare
and the state house needed a portion there
so the "family dunce" moved into town
the people called him governor brown
and the brothers who went to the city school
came home to live with "mother's fool

god give us men; a time like this demands
strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands
men whom the lust of office cannot kill
men whom the spoils of office cannot buy
men who possess opinions and a will
men who have honor; men who will not lie
men who can stand before a demagogue
and brave his treacherous flatteries without winking
tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog
in public duty and in private thinking
for while the rabble, with its thumb-worn creeds
its large professions, and its little deeds
mingle in selfish strife--lo! freedom weeps
wrong rules the land, and waiting justice sleeps
my good man is a clever man, which no one will gainsay
he lies awake to plot and plan 'gainst lions in the way
while i, without a thought of ill, sleep sound enough for three
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me
a holiday we never fix but he is sure 'twill rain
and when the sky is clear at six he knows it won't remain
he is always prophesying ill to which i won't agree
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me
the wheat will never show a top--but soon how green the field
we will not harvest half a crop--yet have a famous yield
it will not sell, it never will! but i will wait and see
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me
we have a good share of worldly gear, and fortune seems secure
yet my good man is full of fear--misfortune's coming sure
he points me out the almshouse hill, but cannot make me see
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me
he has a sort of second sights and when the fit is strong
he sees beyond the good and right the evil and the wrong
heaven's cop of joy he'll surely spill unless i with him be
for i never trouble trouble till trouble troubles me

there's a funny tale 'of a stingy man
who was none too good but might have been worse
who went to his church, on a sunday night
and carried along his well-filled purse
when the sexton came with the begging plate
the church was but dim with the candle's light
the stingy man fumbled all thro' his purse
and chose a coin by touch and not by sight
it's an odd thing now that guineas should be
so like unto pennies in shape and size
the penny fell down with a clatter and ring
and back in his seat leaned the stingy man
ha! ha! how the sexton smiled, to be sure
to see the gold guinea fall in the plate
ha! ha! how the stingy man's heart was wrung
perceiving his blunder--but just too late
that guinea of gold is set down to me
they lend to him who give to the poor
it will not so bad an investment be
he knew it was only by accident
that out o' thy fingers the guinea fell
but in that account he'll set down to thee
na mair o' that golden guinea, my mon
than the one bare penny ye mean to gie
there's comfort, too, in the little tale
a serious side as well as a joke
a comfort for all the generous poor
in the comical words the sexton spoke
a comfort to think that the good lord knows
how generous we really desire to be
and will give us credit in his account
for all the pennies we long "to gie

we shall be so kind in the after while

my name is tommy, an' i hates
that feller of my sister kate's
he's bigger'n i am an' you see
he's sorter lookin' down on me
an' i resents it with a vim
i think i am just as good as him
he's older, an' he's mighty fly
one time he came,--down by the gate
i guess it must have been awful late
an' katie, she was there, an' they
was feelin' very nice and gay
an' he was talkin' all the while
about her sweet an' lovin' smile
an' everythin' was as nice as pie
they didn't see me, 'cause i slid
down underneath a bush, an' hid
an' he was sayin' that his love
was greater'n all the stars above
up in the glorious heavens placed
an' then his arms got 'round her waist
an' clouds were floatin' in the sky
i didn't hear just all they said
but by an' by my sister's head
was droopin' on his shoulder, an
i seen him holdin' katie's hand
an' then he hugged her closer, some
an' then i heerd a kiss--yum, yum
an' katie blushed an' drew a sigh
an' then that feller looked around
an' seed me there, down on the ground
an'--was he mad? well, betcher boots
i gets right out of there an' scoots
an' he just left my sister kate
a-standin' right there by the gate
an' i seen blood was in his eye
i runned the very best i could
but he cotched up--i's 'fraid he would
an' then he said he'd teach me how
to know my manners, he'd allow
an' then he shaked me awful. gee
he jest--he frashed the ground with me
an' then he stopped it by and by
an' then he went back to the gate
an' couldn't find my sister kate
was runnin' 'round an' thumpin' me
i got round in a shadder dim
an' made a face, an' guffed at him
an' then the moon larfed, in the sky
is it worth while that we jostle a brother
bearing his load on the rough road of life
is it worth while that we jeer at each other
in blackness of heart that we war to the knife
god pity us all in our pitiful strife
god pity as all as we jostle each other
god pardon us all for the triumph we feel
when a fellow goes down 'neath his load on the heather
pierced to the heart: words are keener than steel
and mightier far for woe than for weal
were it not well, in this brief little journey
on over the isthmus, down into the tide
we give him a fish instead of a serpent
ere folding the hands to be and abide
forever and aye in dust at his side
look at the roses saluting each other
look at the herds all at peace on the plain
man, and man only, makes war on his brother
and laughs in his heart at his peril and pain
shamed by the beasts that go down on the plain
is it worth while that we battle to humble
some poor fellow down into the dust
god pity us all! time too soon will tumble
all of us together, like leaves in a gust
humbled, indeed, down into the dust
there are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave
there are souls that are pure and true
then give to the world the best you have
and the best will come back to you
give love, and love to your life will flow
a strength in your utmost need
have faith, and a score of hearts will show
their faith in your work and deed
give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind
and honor will honor meet
and the smile which is sweet will surely find
a smile that is just as sweet
give pity and sorrow to those who mourn
you will gather in flowers again
the scattered seeds from your thought outborne
though the sowing seemed in vain
for life is the mirror of king and slave
then give to the world the best you have
and the best will come back to you
a boy drove into the city, his wagon loaded down
with food to feed the people of the british-governed town
and the little black-eyed rebel, so cunning and so sly
was watching for his coming from the corner of her eye
his face was broad and honest, his hands were brown and tough
the clothes he wore upon him were homespun, coarse, and rough
but one there was who watched him, who long time lingered nigh
and cast at him sweet glances from the corner of her eye
he drove up to the market, he waited in the line
his apples and potatoes were fresh and fair and fine
but long and long he waited, and no one came to buy
save the black-eyed rebel, watching from the corner of her eye
and, "who wants my potatoes?" he repeated to the crowd
but from all the people round him came no word of reply
save the black-eyed rebel, answering from the corner of her eye
for she knew that 'neath the lining of the coat he wore that day
were long letters from the husbands and the fathers far away
who were fighting for the freedom that they meant to gain, or die
and a tear like silver glistened in the corner of her eye
but the treasures--how to get them? crept the question through her mind
since keen enemies were watching for what prizes they might find
and she paused a while and pondered, with a pretty little sigh
then resolve crept through her features, and a shrewdness fired her eye
so she resolutely walked up to the wagon old and red
and the brown face flushed to scarlet, for the boy was somewhat shy
and he saw her laughing at him from the corner of her eye
and she clambered on the wagon, minding not who all were by
with a laugh of reckless romping in the corner of her eye
clinging round his brawny neck, she clasped her fingers white and small
and then whispered, "quick! the letters! thrust them underneath my shawl
carry back again _this_ package, and be sure that you are spry
and she sweetly smiled upon him from the corner of her eye
loud the motley crowd was laughing at the strange, ungirlish freak
and the boy was scared and panting, and so dashed he could not speak
and "miss, i have good apples," a bolder lad did cry
but she answered, "no, i thank you," from the corner of her eye
with the news from loved ones absent to the dear friends they would greet
searching them who hungered for them, swift she glided through the street
thought the little black-eyed rebel with a twinkle in her eye
if you sit down at set of sun
and count the deeds that you have done
and, counting, find
one self-denying act, one word that eased the heart of him that heard
one glance most kind, which felt like sunshine where it went
then you may count that day well spent
but if through, all the livelong day
you've eased no heart by yea or nay
if through it all you've nothing done that you can trace
that brought the sunshine to one face
no act most small that helped some soul and nothing cost
then count that day as worse than lost
say not the struggle nought availeth
the labor and the wounds are vain
the enemy faints not, nor faileth
and as things have been they remain
if hopes were dupes, fears may be liars
it may be, in yon smoke concealed
your comrades chase e'en now the fliers
and, but for you, possess the field
for while the tired waves, vainly breaking
seem here no painful inch to gain
far back, through creeks and inlets making
comes silent, flooding in, the main
and not by eastern windows only
when daylight comes, comes in the light
in front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly
but westward, look, the land is bright
there dwelt a miller, hale and bold
beside the river dee
he worked and sang from morn till night
no lark more blithe than he
and this the burden of his song
forever used to be
and nobody envies me
for could my heart be light as thine
i'd gladly change with thee
and tell me now, what makes thee sing
with voice so loud and free
while i am sad, though i'm a king
beside the river dee
the miller smiled and doffed his cap
i love my children three
i owe no penny i cannot pay
i thank the river dee
that turns the mill that grinds the corn
that feeds my babes and me
but say no more, if thou'dst be true
that no one envies thee
thy mealy cap is worth my crown
thy mill my kingdom's fee
such men as thou art england's boast
o miller of the dee
take me back to the days when the old red cradle rocked
in the sunshine of the years that are gone
to the good old trusty days, when the door was never locked
and we slumbered unmolested till the dawn
i remember of my years i had numbered almost seven
and the old cradle stood against the wall
i was youngest of the five, and two were gone to heaven
but the old red cradle rocked us all
and if ever came a day when my cheeks were flushed and hot
when i did not mind my porridge or my play
i would clamber up its side and the pain would be forgot
when the old red cradle rocked away
it has been a hallowed spot where i've turned through all the years
which have brought me the evil with the good
and i turn again to-night, aye, and see it through my tears
the place where the dear old cradle stood
by its side my father paused with a little time to spare
and the care-lines would soften on his brow
ah! 't was but a little while that i knew a father's care
but i fancy in my dreams i see him now
by my mother it was rocked when the evening meal was laid
and again i seem to see her as she smiled
when the rest were all in bed, 'twas there she knelt and prayed
by the old red cradle and her child
aye, it cradled one and all, brothers, sisters in it lay
and it gave me the sweetest rest i've known
but to-night the tears will flow, and i let them have their way
for the passing years are leaving me alone
and it seems of those to come, i would gladly give them all
for a slumber as free from care as then
just to wake to-morrow morn where the rising sun would fall
round the old red cradle once again
but the cradle long has gone and the burdens that it bore
one by one, have been gathered to the fold
still the flock is incomplete, for it numbers only four
with one left out straying in the cold
heaven grant again we may in each other's arms be locked
where no sad tears of parting ever fall
god forbid that one be lost that the old red cradle rocked
and the dear old cradle rocked us all
my papa held me up to the moo cow moo
so close i could almost touch
and i fed him a couple of times or so
and i wasn't a fraid-cat, much
but if my papa goes in the house
and my mamma she goes in too
i keep still like a little mouse
for the moo cow moo might moo
the moo cow's tail is a piece of rope
all raveled out where it grows
and it's just like feeling a piece of soap
all over the moo cow's nose
and the moo cow moo has lots of fun
just switching his tail about
but if he opens his mouth, why then i run
for that's where the moo comes out
the moo cow moo has deers on his head
and his eyes stick out of their place
and the nose of the moo cow moo is spread
all over the moo cow's face
and his feet are nothing but fingernails
and his mamma don't keep them cut
and he gives folks milk in water pails
when he don't keep his handles shut
but if you or i pull his handles, why
the moo cow moo says it hurts
but the hired man sits down close by
and squirts, and squirts, and squirts
all things bright and beautiful
all creatures great and small
all things wise and wonderful
the lord god made them all
each little flower that opens
each little bird that sings
he made their glowing colors
he made their tiny wings
the rich man in his castle
the poor man at his gate
god made them, high or lowly
and ordered their estate
the purple-headed mountain
the river running by
the morning, and the sunset
that lighteth up the sky
the cold wind in the winter
the pleasant summer sun
the ripe fruits in the garden
he made them, every one
the tall trees in the greenwood
the meadows where we play
the rushes by the water
we gather every day
he gave us eyes to see them
and lips that we might tell
how great is god almighty
who hath made all things well
oh, good painter, tell me true
has your hand the cunning to draw
shapes of things that you never saw
aye? well, here is an order for you
woods and cornfields, a little brown
the picture must not be over-bright
yet all in the golden and gracious light
of a cloud, when the summer sun is down
alway and alway, night and morn
woods upon woods, with fields of corn
lying between them, not quite sere
and not in the full, thick, leafy bloom
when the wind can hardly find breathing-room
under their tassels,--cattle near
biting shorter the short green grass
and a hedge of sumach and sassafras
with bluebirds twittering all around
these, and the little house where i was born
low and little, and black and old
with children, many as it can hold
all at the windows, open wide
heads and shoulders clear outside
and fair young faces all ablush
perhaps you have seen, some day
roses crowding the self-same way
out of a wilding, wayside bush
listen closer. when you have done
with woods and cornfields and grazing herds
a lady, the loveliest ever the sun
looked down upon you must paint for me
oh, if i could only make you see
the clear blue eyes, the tender smile
the sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace
the woman's soul, and the angel's face
that are beaming on me all the while
i need not speak these foolish words
yet one word tells you all i would say
she is my mother: you will agree
that all the rest may be thrown away
two little urchins at her knee
you must paint, sir: one like me
the other with a clearer brow
and the light of his adventurous eyes
flashing with boldest enterprise
at ten years old he went to sea
god knoweth if he be living now
he sailed in the good ship "commodore
nobody ever crossed her track
to bring us news, and she never came back
ah, it is twenty long years and more
since that old ship went out of the bay
with my great-hearted brother on her deck
i watched him till he shrank to a speck
and his face was toward me all the way
bright his hair was, a golden brown
the time we stood at our mother's knee
that beauteous head, if it did go down
carried sunshine into the sea
out in the fields one summer night
we were together, half afraid
of the corn-leaves' rustling, and of the shade
of the high hills, stretching so still and far
loitering till after the low little light
of the candle shone through the open door
and over the hay-stack's pointed top
all of a tremble and ready to drop
the first half-hoar, the great yellow star
that we, with staring, ignorant eyes
had often and often watched to see
propped and held in its place in the skies
by the fork of a tall red mulberry-tree
which close in the edge of our flax-field grew
dead at the top, just one branch full
of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool
from which it tenderly shook the dew
over our heads, when we came to play
in its hand-breadth of shadow, day after day
afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore
a nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs
the other, a bird, held fast by the legs
not so big as a straw of wheat
the berries we gave her she wouldn't eat
but cried and cried, till we held her bill
so slim and shining, to keep her still
at last we stood at our mother's knee
do you think, sir, if you try
you can paint the look of a lie
if you can, pray have the grace
to put it solely in the face
of the urchin that is likest me
i think 'twas solely mine, indeed
but that's no matter,--paint it so
the eyes of our mother--(take good heed
looking not on the nestful of eggs
nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs
but straight through our faces down to our lies
and, oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise
i felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though
a sharp blade struck through it
you, sir, know
that you on the canvas are to repeat
things that are fairest, things most sweet
woods and cornfields and mulberry-tree
the mother,--the lads, with their bird at her knee
but, oh, that look of reproachful woe
high as the heavens your name i'll shout
if you paint me the picture, and leave that out
who won the war
of ruthless hordes who thought to ride
her borders through and prostrate france
ere yet she'd time to raise her lance
who won the war
italia broke the galling chain
which bound her to the guilty twain
then fought 'gainst odds till one of these
lay prone and shattered at her knees
who won the war
old england's watch dogs of the main
their vigil kept, and not in vain
for not a ship their wrath dared brave
save those which skulked beneath the wave
who won the war
the grandest words on history's page
and he could never pass verdun
who won the war
in darkest hour there rose a cry
thank god! they came across the sea
two million men and victory
who won the war
no one of these; not one, but all
who answered freedom's clarion call
each humble man who did his bit
in god's own book of fame is writ
these won the war
the bravest battle that ever was fought
shall i tell you where and when
on the map of the world you will find it not
nay, not with cannon or battle shot
with sword or nobler pen
nay, not with eloquent words or thought
from mouths of wonderful men
but deep in the walled-up woman's heart
of woman that would not yield
but bravely, silently, bore her part
lo, there is the battle field
no marshaling troup, no bivouac song
no banner to gleam or wave
but oh, these battles, they last so long
from babyhood to the grave
yet, faithful as a bridge of stars
she fights in her walled-up town
fights on and on in the endless wars
then, silent, unseen, goes down
oh, ye with banner and battle shot
and soldiers to shout and praises
i tell you the kingliest victories fought
were fought in those silent ways
oh, spotless in a world of shame
with splendid and silent scorn
go back to god as white as you came
the kingliest warrior born
bob went lookin' for a job
didn't want a situation; didn't ask a lofty station
didn't have a special mission for a topnotcher's position
didn't have such fine credentials--but he had the real essentials
had a head that kept on workin' and two hands that were not shirkin
wasn't either shirk or snob
wasn't mister--just plain bob
who was lookin' for a job
bob went lookin' for a job
and he wasn't scared or daunted when he saw a sign--"men wanted
walked right in with manner fittin' up to where the boss was sittin
and he said: "my name is bob, and i'm lookin' for a job
and if you're the boss that hires 'em, starts 'em working and that
fires 'em
put my name right down here, neighbor, as a candidate for labor
for my name is just plain 'bob
and my pulses sort o' throb
for that thing they call a job
bob kept askin' for a job
and the boss, he says: "what kind?" and bob answered:  "never mind
for i am not a bit partic'ler and i never was a stickler
for proprieties in workin'--if you got some labor lurkin
anywhere around about kindly go and trot it out
it's, a job i want, you see
any kind that there may be
will be good enough for me
well, sir, bob he got a job
but the boss went 'round all day in a dreamy sort of way
and he says to me: "by thunder, we have got the world's eighth wonder
got a feller name of bob who just asked me for a job
never asks when he engages about overtime in wages
never asked if he'd get pay by the hour or by the day
never asked me if it's airy work and light and sanitary
never asked me for my notion of the chances of promotion
never asked for the duration of his annual vacation
never asked for saturday half-a-holiday with pay
never took me on probation till he tried the situation
never asked me if it's sittin' work or standin', or befittin
of his birth and inclination--he just filed his application
hung his coat up on a knob
said his name was just plain bob
and went workin' at a job
whatever i do and whatever i say
aunt tabitha tells me it isn't the way
when _she_ was a girl (forty summers ago
aunt tabitha tells me they never did so
dear aunt! if i only would take her advice
but i like my own way, and i find it _so_ nice
and besides, i forget half the things i am told
but they all will come back to me--when i am old
if a youth passes by, it may happen, no doubt
he may chance to look in as i chance to look out
it is _horrid_, she says, and i mustn't sit there
a walk in the moonlight has pleasures, i own
but it isn't quite safe to be walking alone
so i take a lad's arm--just for safety you know
but aunt tabitha tells me _they_ didn't do so
how wicked we are, and how good they were then
they kept at arm's length those detestable men
what an era of virtue she lived in!--but stay
were the _men_ all such rogues in aunt tabitha's day
if the men _were_ so wicked, i'll ask my papa
how he dared to propose to my darling mamma
was he like the rest of them? goodness! who knows
and what shall _i_ say, if a wretch should propose
i am thinking if aunt knew so little of sin
what a wonder aunt tabitha's aunt must have been
and her grand-aunt--it scares me--how shockingly sad
that we girls of to-day are so frightfully bad
a martyr will save us, and nothing else can
let _me perish_--to rescue some wretched young man
though when to the altar a victim i go
aunt tabitha'll tell me _she_ never did so
hats off
along the street there comes
a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
a flash of color beneath the sky
hats off
the flag is passing by
blue and crimson and white it shines
over the steel-tipped, ordered lines
hats off
the colors before us fly
but more than the flag is passing by
sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great
fought to make and to save the state
weary marches and sinking ships
cheers of victory on dying lips
days of plenty and years of peace
march of a strong land's swift increase
equal justice, right and law
stately honor and reverent awe
sign of a nation, great and strong
to ward her people from foreign wrong
pride and glory and honor, all
live in the colors to stand or fall
hats off
along the street there comes
a blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums
and loyal hearts are beating high
hats off
the flag is passing by
the rivers of france are ten score and twain
but five are the names that we know
the marne, the vesle, the oureq and the aisne
and the somme of the swampy flow
the rivers of france, from source to sea
are nourished by many a rill
but these five, if ever a drouth there be
the fountains of sorrow would fill
the rivers of france shine silver white
but the waters of five are red
with the richest blood, in the fiercest fight
for freedom that ever was shed
the rivers of france sing soft as they run
but five have a song of their own
that hymns the fall of the arrogant one
and the proud cast down from his throne
the rivers of france all quietly take
to sleep in the house of their birth
but the carnadined wave of five shall break
on the uttermost strands of earth
five rivers of france--see! their names are writ
on a banner of crimson and gold
and the glory of those who fashioned it
shall nevermore cease to be told
there's no dew left on the daisies and clover
there's no rain left in heaven
i've said my "seven times" over and over
seven times one are seven
i am old, so old i can write a letter
my birthday lessons are done
the lambs play always, they know no better
they are only one times one
o moon! in the night i have seen you sailing
and shining so round and low
you were bright! but your light is failing
you are nothing now but a bow
you moon, have you done something wrong in heaven
that god has hidden your face
i hope if you have, you'll soon be forgiven
and shine again in your place
o velvet bee, you're a dusty fellow
you've powdered your legs with gold
o brave marshmary buds, rich and yellow
give me your money to hold
o columbine, open your folded wrapper
where two twin turtle-doves dwell
o cuckoo-pint, toll me the purple clapper
that hangs in your clear green bell
and show me your nest, with the young ones in it
i will not steal them away
i am old! you may trust me, linnet, linnet
i am seven times one to-day
you bells in the steeple, ring, ring out your changes
how many soever they be
and let the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges
come over, come over to me
yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling
no magical sense conveys
and bells have forgotten their old art of telling
the fortune of future days
while a boy listened alone
made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily
all by himself on a stone
poor bells! i forgive you; your good days are over
and mine, they are yet to be
no listening, no longing shall aught, aught discover
you leave the story to me
the foxglove shoots out of the green matted heather
preparing her hoods of snow
she was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather
oh, children take long to grow
i wish and i wish that the spring would go faster
nor long summer bide so late
and i could grow on like the foxglove and aster
for some things are ill to wait
i wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover
while dear hands are laid on my head
for all the lessons are said
i wait for my story--the birds cannot sing it
not one, as he sits on the tree
the bells cannot ring it, but long years, oh bring it
such as i wish it to be
i leaned out of window, i smelt the white clover
dark, dark was the garden, i saw not the gate
hush, nightingale, hush! o sweet nightingale, wait
till i listen and hear
if a step draweth near
for my love he is late
a cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree
the fall of the water comes sweeter, comes clearer
to what art thou listening, and what dost thou see
let the star-clusters grow
let the sweet waters flow
and cross quickly to me
from sycamore blossoms, or settle or sleep
you glowworms, shine out, and the pathway discover
to him that comes darkling along the rough steep
ah, my sailor, make haste
for the time runs to waste
and my love lieth deep
i've conned thee an answer, it waits thee to-night
by the sycamore passed he, and through the white clover
then all the sweet speech i had fashioned took flight
but i'll love him more, more
than e'er wife loved before
be the days dark or bright
heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall
when the wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses
and dance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small
here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own lasses
eager to gather them all
heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
mother shall thread them a daisy chain
sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow
that loved her brown little ones, loved them full fain
sing, "heart, thou art wide though the house be but narrow
sing once, and sing it again
heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow
a ship sails afar over warm ocean waters
and haply one musing doth stand at her prow
o bonny brown son, and o sweet little daughters
maybe he thinks on you now
heigh-ho! daisies and buttercups
fair yellow daffodils, stately and tall
a sunshiny world full of laughter and leisure
and fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall
send down on their pleasure smiles passing its measure
god that is over us all
ere, in the northern gale
the summer tresses of the trees are gone
the woods of autumn, all around our vale
have put their glory on
the mountains that infold
in their wide sweep, the colored landscape round
seem groups of giant kings, in purple and gold
that guard the enchanted ground
i roam the woods that crown
the upland, where the mingled splendors glow
where the gay company of trees look down
on the green fields below
my steps are not alone
in these bright walks; the sweet southwest, at play
flies, rustling, where the painted leaves are strown
along the winding way
and far in heaven, the while
the sun, that sends that gale to wander here
pours out on the fair earth his quiet smile
the sweetest of the year
where now the solemn shade
verdure and gloom where many branches meet
so grateful, when the noon of summer made
the valleys sick with heat
let in through all the trees
come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright
their sunny-colored foliage, in the breeze
twinkles, like beams of light
the rivulet, late unseen
where bickering through the shrubs its waters run
shines with the image of its golden screen
and glimmerings of the sun
but 'neath yon crimson tree
lover to listening maid might breathe his flame
nor mark, within its roseate canopy
her blush of maiden shame
oh, autumn! why so soon
depart the hues that make thy forests glad
thy gentle wind and thy fair sunny noon
and leave thee wild and sad
ah! 'twere a lot too blessed
forever in thy colored shades to stray
amid the kisses of the soft southwest
to rove and dream for aye
and leave the vain low strife
that makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power
the passions and the cares that wither life
and waste its little hour
did you ever hear of the drummer boy of mission ridge, who lay
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of
that terrible day
they were firing above him and firing below, and the tempest of shot
and shell
was raging like death, as he moaned in his pain, by the breastworks
where he fell
moment when
he might follow the ranks and shoulder a gun with the best of us
bearded men
and so when the signals from old fort wood set an army of veterans wild
he flung down his drum, which spun down the hill like the ball of a
wayward child
as we charged by the flank, with our colors ahead, and our columns
in the long, swinging lines of that splendid advance, when the flags
of our corps floated out
like the ribbons that dance in the jubilant lines of the march of a
gala day rout
he charged with the ranks, though he carried no gun, for the colonel
had said him nay
and he breasted the blast of the bristling guns, and the shock of the
sickening fray
and when by his side they were falling like hail he sprang to a comrade
slain
and shouldered his musket and bore it as true as the hand that was dead
in pain
black eye
that flashed forth a spirit too great for his form--he only was just so
as tall, perhaps, as your little lad who scarcely reaches your shoulder
though his heart was the heart of a veteran then, a trifle, it may be
bolder
he pressed to the front, our lad so leal, and the works were almost won
a moment more and our flags had swung o'er the muzzle of murderous gun
but a raking fire swept the van, and he fell 'mid the wounded and slain
with his wee wan face turned up to him who feeleth his children's pain
again and again our lines fell back, and again with shivering shocks
they flung themselves on the rebels' works as ships are tossed on rocks
to be crushed and broken and scattered amain, as the wrecks of the
surging storm
where none may rue and none may reck of aught that has human form
so under the ridge we were lying for the order to charge again
and we counted our comrades missing, and we counted our comrades slain
and one said, "johnny, our drummer boy, is grievously shot and lies
just under the enemy's breastwork; if left on the field he dies
then all the blood that was in me  surged up to my aching brow
and my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat--i can feel it even now
and i said i would bring that boy from the field, if god would spare my
breath
if all the guns in mission ridge should thunder the threat of death
i crept and crept up the ghastly ridge, by the wounded and the dead
with the moans of my comrades right and left, behind me and yet ahead
till i came to the form of our drummer boy, in his blouse of dusty blue
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, where the blast of
the battle blew
and his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of
stone
as he tried like a wounded bird to rise, and placed his hand in my own
and he said in a voice half smothered, though its whispering thrills
me yet
the men go up those breastworks there, just stop and waken me
for though i cannot make the charge  and join the cheers that rise
i may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies
well, it was hard to treat him so, his poor limb shattered sore
but i raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore
and the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy
and uttered fervent prayers for him, our valiant drummer boy
when sped the news that "fighting joe" had saved the union right
with his legions fresh from lookout; and that thomas massed his might
and forced the rebel center; and our cheering ran like wild
and sherman's heart was happy as the heart of a little child
when grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly
along the slopes of mission ridge, where'er he cast his eye
and when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done
the fearful contest ended, and the glorious victory won
then his bright black eyes so yearning grew strangely rapt and wide
and in that hour of conquest our little hero died
but ever in our hearts he dwells, with a grace that ne'er is old
for him the heart to duty wed can nevermore grow cold
and when they tell of heroes, and the laurels they have won
of the scars they are doomed to carry, of the deeds that they have done
of the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead
the gory sod beneath them, the bursting shell o'erhead
my heart goes back to mission ridge and the drummer boy who lay
with his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of
that terrible day
and i say that the land that bears such sons is crowned and dowered
with all
the dear god giveth nations to stay them lest they fall
oh, glory of mission ridge, stream on, like the roseate light of morn
on the sons that now are living, on the sons that are yet unborn
and cheers for our comrades living, and tears as they pass away
and three times three for the drummer boy who fought at the front that
if you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
but make allowance for their doubting too
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
or being lied about don't deal in lies
or being hated don't give way to hating
and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise
if you can dream and not make dreams your master
if you can think and not make thoughts your aim
if you can meet with triumph and disaster
and treat those two impostors just the same
if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
and stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools
if you can make one heap of all your winnings
and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss
and lose, and start again at your beginnings
and never breathe a word about your loss
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
to serve your turn long after they are gone
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
except the will which says to them: "hold on
if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
or walk with kings nor lose the common touch
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you
if all men count with you, but none too much
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
with sixty seconds' worth of distance run
yours is the earth and everything that's in it
and--which is more--you'll be a man, my son
some boys are mad when comp'ny comes to stay for meals. they hate
to have the other people eat while boys must wait and wait
but i've about made up my mind i'm different from the rest
for as for me, i b'lieve i like the second table best
to eat along with comp'ny is so trying, for it's tough
to sit and watch the victuals when you dassent touch the stuff
you see your father serving out the dark meat and the light
until a boy is sure he'll starve before he gets a bite
and when, he asks you what you'll have,--you've heard it all before
you know you'll get just what you get and won't get nothing more
for, when you want another piece, your mother winks her eye
and so you say, "i've plenty, thanks!" and tell a whopping lie
when comp'ny is a-watching you, you've got to be polite
and eat your victuals with a fork and take a little bite
you can't have nothing till you're asked and, 'cause a boy is small
folks think he isn't hungry, and he's never asked at all
since i can first remember i've been told that when the cake
is passed around, the proper thing is for a boy to take
the piece that's nearest to him, and so all i ever got
when comp'ny's been to our house, was the smallest in the lot
it worries boys like everything to have the comp'ny stay
a-setting round the table, like they couldn't get away
but when they've gone, and left the whole big shooting match to me
say! ain't it fun to just wade in and help myself? oh, gee
with no one round to notice what you're doing--bet your life
boys don't use forks to eat with when they'd rather use a knife
nor take such little bites as when they're eating with the rest
and so, for lots of things, i like the second table best
when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and the school for the day is dismissed
and the little ones gather around me
to bid me good night and be kissed
oh, the little white arms that encircle
my neck in their tender embrace
oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven
shedding sunshine of love on my face
and when they are gone, i sit dreaming
of my childhood, too lovely to last
of love that my heart will remember
when it wakes to the pulse of the past
ere the world and its wickedness made me
a partner of sorrow and sin
when the glory of god was about me
and the glory of gladness within
all my heart grows weak as a woman's
and the fountains of feeling will flow
when i think of the paths steep and stony
where the feet of the dear ones must go
of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them
of the tempest of fate blowing wild
oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy
as the innocent heart of a child
they are idols of hearts and of households
they are angels of god in disguise
his sunlight still sleeps in their tresses
his glory still gleams in their eyes
oh, these truants from home and from heaven
they have made me more manly and mild
and i know now how jesus could liken
the kingdom of god to a child
i ask not a life for the dear ones
all radiant, as others have done
but that life may have just enough shadow
to temper the glare of the sun
i would pray god to guard them from evil
but my prayer would bound back to myself
ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner
but a sinner must pray for himself
the twig is so easily bended
i have banished the rule and the rod
i have taught them the goodness of knowledge
they have taught me the goodness of god
my heart is the dungeon of darkness
where i shut them for breaking a rule
my frown is sufficient correction
my love is the law of the school
i shall leave the old house in the autumn
to traverse its threshold no more
ah! how shall i sigh for the dear ones
that meet me each morn at the door
i shall miss the "good nights" and the kisses
and the gush of their innocent glee
the group on its green, and the flowers
that are brought every morning to me
i shall miss them at morn and at even
their song in the school and the street
i shall miss the low hum of their voices
and the tread of their delicate feet
when the lessons of life are all ended
and death says, "the school is dismissed
may the little ones gather around me
to bid me good night and be kissed
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there
the children were nestled all snug in their beds
while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads
and mamma in her kerchief, and i in my cap
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
away to the window i flew like a flash
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
the moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow
gave a luster of midday to objects below
when what to my wondering eyes should appear
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
with a little old driver, so lively and quick
i knew in a moment it must be st. nick
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came
and he whistled and shouted, and called them by name
on, comet, on, cupid! on, donder and blitzen
to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
now, dash away, dash sway, dash away all
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
so, up to the house-top the coursers they flew
with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas too
and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof
as i drew in my head, and was turning around
down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound
he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack
his eyes how they twinkled; his dimples how merry
his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth
and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
he had a broad face and a little round belly
that shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly
he was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf
and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself
a wink of his eye, and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread
he spake not a word, but went straight to his work
and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk
and laying his finger aside of his nose
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose
he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle
but i heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight
if you cannot on the ocean
sail among the swiftest fleet
rocking on the highest billows
laughing at the storms you meet
you can stand among the sailors
anchored yet within the bay
you can lend a hand to help them
as they launch their boats away
if you are too weak to journey
up the mountain steep and high
you can stand within the valley
while the multitudes go by
you can chant in happy measure
as they slowly pass along
though they may forget the singer
they will not forget the song
if you have not gold and silver
ever ready to command
if you cannot towards the needy
reach an ever-open hand
you can visit the afflicted
o'er the erring you can weep
you can be a true disciple
sitting at the savior's feet
if you cannot in the conflict
prove yourself a soldier true
if where fire and smoke are thickest
there's no work for you to do
when the battle-field is silent
you can go with careful tread
you can bear away the wounded
you can cover up the dead
do not then stand idly waiting
for some greater work to do
fortune is a lazy goddess
she will never come to you
go and toil in any vineyard
do not fear to do or dare
if you want a field of labor
you can find it anywhere
there are hermit souls that live withdrawn
in the peace of their self-content
there are souls, like stars, that dwell apart
in a fellowless firmament
there are pioneer souls that blaze their paths
where highways never ran
but let me live by the side of the road
and be a friend to man
let me live in a house by the side of the road
where the race of men go by
the men who are good and the men who are bad
i would not sit in the scorner's seat
or hurl the cynic's ban
let me live in a house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man
i see from my house by the side of the road
by the side of the highway of life
the men who press with the ardor of hope
the men who are faint with the strife
but i turn not away from their smiles nor their tears
both parts of an infinite plan
let me live in my house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man
i know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead
and mountains of wearisome height
that the road passes on through the long afternoon
and stretches away to the night
but still i rejoice when the travelers rejoice
and weep with the strangers that moan
nor live in my house by the side of the road
like a man who dwells alone
let me live in my house by the side of the road
where the race of men go by
they are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong
then why should i sit in the scorner's seat
or hurl the cynic's ban
let me live in my house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man
the first thing that i remember was carlo tugging away
with the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling, as much as to
think of the souls in the coming train, and the graves you are sending
them to
think of the mother and the babe at her breast, think of the father and
think of the lover and the loved one too, think of them doomed every one
to fall (as it were by your very hand) into yon fathomless ditch
murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now lies asleep at
the switch
i sprang up amazed--scarce knew where i stood, sleep had o'ermastered
me so
i could hear the wind hollowly howling, and the deep river dashing below
i could hear the forest leaves rustling, as the trees by the tempest were
fanned
but what was that noise in the distance? that, i could not understand
i heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled drum
then nearer and nearer it came to me, till it made my very ears hum
what is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to my brain
what whistle's that, yelling so shrill? ah! i know now; it's the train
we often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to the place
so i stood--with this demon before me, its heated breath scorching my
its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the eyes of
some witch
the train was almost upon me before i remembered the switch
i sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the track
the switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it back
on, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and shot by my face like a flash
i swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing after the crash
how long i lay there unconscious 'twas impossible for me to tell
my stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a hell
for then i heard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands and wives
and i thought of the day we all shrink from, when i must account for
their lives
mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes glaring madly and wild
fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a child
children searching for parents, i noticed, as by me they sped
and lips, that could form naught but "mamma," were calling for one
perhaps dead
my mind was made up in a moment, the river should hide me away
when, under the still burning rafters i suddenly noticed there lay
a little white hand; she who owned it was doubtless an object of love
to one whom her loss would drive frantic, though she guarded him now
from above
i tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side
how little she thought of her journey when she left for this dark, fatal
i lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some spark
of life
turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized--maggie, my
o lord! my scourge is a hard one, at a blow thou hast shattered my pride
my life will be one endless nightmare, with maggie away from my side
how often i'd sat down and pictured the scenes in our long, happy life
how i'd strive through all my lifetime, to build up a home for my wife
how people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little nest
how i should do all the labor, and maggie should all the day rest
how one of god's blessings might cheer us, how some day i perhaps should
be rich
but all of my dreams had been shattered, while i lay there asleep at the
switch
i fancied i stood on my trial, the jury and judge i could see
and every eye in the court room was steadily fixed upon me
and fingers were pointed in scorn, till i felt my face blushing blood-red
and the next thing i heard were the words, "hanged by the neck until
then i felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught tight hold of a
dress
guess
and there stood maggie, my wife, with never a scar from the ditch
i'd been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been "asleep at the switch
a fire-mist and a planet
a crystal and a cell
a jellyfish and a saurian
and caves where the cavemen dwell
then a sense of law and beauty
and a face turned from the clod
some call it evolution
and others call it god
a haze in the far horizon
the infinite, tender sky
the ripe, rich tints of the cornfields
and the wild geese sailing high
and all over upland and lowland
the charm of the goldenrod
some of us call it nature
and others call it god
like tides on a crescent sea-beach
when the moon is new and thin
into our hearts high yearnings
come welling and surging in
come from the mystic ocean
whose rim no foot has trod
some of us call it longing
and others call it god
a picket frozen on duty
a mother starved for her brood
socrates drinking the hemlock
and jesus on the rood
the millions who, humble and nameless
the straight, hard pathway trod
some call it consecration
and others call it god
come, listen all unto my song
it is no silly fable
they call the atlantic cable
bold cyrus field he said, says he
i have a pretty notion
that i can run the telegraph
across the atlantic ocean
then all the people laughed, and said
they'd like to see him do it
he might get half-seas over, but
he never could go through it
to carry out his foolish plan
he never would be able
he might as well go hang himself
with his atlantic cable
but cyrus was a valiant man
a fellow of decision
and heeded not their mocking words
their laughter and derision
twice did his bravest efforts fail
and yet his mind was stable
he wa'n't the man to break his heart
because he broke his cable
once more they tried--hurrah! hurrah
what means this great commotion
the lord be praised! the cable's laid
across the atlantic ocean
loud ring the bells,--for, flashing through
six hundred leagues of water
old mother england's benison
salutes her eldest daughter
o'er all the land the tidings speed
and soon, in every nation
they'll hear about the cable with
profoundest admiration
the manly, bold, and stable
and tell our sons, to make them brave
how cyrus laid the cable
jane jones keeps talkin' to me all the time
an' says you must make it a rule
to study your lessons 'nd work hard 'nd learn
an' never be absent from school
remember the story of elihu burritt
an' how he clum up to the top
got all the knowledge 'at he ever had
down in a blacksmithing shop
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course what's a-keepin' me 'way from the top
is not never havin' no blacksmithing shop
she said 'at ben franklin was awfully poor
but full of ambition an' brains
an' studied philosophy all his hull life
an' see what he got for his pains
he brought electricity out of the sky
with a kite an' a bottle an' key
an' we're owing him more'n any one else
for all the bright lights 'at we see
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course what's allers been hinderin' me
is not havin' any kite, lightning er key
jane jones said abe lincoln had no books at all
an' used to split rails when a boy
an' general grant was a tanner by trade
an' lived 'way out in illinois
so when the great war in the south first broke out
he stood on the side o' the right
an' when lincoln called him to take charge o' things
he won nearly every blamed fight
jane jones she honestly said it was so
mebbe he did
i dunno
still i ain't to blame, not by a big sight
for i ain't never had any battles to fight
she said 'at columbus was out at the knees
when he first thought up his big scheme
an' told all the spaniards 'nd italians, too
an' all of 'em said 'twas a dream
but queen isabella jest listened to him
mebbe he did
i dunno
o' course that may be, but then you must allow
they ain't no land to discover jest now
mounted on kyrat strong and fleet
his chestnut steed with four white feet
roushan beg, called kurroglou
son of the road and bandit chief
seeking refuge and relief
up the mountain pathway flew
such was kyrat's wondrous speed
never yet could any steed
reach the dust-cloud in his course
more than maiden, more than wife
more than gold and next to life
roushan the robber loved his horse
in the land that lies beyond
erzeroum and trebizond
garden-girt his fortress stood
plundered khan, or caravan
journeying north from koordistan
gave him wealth and wine and food
seven hundred and fourscore
men at arms his livery wore
did his bidding night and day
now, through regions all unknown
he was wandering, lost, alone
seeking without guide his way
suddenly the pathway ends
sheer the precipice descends
loud the torrent roars unseen
thirty feet from side to side
yawns the chasm; on air must ride
he who crosses this ravine
following close in his pursuit
at the precipice's foot
reyhan the arab of orfah
halted with his hundred men
shouting upward from the glen
gently roushan beg caressed
kyrat's forehead, neck, and breast
kissed him upon both his eyes
sang to him in his wild way
as upon the topmost spray
sings a bird before it flies
round and slender as a reed
carry me this peril through
satin housings shall be thine
shoes of gold, o kyrat mine
o thou soul of kurroglou
soft as woman's hair thy mane
tender are thine eyes and true
all thy hoofs like ivory shine
polished bright; o life of mine
leap, and rescue kurroglou
kyrat, then, the strong and fleet
drew together his four white feet
paused a moment on the verge
measured with his eye the space
and into the air's embrace
leaped, as leaps the ocean surge
as the ocean surge o'er sand
bears a swimmer safe to land
kyrat safe his rider bore
rattling down the deep abyss
fragments of the precipice
rolled like pebbles on a shore
roushan's tasseled cap of red
trembled not upon his head
careless sat he and upright
neither hand nor bridle shook
nor his head he turned to look
as he galloped out of sight
flash of harness in the air
seen a moment like the glare
of a sword drawn from its sheath
thus the phantom horseman passed
and the shadow that he cast
leaped the cataract underneath
reyhan the arab held his breath
while this vision of life and death
passed above him. "allahu
cried he. "in all koordistan
lives there not so brave a man
as this robber kurroglou
ay, tear her tattered ensign down
long has it waved on high
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky
beneath it rung the battle shout
and burst the cannon's roar
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more
her deck, once red with heroes' blood
where knelt the vanquished foe
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood
and waves were white below
no more shall feel the victor's tread
or know the conquered knee
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea
oh, better that her shattered hulk
should sink beneath the wave
her thunders shook the mighty deep
and there should be her grave
nail to the mast her holy flag
set every threadbare sail
and give her to the god of storms
the lightning and the gale
tell me not, in mournful numbers
for the soul is dead that slumbers
and things are not what they seem
life is real! life is earnest
and the grave is not its goal
was not spoken of the soul
not enjoyment, and not sorrow
is our destined end or way
but to act that each to-morrow
finds us farther than to-day
art is long, and time is fleeting
and our hearts, though stout and brave
still, like muffled drums, are beating
funeral marches to the grave
in the world's broad field of battle
in the bivouac of life
be not like dumb, driven cattle
be a hero in the strife
trust no future, howe'er pleasant
let the dead past bury its dead
act, act in the living present
heart within, and god o'erhead
lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime
and, departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time
footprints, that perhaps another
sailing o'er life's solemn main
a forlorn and shipwrecked brother
seeing, shall take heart again
let us, then, be up and doing
with a heart for any fate
still achieving, still pursuing
learn to labor and to wait
i think, of all the things at school
a boy has got to do

singing through the forests, rattling over ridges
shooting under arches, rumbling over bridges
whizzing through the mountains, buzzing o'er the vale
bless me! this is pleasant, riding on the rail
men of different stations in the eye of fame
here are very quickly coming to the same
high and lowly people, birds of every feather
on a common level, traveling together
gentlemen in shorts, blooming very tall
gentlemen at large, talking very small
gentlemen in tights, with a loosish mien
gentlemen in gray, looking very green
gentlemen quite old, asking for the news
gentlemen in black, with a fit of blues
gentlemen in claret, sober as a vicar
gentlemen in tweed, dreadfully in liquor
stranger on the right looking very sunny
obviously reading something very funny
now the smiles are thicker--wonder what they mean
faith, he's got the knickerbocker magazine
stranger on the left, closing up his peepers
now he snores again, like the seven sleepers
at his feet a volume gives the explanation
how the man grew stupid from "association
ancient maiden lady anxiously remarks
that there must be peril 'mong so many sparks
roguish-looking fellow, turning to the stranger
says 'tis his opinion _she_ is out of danger
woman with her baby, sitting _vis a vis
baby keeps a-squalling, woman looks at me
asks about the distance--says 'tis tiresome talking
noises of the cars are so very shocking
market woman, careful of the precious casket
knowing eggs are eggs, tightly holds her basket
feeling that a smash, if it came, would surely
send her eggs to pot rather prematurely
singing through the forests, rattling over ridges
shooting under arches, rumbling over bridges
whizzing through the mountains, buzzing o'er the vale
bless me! this is pleasant, riding on the rail
thou, too, sail on, o ship of state
sail on, o union, strong and great
humanity with all its fears
with all the hopes of future years
is hanging breathless on thy fate
we know what master laid thy keel
what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel
who made each mast, and sail, and rope
what anvils rang, what hammers beat
in what a forge and what a heat
were shaped the anchors of thy hope
fear not each sudden sound and shock
and not a rent made by the gale
in spite of rock and tempest's roar
in spite of false lights on the shore
sail on, nor fear to breast the sea
our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee
our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears
our faith truiumphant o'er our fears
are all with thee,--are all with thee

the barber was busy, and he couldn't stop
the customers, waiting their turns, were all reading
the _daily_, the _herald_, the _post_, little heeding
the young man who blurted out such a blunt question
not one raised a head, or even made a suggestion
and the barber kept on shaving
cried the youth, with a frown
how preposterous each wing is
how flattened the head is, how jammed down the neck is
in short, the whole owl, what an ignorant wreck 'tis
i make no apology; i've learned owleology
i've passed days and nights in a hundred collections
and cannot be blinded to any deflections
arising from unskilful fingers that fail
to stuff a bird right, from his beak to his tail
mister brown! mister brown! do take that bird down
or you'll soon be the laughing-stock all over town
and the barber kept on shaving
and other night fowls
and i tell you
what i know to be true
an owl cannot roost
with his limbs so unloosed
no owl in this world
ever had his claws curled
ever had his legs slanted
ever had his bill canted
ever had his neck screwed
into that attitude
he can't _do_ it, because
anatomy teaches
ornithology preaches
an owl has a toe
that _can't_ turn out so
i've made the white owl my study for years
and to see such a job almost moves me to tears
mister brown, i'm amazed
you should be so gone crazed
as to put up a bird
in that posture absurd
to _look_ at that owl really brings on a dizziness
the man who stuffed him don't half know his business
and the barber kept on shaving
i'm filled with surprise
taxidermists should pass
off on you such poor glass
so unnatural they seem
they'd make audubon scream
and john burroughs laugh
to encounter such chaff
do take that bird down
have him stuffed again, brown
and the barber kept on shaving
i could stuff in the dark
an owl better than that
i could make an old hat
look more like an owl
than that horrid fowl
stuck up here so stiff like a side of coarse leather
in fact, about _him _there's not one natural feather
just then, with a wink and a sly normal lurch
the owl, very gravely, got down from his perch
walked round, and regarded his fault-finding critic
and then fairly hooted, as if he should say
don't waste it again on a live bird, i pray
i'm an owl; you're another. sir critic, good-day
and the barber kept on shaving
the end has come, as come it must
to all things; in these sweet june days
the teacher and the scholar trust
their parting feet to separate ways
they part: but in the years to be
shall pleasant memories cling to each
as shells bear inland from the sea
the murmur of the rhythmic beach
one knew the joys the sculptor knows
when, plastic to his lightest touch
his clay-wrought model slowly grows
to that fine grace desired so much
so daily grew before her eyes
the living shapes whereon she wrought
strong, tender, innocently wise
the child's heart with the woman's thought
and one shall never quite forget
the voice that called from dream and play
the firm but kindly hand that set
her feet in learning's pleasant way
the joy of undine soul-possessed
the wakening sense, the strange delight
that swelled the fabled statue's breast
and filled its clouded eyes with sight
o youth and beauty, loved of all
ye pass from girlhood's gate of dreams
in broader ways your footsteps fall
ye test the truth of all that seems
her little realm the teacher leaves
she breaks her wand of power apart
while, for your love and trust, she gives
the warm thanks of a grateful heart
hers is the sober summer noon
contrasted with your morn of spring
the waning with the waxing moon
the folded with the outspread wing
across the distance of the years
she sends her god-speed back to you
she has no thought of doubts or fears
be but yourselves, be pure, be true
and prompt in duty; heed the deep
low voice of conscience; through the ill
and discord round about you, keep
your faith in human nature still
be gentle: unto griefs and needs
be pitiful as woman should
and, spite of all the lies of creeds
hold fast the truth that god is good
give and receive; go forth and bless
the world that needs the hand and heart
of martha's helpful carefulness
no less than mary's better part
so shall the stream of time flow by
and leave each year a richer good
and matron loveliness outvie
the nameless charm of maidenhood
and, when the world shall link your names
with gracious lives and manners fine
the teacher shall assert her claims
and proudly whisper, "these were mine
oh, that i might have my request, and that god would grant me the thing
that i long for.--_job 6:8
it was peeping through the brambles, that little wild white rose
where the hawthorn hedge was planted, my garden to enclose
all beyond was fern and heather, on the breezy, open moor
all within was sun and shelter, and the wealth of beauty's store
but i did not heed the fragrance of flow'ret or of tree
for my eyes were on that rosebud, and it grew too high for me
in vain i strove to reach it through the tangled mass of green
it only smiled and nodded behind its thorny screen
yet through that summer morning i lingered near the spot
oh, why do things seem sweeter if we possess them not
my garden buds were blooming, but all that i could see
was that little mocking wild rose, hanging just too high for me
so in life's wider garden there are buds of promise, too
beyond our reach to gather, but not beyond our view
and like the little charmer that tempted me astray
they steal out half the brightness of many a summer's day
oh, hearts that fail with longing for some forbidden tree
look up and learn a lesson from my white rose and me
than ever to be sighing for just one bud more sweet
my sunbeams and my shadows fall from a pierced hand
i can surely trust his wisdom since his heart i understand
and maybe in the morning, when his blessed face i see
he will tell me why my white rose grew just too high for me
when earth's last picture is painted, and the tubes are twisted and dried
when the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died
we shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two
till the master of all good workmen shall set us to work anew
and those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair
they shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair
they shall find real saints to draw from--magdalene, peter and paul
they shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all
and only the master shall praise us, and only the master shall blame
and no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame
but each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star
shall draw the thing as he sees it for the god of things as they are
you're surprised that i ever should say so
just wait till the reason i've given
why i say i sha'n't care for the music
unless there is whistling in heaven
then you'll think it no very great wonder
nor so strange, nor so bold a conceit
that unless there's a boy there a-whistling
its music will not be complete
it was late in the autumn of '40
we had come from our far eastern home
just in season to build us a cabin
ere the cold of the winter should come
and we lived all the while in our wagon
that husband was clearing the place
where the house was to stand; and the clearing
and building it took many days
so that our heads were scarce sheltered
in under its roof when our store
of provisions was almost exhausted
and husband must journey for more
and the nearest place where he could get them
was yet such a distance away
that it forced him from home to be absent
at least a whole night and a day
you see, we'd but two or three neighbors
and the nearest was more than a mile
and we hadn't found time yet to know them
for we had been busy the while
and the man who had helped at the raising
just staid till the job was well done
and as soon as his money was paid him
had shouldered his axe and had gone
well, husband just kissed me and started
i could scarcely suppress a deep groan
at the thought of remaining with baby
so long in the house alone
for, my dear, i was childish and timid
and braver ones might well have feared
for the wild wolf was often heard howling
and savages sometimes appeared
but i smothered my grief and my terror
till husband was off on his ride
and then in my arms i took josey
and all the day long sat and cried
as i thought of the long, dreary hours
when the darkness of night should fall
and i was so utterly helpless
with no one in reach of my call
and when the night came with its terrors
to hide ev'ry ray of light
i hung up a quilt by the window
and, almost dead with affright
i kneeled by the side of the cradle
scarce daring to draw a full breath
lest the baby should wake, and its crying
should bring us a horrible death
there i knelt until late in the evening
and scarcely an inch had i stirred
when suddenly, far in the distance
a sound as of whistling i heard
i started up dreadfully frightened
for fear 'twas an indian's call
and then very soon i remembered
the red man ne'er whistles at all
and when i was sure 'twas a white man
i thought, were he coming for ill
he'd surely approach with more caution
would come without warning, and still
then the sound, coming nearer and nearer
took the form of a tune light and gay
and i knew i needn't fear evil
from one who could whistle that way
very soon i heard footsteps approaching
then came a peculiar dull thump
as if some one was heavily striking
an ax in the top of a stump
and then, in another brief moment
there came a light tap on the door
when quickly i undid the fast'ning
and in stepped a boy, and before
there was either a question or answer
or either had time to speak
i just threw my glad arms around him
and gave him a kiss on the cheek
then i started back, scared at my boldness
but he only smiled at my fright
as he said, "i'm your neighbor's boy, ellick
come to tarry with you through the night
and made up our minds where he'd gone
and i said to the rest of our people
and i venture she's awfully lonesome
and though she may have no great fear
i think she would feel a bit safer
if only a boy were but near
for fear that a savage might stray
across my path and need scalping
i started right down this way
and coming in sight of the cabin
and thinking to save you alarm
i whistled a tune, just to show you
i didn't intend any harm
but if you don't want me to stay
why, all you need do is to say so
and should'ring my axe, i'll away
i dropped in a chair and near fainted
just at thought of his leaving me then
and his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle
as he said, "i guess i'll remain
and then i just sat there and told him
how terribly frightened i'd been
how his face was to me the most welcome
of any i ever had seen
and then i lay down with the baby
and slept all the blessed night through
for i felt i was safe from all danger
near so brave a young fellow, and true
so now, my dear friend, do you wonder
since such a good reason i've given
why i say i sha'n't care for the music
unless there is whistling in heaven
yes, often i've said so in earnest
and now what i've said i repeat
that unless there's a boy there a-whistling
its music will not be complete
sleep, baby, sleep
thy father's watching the sheep
thy mother's shaking the dreamland tree
and down drops a little dream for thee
sleep, baby, sleep
sleep, baby, sleep
the large stars are the sheep
the little stars are the lambs, i guess
the bright moon is the shepherdess
sleep, baby, sleep
sleep, baby, sleep
thy savior loves his sheep
he is the lamb of god on high
who for our sakes came down to die
sleep, baby, sleep
seated one day at the organ
i was weary and ill at ease
and my fingers wandered idly
over the noisy keys
i do not know what i was playing
or what i was dreaming then
but i struck one chord of music
like the sound of a great amen
it flooded the crimson twilight
like the close of an angel's psalm
and it lay on my fevered spirit
with a touch of infinite calm
it quieted pain and sorrow
like love overcoming strife
it seemed the harmonious echo
from our discordant life
it linked all perplexing meanings
into one perfect peace
and trembled away into silence
as if it were loth to cease
i have sought, but i seek it vainly
that one lost chord divine
that came from the soul of the organ
and entered into mine
it may be that death's bright angel
will speak in that chord again
it may be that only in heaven
i shall hear that grand amen
between the dark and the daylight
when the night is beginning to lower
comes a pause in the day's occupations
that is known as the children's hour
i hear in the chamber above me
the patter of little feet
the sound of a door that is opened
and voices soft and sweet
from my study i see in the lamplight
descending the broad hall stair
grave alice, and laughing allegra
and edith with golden hair
a whisper, and then a silence
yet i know by their merry eyes
they are plotting and planning together
to take me by surprise
a sudden rush from the stairway
a sudden raid from the hall
by three doors left unguarded
they enter my castle wall
they climb up into my turret
o'er the arms and back of my chair
if i try to escape, they surround me
they seem to be everywhere
they almost devour me with kisses
their arms about me entwine
till i think of the bishop of bingen
in his mouse-tower on the rhine
do you think, o blue-eyed banditti
because you have scaled the wall
such an old mustache as i am
is not a match for you all
i have you fast in my fortress
and will not let you depart
but put you down into the dungeon
in the round-tower of my heart
and there will i keep you forever
yes, forever and a day
till the walls shall crumble to ruin
and moulder in dust away
woodman, spare that tree
touch not a single bough
in youth it sheltered me
and i'll protect it now
that placed it near his cot
there, woodman, let it stand
thy ax shall harm it not
that old familiar tree
whose glory and renown
are spread o'er land and sea
and wouldst thou hew it down
woodman, forbear thy stroke
cut not its earth-bound ties
oh, spare that aged oak
now towering to the skies
when but an idle boy
i sought its grateful shade
in all their gushing joy
here, too, my sisters played
my mother kissed me here
my father pressed my hand
forgive this foolish tear
but let that old oak stand
my heart-strings round thee cling
close as thy bark, old friend
here shall the wild-bird sing
and still thy branches bend
old tree! the storm still brave
and, woodman, leave the spot
while i've a hand to save
thy ax shall harm it not
they drive home the cows from the pasture
up through the long shady lane
where the quail whistles loud in the wheat-fields
that are yellow with ripening grain
they find, in the thick waving grasses
where the scarlet-lipped strawberry grows
they gather the earliest snowdrops
and the first crimson buds of the rose
they toss the new hay in the meadow
they gather the elder-bloom white
they find where the dusky grapes purple
in the soft-tinted october light
they know where the apples hang ripest
and are sweeter than italy's wines
they know where the fruit hangs the thickest
on the long, thorny blackberry vines
they gather the delicate sea-weeds
and build tiny castles of sand
they pick up the beautiful sea shells
fairy barks that have drifted to land
they wave from the tall, rocking tree-tops
where the oriole's hammock-nest swings
and at night time are folded in slumber
by a song that a fond mother sings
those who toil bravely are strongest
the humble and poor become great
and so from these brown-handed children
shall grow mighty rulers of state
the pen of the author and statesman
the noble and wise of the land
the sword, and the chisel, and palette
shall be held in the little brown hand
up from the meadows rich with corn
clear in the cool september morn
the clustered spires of frederick stand
green-walled by the hills of maryland
round about them orchards sweep
apple and peach tree fruited deep
fair as the garden of the lord
to the eyes of the famished rebel horde
on that pleasant morn of the early fall
when lee marched over the mountain-wall
over the mountains winding down
horse and foot, into frederick town
forty flags with their silver stars
forty flags with their crimson bars
flapped in the morning wind; the sun
of noon looked down, and saw not one
up rose old barbara frietchie then
bowed with her fourscore years and ten
bravest of all in frederick town
she took up the flag the men hauled down
in her attic window the staff she set
to show that one heart was loyal yet
up the street came the rebel tread
stonewall jackson riding ahead
under his slouched hat left and right
he glanced; the old flag met his sight
it shivered the window, pane and sash
it rent the banner with seam and gash
quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
dame barbara snatched the silken scarf
she leaned far out on the window-sill
and shook it forth with a royal will
but spare your country's flag," she said
a shade of sadness, a blush of shame
over the face of the leader came
the nobler nature within him stirred
to life at that woman's deed and word
dies like a dog; march on!" he said
all day long through frederick street
sounded the tread of marching feet
all day long that free flag tost
over the heads of the rebel host
ever its torn folds rose and fell
on the loyal winds that loved it well
and through the hill-gaps sunset light
shone over it a warm good night
barbara frietchie's work is o'er
and the rebel rides on his raids no more
honor to her! and let a tear
fall, for her sake, on stonewall's bier
over barbara frietchie's grave
flag of freedom and union wave
peace and order and beauty draw
round thy symbol of light and law
and ever the stars above look down
on thy stars below in frederick town
i started on a journey just about a week ago
for the little town of morrow, in the state of ohio
i never was a traveler, and really didn't know
that morrow had been ridiculed a century or so
i went down to the depot for my ticket and applied
for the tips regarding morrow, not expecting to be guyed
said i, "my friend, i want to go to morrow and return
not later than to-morrow, for i haven't time to burn
said he to me, "now let me see if i have heard you right
you want to go to morrow and come back to-morrow night
you should have gone to morrow yesterday and back to-day
for if you started yesterday to morrow, don't you see
you could have got to morrow and returned to-day at three
the train that started yesterday--now understand me right
to-day it gets to morrow, and returns to-morrow night
said i, "my boy, it seems to me you're talking through your hat
is there a town named morrow on your line? now tell me that
to go from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour trip
the train that goes to morrow leaves to-day eight-thirty-five
half after ten to-morrow is the time it should arrive
now if from here to morrow is a fourteen-hour jump
can you go to-day to morrow and come back to-day, you chump
said i, "i want to go to morrow; can i go to-day
and get to morrow by to-night, if there is no delay
can you go anywhere to-morrow and come back from there to-day
for if to-day you'd get to morrow, surely you'll agree
you should have started not to-day, but yesterday, you see
so if you start to morrow, leaving here to-day, you're flat
you won't get to morrow till the day that follows that
to-morrow into morrow, not to-day, you understand
for the train to-day to morrow, if the schedule is right
will get you into morrow by about to-morrow night
said i, "i guess you know it all, but kindly let me say
how can i go to morrow, if i leave the town to-day
said he, "you cannot go to morrow any more to-day
for the train that goes to morrow is a mile upon its way
i was so disappointed i was mad enough to swear
the train had gone to morrow and had left me standing there
the man was right in telling me i was a howling jay
i didn't go to morrow, so i guess i'll go to-day
the little cares that fretted me
i lost them yesterday
among the fields above the seas
among the winds at play
among the lowing of the herds
the rustling of the trees
among the singing of the birds
the humming of the bees
the foolish fears of what might happen
i cast them all away
among the clover-scented grass
among the new-mown hay
among the husking of the corn
where drowsy poppies nod
where ill thoughts die and good are born
out in the fields with god
i know the song that the bluebird is singing
out in the apple tree where he is swinging
brave little fellow! the skies may be dreary
nothing cares he while his heart is so cheery
hark! how the music leaps out from his throat
hark! was there ever so merry a note
listen a while, and you'll hear what he's saying
up in the apple tree swinging and swaying
you must be weary of winter i know
listen, i'll sing you a message of cheer
summer is coming! and springtime is here
bright yellow crocus! please open your eyes
sweet little violets, hid from the cold
put on your mantles of purple and gold
daffodils! daffodils! say, do you hear
summer is coming, and springtime is here
old ironsides at anchor lay
in the harbor of mahon
a dead calm rested on the bay
the waves to sleep had gone
when little hal, the captain's son
a lad both brave and good
in sport, up shroud and rigging ran
and on the main truck stood
a shudder shot through every vein
all eyes were turned on high
there stood the boy, with dizzy brain
between the sea and sky
no hold had he above, below
alone he stood in air
to that far height none dared to go
no aid could reach him there
we gazed, but not a man could speak
with horror all aghast
in groups, with pallid brow and cheek
we watched the quivering mast
the atmosphere grew thick and hot
and of a lurid hue
as riveted unto the spot
stood officers and crew
the father came on deck:--he gasped
then suddenly a rifle grasped
and aimed it at his son
jump, or i fire," he said
jump, jump, boy!" he obeyed
he sunk,--he rose,--he lived,--he moved
and for the ship struck out
on board we hailed the lad beloved
with many a manly shout
his father drew, in silent joy
those wet arms round his neck
and folded to his heart his boy
then fainted on the deck
i shot an arrow into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for, so swiftly it flew, the sight
could not follow it in its flight
i breathed a song into the air
it fell to earth, i knew not where
for who has sight so keen and strong
that it can follow the flight of song
long, long afterward, in an oak
i found the arrow, still unbroke
and the song, from beginning to end
i found again in the heart of a friend
the justice, laughing, said, "oh no
i only meant the loads of snow
upon the roofs. the barn is weak
i greatly fear the roof will break
so hand me up the spade, my dear
i'll mount the barn, the roof to clear
and if you slip, and fall, and die
how will my living be secured
stephen, your life is not insured
but tie a rope your waist around
and it will hold you safe and sound
all snugly tied, and danger-proof
excelsior! excel--but no
the rope is not secured below
said rachel, "climb, the end to throw
across the top, and i will go
and tie that end around my waist
you always would be tightly laced
rachel, when you became my bride
i thought the knot securely tied
but lest the bond should break in twain
i'll have it fastened once again
below the arm-pits tied around
she takes her station on the ground
while on the roof, beyond the ridge
he shovels clear the lower edge
but, sad mischance! the loosened snow
comes sliding down, to plunge below
and as he tumbles with the slide
up rachel goes on t'other side
just half-way down the justice hung
just half-way up the woman swung
the couple, dangling in the breeze
like turkeys hung outside to freeze
at their rope's end and wits' end, too
shout back and forth what best to do
cried stephen, "take it coolly, wife
all have their ups and downs in life
quoth rachel, "what a pity 'tis
to joke at such a thing as this
a man whose wife is being hung
should know enough to hold his tongue
i see a tempting heap of snow
suppose, my dear, i take my knife
and cut the rope to save my life
she shouted, "don't! 'twould be my death
i see some pointed stones beneath
a better way would be to call
with all our might, for phebe hall
gave tongue; "o phebe! phebe! _phe-e-be_ hall!" in tones both fine
and coarse
enough to make a drover hoarse
now phebe, over at the farm
was sitting, sewing, snug and warm
but hearing, as she thought, her name
sprang up, and to the rescue came
beheld the scene, and thus she thought
and i could reach the lady's foot
i'd draw her downward by the boot
then cut the rope, and let him go
he cannot miss the pile of snow
he sees her moving toward his wife
armed with a chair and carving-knife
and, ere he is aware, perceives
his head ascending to the eaves
and, guessing what the two are at
screams from beneath the roof, "stop that
you make me fall too far, by half
but phebe answers, with a laugh
you've brought your wife to such a plight
and then, with well-directed blows
she cuts the rope and down he goes
the wife untied, they walk around
when lo! no stephen can be found
they call in vain, run to and fro
they look around, above, below
no trace or token can they see
and deeper grows the mystery
then rachel's heart within her sank
but, glancing at the snowy bank
she caught a little gleam of hope
a gentle movement of the rope
they scrape away a little snow
what's this? a hat! ah! he's below
then upward heaves the snowy pile
and forth he stalks in tragic style
unhurt, and with a roguish smile
and rachel sees, with glad surprise
the missing found, the fallen rise
about the time of christmas
when the sky was black
with wrath and rack
and the earth was white with snow
when loudly rang the tumult
of winds and waves of strife
in her home by the sea
with her babe on her knee
sat harry conquest's wife
and he was on the ocean
although she knew not where
for never a lip
could tell of the ship
to lighten her heart's despair
and her babe was fading and dying
the pulse in the tiny wrist
was all but still
and the brow was chill
and pale as the white sea mist
jane conquest's heart was hopeless
she could only weep and pray
that the shepherd mild
would take her child
without a pain away
the night was dark and darker
and the storm grew stronger still
and buried in deep
and dreamless sleep
lay the hamlet under the hill
the fire was dead on the hearthstone
within jane conquest's room
and still sat she
with her babe on her knee
at prayer amid the gloom
when, borne above the tempest
a sound fell on her ear
thrilling her through
for well she knew
and a light leaped in at the lattice
sudden and swift and red
crimsoning all
the whited wall
and the floor, and the roof o'erhead
for one brief moment, heedless
of the babe upon her knee
with the frenzied start
of a frightened heart
upon her feet rose she
and through the quaint old casement
she looks upon the sea
thank god that the sight
she saw that night
so rare a sight should be
hemmed in by many a billow
with mad and foaming lip
a mile from shore
or hardly more
she saw a gallant ship
and to her horror she beheld it
aflame from stem to stern
for there seemed no speck
on all that wreck
where the fierce fire did not burn
till the night was like a sunset
and the sea like a sea of blood
and the rocks and shore
were bathed all o'er
and drenched with the gory flood
she looked and looked, till the terror
went creeping through every limb
and her breath came quick
and her heart grew sick
and her sight grew dizzy and dim
and her lips had lost their utterance
for she tried but could not speak
and her feelings found
no channel of sound
in prayer, or sob, or shriek
once more that cry of anguish
thrilled through the tempest's strife
and it stirred again
in heart and brain
the active thinking life
and the light of an inspiration
leaped to her brightened eye
and on lip and brow
was written now
a purpose pure and high
swiftly she turns, and softly
she crosses the chamber floor
and faltering not
in his tiny cot
she laid the babe she bore
and then with a holy impulse
she sank to her knees, and made
a lowly prayer
in the silence there
and this was the prayer she prayed
and who now dost wear the crown
i at thy feet
o true and sweet
would lay my burden down
thou bad'st me love and cherish
the babe thou gavest me
and i have kept
thy word, nor stept
aside from following thee
and vain is all my care
and my burden's weight
is very great
yea, greater than i can bear
o lord, thou know'st what peril
doth threat these poor men's lives
and i, a woman
most weak and human
do plead for their waiting wives
up, lord, in thy strength, and save
from the scorching breath
of this terrible death
on this cruel winter wave
take thou my babe and watch it
no care is like to thine
and let thy power
in this perilous hour
supply what lack is mine
and so her prayer she ended
and rising to her feet
gave one long look
at the cradle nook
where the child's faint pulses beat
and then with softest footsteps
retrod the chamber floor
and noiselessly groped
for the latch, and oped
and crossed the cottage door
and through the tempest bravely
jane conquest fought her way
by snowy deep
and slippery steep
to where her duty lay
and she journeyed onward, breathless
and weary and sore and faint
yet forward pressed
with the strength, and the zest
and the ardor of a saint
solemn, and weird, and lonely
amid its countless graves
stood the old gray church
on its tall rock perch
secure from the sea and its waves
and beneath its sacred shadow
lay the hamlet safe and still
for however the sea
and the wind might be
there was quiet under the hill
jane conquest reached the churchyard
and stood by the old church door
but the oak was tough
and had bolts enough
and her strength was frail and poor
so she crept through a narrow window
and climbed the belfry stair
and grasped the rope
sole cord of hope
for the mariners in despair
and the wild wind helped her bravely
and she wrought with an earnest will
and the clamorous bell
spoke out right well
to the hamlet under the hill
and it roused the slumbering fishers
nor its warning task gave o'er
till a hundred fleet
and eager feet
were hurrying to the shore
and then it ceased its ringing
for the woman's work was done
and many a boat
that was now afloat
showed man's work had begun
but the ringer in the belfry
lay motionless and cold
with the cord of hope
the church-bell rope
still in her frozen hold
how long she lay it boots not
but she woke from her swoon at last
in her own bright room
to find the gloom
and the grief, and the peril past
with the sense of joy within her
and the christ's sweet presence near
and friends around
and the cooing sound
of her babe's voice in her ear
and they told her all the story
how a brave and gallant few
o'ercame each check
and reached the wreck
and saved the hopeless crew
and how the curious sexton
had climbed the belfry stair
and of his fright
when, cold and white
he found her lying there
and how, when they had borne her
back to her home again
the child she left
with a heart bereft
of hope, and weary with pain
was found within his cradle
in a quiet slumber laid
with a peaceful smile
on his lips the while
and the wasting sickness stayed
and she said "twas the christ who watched it
and brought it safely through
and she praised his truth
and his tender ruth
who had saved her darling too
to drum beat and heart beat
a soldier marches by
there is color in his cheek
there is courage in his eye
yet to drum beat and heart beat
in a moment he must die
by starlight and moonlight
he seeks the britons' camp
he hears the rustling flag
and the armed sentry's tramp
and the starlight and moonlight
his silent wanderings lamp
with a slow tread and still tread
he scans the tented line
and he counts the battery guns
by the gaunt and shadowy pine
and his slow tread and still tread
gives no warning sign
the dark wave, the plumed wave
it meets his eager glance
and it sparkles 'neath the stars
like the glimmer of a lance
a dark wave, a plumed wave
on an emerald expanse
a sharp clang, a steel clang
and terror in the sound
for the sentry, falcon-eyed
in the camp a spy has found
with a sharp clang, a steel clang
the patriot is bound
with calm brow, steady brow
he listens to his doom
in his look there is no fear
nor a shadow trace of gloom
but with calm brow, steady brow
he robes him for the tomb
in the long night, the still night
he kneels upon the sod
and the brutal guards withhold
e'en the solemn word of god
in the long night, the still night
he walks where christ hath trod
he dies upon the tree
and he mourns that he can give
but one life for liberty
and in the blue morn, the sunny morn
his spent wings are free
but his last words, his message words
they burn, lest friendly eye
should read how proud and calm
a patriot could die
with his last words, his dying words
a soldier's battle cry
from fame-leaf and angel-leaf
from monument and urn
the sad of earth, the glad of heaven
his tragic fate shall learn
and on fame-leaf and angel-leaf
the name of hale shall burn
you are coming to woo me, but not as of yore
when i hastened to welcome your ring at the door
for i trusted that he who stood waiting me then
was the brightest, the truest, the noblest of men
your lips on my own when they printed "farewell
had never been soiled by "the beverage of hell
but they come to me now with the bacchanal sign
and the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine
i think of that night in the garden alone
when in whispers you told me your heart was my own
that your love in the future should faithfully be
unshared by another, kept only for me
oh, sweet to my soul is the memory still
of the lips which met mine, when they murmured "i will
but now to their pressure no more they incline
for the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine
o john! how it crushed me, when first in your face
the pen of the "rum fiend" had written "disgrace
and turned me in silence and tears from that breath
all poisoned and foul from the chalice of death
it scattered the hopes i had treasured to last
it darkened the future and clouded the past
it shattered my idol, and ruined the shrine
for the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine
i loved you--oh, dearer than language can tell
and you saw it, you proved it, you knew it too well
but the man of my love was far other than he
who now from the "tap-room" comes reeling to me
in manhood and honor so noble and right
his heart was so true, and his genius so bright
and his soul was unstained, unpolluted by wine
but the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine
you promised reform, but i trusted in vain
your pledge was but made to be broken again
and the lover so false to his promises now
will not, as a husband, be true to his vow
the word must be spoken that bids you depart
though the effort to speak it should shatter my heart
though in silence, with blighted affection, i pine
yet the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine
if one spark in your bosom of virtue remain
go fan it with prayer till it kindle again
resolved, with "god helping," in future to be
from wine and its follies unshackled and free
and when you have conquered this foe of your soul
in manhood and honor beyond his control
this heart will again beat responsive to thine
and the lips free from liquor be welcome to mine
when you come to the end of a perfect day
and you sit alone with your thought
while the chimes ring out with a carol gay
for the joy that the day has brought
do you think what the end of a perfect day
can mean to a tired heart
when the sun goes down with a flaming ray
and the dear friends have to part
well, this is the end of a perfect day
near the end of a journey, too
but it leaves a thought that is big and strong
with a wish that is kind and true
for mem'ry has painted this perfect day
with colors that never fade
and we find, at the end of a perfect day
the soul of a friend we've made
kate ketchem on a winter's night
went to a party dressed in white
her chignon in a net of gold
was about as large as they ever sold
gayly she went, because her "pap
was supposed to be a rich old chap
but when by chance her glances fell
on a friend who had lately married well
her spirits sunk, and a vague unrest
and a nameless longing filled her breast
a wish she wouldn't have had made known
to have an establishment of her own
tom fudge came slowly through the throng
with chestnut hair, worn pretty long
he saw kate ketchem in the crowd
and knowing her slightly, stopped and bowed
then asked her to give him a single flower
saying he'd think it a priceless dower
out from those with which she was decked
she took the poorest she could select
and blushed as she gave it, looking down
to call attention to her gown
flowers must be at that time of year
then several charming remarks he made
asked if she sang, or danced, or played
and being exhausted, inquired whether
she thought it was going to be pleasant weather
and kate displayed her "jewelry
and dropped her lashes becomingly
and listened, with no attempt to disguise
the admiration in her eyes
at last, like one who has nothing to say
he turned around and walked away
kate ketchem smiled, and said, "you bet
i'll catch that fudge and his money yet
he's rich enough to keep me in clothes
and i think i could manage him as i chose
he could aid my father as well as not
and buy my brother a splendid yacht
my mother for money should never fret
and all it cried for the baby should get
and after that, with what he could spare
i'd make a show at a charity fair
tom fudge looked back as he crossed the sill
and saw kate ketchem standing still
it isn't an easy thing to find
and every thing that she has to wear
proves her as rich as she is fair
would she were mine, and i to-day
had the old man's cash my debts to pay
no creditors with a long account
no tradesmen wanting 'that little amount
but all my scores paid up when due
by a father-in-law as rich as a jew
but he thought of her brother, not worth a straw
and her mother, that would be his, in law
so, undecided, he walked along
and kate was left alone in the throng
but a lawyer smiled, whom he sought by stealth
to ascertain old ketchem's wealth
and as for kate, she schemed and planned
till one of the dancers claimed her hand
he married her for her father's cash
she married him to cut a dash
but as to paying his debts, do you know
the father couldn't see it so
and at hints for help, kate's hazel eyes
looked out in their innocent surprise
and when tom thought of the way he had wed
he longed for a single life instead
and closed his eyes in a sulky mood
regretting the days of his bachelorhood
and said, in a sort of reckless vein
if i were free, as on that night
when i saw kate ketchem dressed in white
she wedded him to be rich and gay
but husband and children didn't pay
he wasn't the prize she hoped to draw
and wouldn't live with his mother-in-law
and oft when she had to coax and pout
in order to get him to take her out
she thought how very attentive and bright
he seemed at the party that winter's night
of his laugh, as soft as a breeze of the south
how he praised her dress and gems in his talk
as he took a careful account of stock
sometimes she hated the very walls
hated her friends, her dinners, and calls
till her weak affection, to hatred turned
like a dying tallow-candle burned
and for him who sat there, her peace to mar
smoking his everlasting cigar
he wasn't the man she thought she saw
and grief was duty, and hate was law
so she took up her burden with a groan
saying only, "i might have known
alas for kate! and alas for fudge
though i do not owe them any grudge
and alas for any who find to their shame
that two can play at their little game
for of all hard things to bear and grin
the hardest is knowing you're taken in
ah, well! as a general thing, we fret
about the one we didn't get
but i think we needn't make a fuss
if the one we don't want didn't get us
by the old moulmein pagoda, lookin' eastward to the sea
there's a burma girl a-settin', an' i know she thinks o' me
for the wind is in the palm-trees, an' the temple-bells they say
come you back to mandalay
where the old flotilla lay
can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from rangoon to mandalay
on the road to mandalay
where the flyin'-fishes play
an' the dawn comes up like thunder outer china 'crost the bay
an' 'er name was supi-yaw-lat--jes' the same as theebaw's queen
an' i seed her fust a-smokin' of a whackin' white cheroot
an' a-wastin' christian kisses on an 'eathen idol's foot
bloomin' idol made o' mud
wot they called the great gawd budd
plucky lot she cared for idols when i kissed 'er where she stud
on the road to mandalay
when the mist was on the rice-fields an' the sun was droppin' low
she'd git 'er little banjo an' she'd sing "_kul-la-lo-lo
with 'er arm upon my shoulder an' her cheek agin my cheek
we useter watch the steamers and the _hathis_ pilin' teak
elephints a-pilin' teak
in the sludgy, squdgy creek
where the silence 'ung that 'eavy you was arf afraid to speak
on the road to mandalay
but that's all shove be'ind me--long ago an' fur away
an' there ain't no 'buses runnin' from the benk to mandalay
an' i'm learnin' 'ere in london what the ten-year sodger tells
no! you won't 'eed nothin' else
but them spicy garlic smells
an' the sunshine an' the palm-trees an' the tinkly temple-bells
on the road to mandalay
i am sick o' wastin' leather on these gutty pavin'-stones
an' the blasted henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
tho' i walks with fifty 'ousemaids outer chelsea to the strand
an' they talk a lot o' lovin', but wot do they understand
beefy face an' grubby 'and
law! wot _do_ they understand
i've a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land
on the road to mandalay
ship me somewheres east of suez where the best is like the worst
where there aren't no ten commandments, an' a man can raise a thirst
for the temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that i would be
by the old moulmein pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea
on the road to mandalay
where the old flotilla lay
with our sick beneath the awnings when we went to mandalay
on the road to mandalay
where the flyin'-fishes play
an' the dawn comes up like thunder outer china 'crost the bay
behind him lay the gray azores
behind the gates of hercules
before him not the ghost of shores
before him only shoreless seas
the good mate said: "now must we pray
for lo! the very stars are gone
brave adm'r'l, speak; what shall i say
my men grow ghastly wan and weak
the stout mate thought of home; a spray
of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek
if we sight naught but seas at dawn
they sailed and sailed, as winds might blow
until at last the blanched mate said
should i and all my men fall dead
these very winds forget their way
for god from these dread seas is gone
now speak, brave adm'r'l, speak and say
he said: "sail on! sail on! and on
they sailed. they sailed. then spake the mate
he curls his lips, he lies in wait
with lifted teeth, as if to bite
brave adm'r'l, say but one good word
what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leapt like a leaping sword
then, pale and worn, he kept his deck
and peered through darkness. ah, that night
of all dark nights! and then a speck
a light! a light! a light! a light
it grew, a starlit flag unfurled
it grew to be time's burst of dawn
he gained a world; he gave that world
its grandest lesson; "on! sail on
my sister's best feller is 'most six-foot-three
and handsome and strong as a feller can be
and sis, she's so little, and slender, and small
you never would think she could boss him at all
but, my jing
she don't do a thing
but make him jump 'round, like he worked with a string
it jest made me 'shamed of him sometimes, you know
to think that he'll let a girl bully him so
he goes to walk with her and carries her muff
and coat and umbrella, and that kind of stuff
she loads him with things that must weigh 'most a ton
and, honest, he _likes_ it,--as if it was fun
and, oh, say
when they go to a play
he'll sit in the parlor and fidget away
and she won't come down till it's quarter past eight
and then she'll scold _him_ 'cause they get there so late
he spends heaps of money a-buyin' her things
like candy, and flowers, and presents, and rings
and all he's got for 'em's a handkerchief case
a fussed-up concern, made of ribbons and lace
but, my land! he thinks it's just grand
he calls her "an angel"--i heard him--and "saint
and "beautif'lest bein' on earth"--but she ain't
i just make her coax me, and give me a dime
but that great big silly--why, honest and true
he'd run forty miles if she wanted him to
oh, gee whiz
i tell you what 'tis
i jest think it's _awful_--those actions of his
i won't fall in love, when i'm grown--no sir-ee
my sister's best feller's a warnin' to me
out where the handclasp's a little stronger
out where a smile dwells a little longer
that's where the west begins
out where the sun's a little brighter
where the snow that falls is a trifle whiter
where the bonds of home are a wee bit tighter
that's where the west begins
out where the skies are a trifle bluer
out where friendship's a little truer
that's where the west begins
out where a fresher breeze is blowing
where there is laughter in every streamlet flowing
where there's more of reaping and less of sowing
that's where the west begins
out where the world is in the making
where fewer hearts with despair are aching
that's where the west begins
where there is more of singing and less of sighing
where there is more of giving and less of buying
and a man makes friends without half trying
that's where the west begins
let us take to our hearts a lesson--no lesson can braver be
from the ways of the tapestry weavers on the other side of the sea
above their heads the pattern hangs, they study it with care
the while their fingers deftly move, their eyes are fastened there
they tell this curious thing, besides, of the patient, plodding weaver
he works on the wrong side evermore, but works for the right side ever
it is only when the weaving stops, and the web is loosed and turned
that he sees his real handiwork--that his marvelous skill is learned
ah, the sight of its delicate beauty, how it pays him for all his cost
no rarer, daintier work than his was ever done by the frost
then the master bringeth him golden hire, and giveth him praise as well
and how happy the heart of the weaver is, no tongue but his can tell
the years of man are the looms of god, let down from the place of the sun
wherein we are weaving ever, till the mystic web is done
weaving blindly but weaving surely each for himself his fate
we may not see how the right side looks, we can only weave and wait
but, looking above for the pattern, no weaver hath to fear
only let him look clear into heaven, the perfect pattern is there
if he keeps the face of the savior forever and always in sight
his toil shall be sweeter than honey, his weaving sure to be right
and when the work is ended, and the web is turned and shown
he shall hear the voice of the master, it shall say unto him, "well done
and the white-winged angels of heaven, to bear him shall come down
and god shall give him gold for his hire--not a coin--but a glowing crown
when the teacher gets cross, and her blue eyes gets black
and the pencil comes down on the desk with a whack
we chillen all sit up straight in a line
as if we had rulers instead of a spine
and it's scary to cough, and it a'n't safe to grin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in
when the teacher gets cross, the tables get mixed
the ones and the twos begins to play tricks
the pluses and minuses is just little smears
when the cry babies cry their slates full of tears
and the figgers won't add,--but just act up like sin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in
when the teacher gets cross, the reading gets bad
the lines jingle round till the' chillen is sad
and billy boy puffs and gets red in the face
as if he and the lesson were running a race
until she hollers out, "next!" as sharp as a pin
when the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in
when the teacher gets good, her smile is so bright
that the tables gets straight, and the reading gets right
the pluses and minuses comes trooping along
and the figgers add up and stop being wrong
and we chillen would like, but we dassent, to shout
when the teacher gets good, and the dimples comes out
god of our fathers, known of old
lord of our far-flung battle line
beneath whose awful hand we hold
dominion over palm and pine
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
the tumult and the shouting dies
the captains and the kings depart
still stands thine ancient sacrifice
an humble and a contrite heart
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
far-called, our navies melt away
on dune and headland sinks the fire
lo, all our pomp of yesterday
is one with nineveh and tyre
judge of the nations, spare us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
if, drunk with sight of power, we loose
wild tongues that have not thee in awe
such boasting as the gentiles use
or lesser breeds without the law
lord god of hosts, be with us yet
lest we forget--lest we forget
for heathen heart that puts her trust
in reeking tube and iron shard
all valiant dust that builds on dust
and guarding, calls not thee to guard
for frantic boast and foolish word
thy mercy on thy people, lord
o friends! with whom my feet have trod
the quiet aisles of prayer
glad witness to your zeal for god
and love of man i bear
i trace your lines of argument
your logic linked and strong
i weigh as one who dreads dissent
and fears a doubt as wrong
but still my human hands are weak
to hold your iron creeds
against the words ye bid me speak
my heart within me pleads
who fathoms the eternal thought
who talks of scheme and plan
the lord is god! he needeth not
the poor device of man
i walk with bare, hushed feet the ground
ye tread with boldness shod
i dare not fix with mete and bound
the love and power of god
ye praise his justice; even such
his pitying love i deem
ye seek a king; i fain would touch
the robe that hath no seam
ye see the curse which overbroods
a world of pain and loss
i hear our lord's beatitudes
and prayer upon the cross
more than your schoolmen teach, within
myself, alas! i know
too dark ye cannot paint the sin
too small the merit show
i bow my forehead to the dust
i veil mine eyes for shame
and urge, in trembling self-distrust
a prayer without a claim
i see the wrong that round me lies
i feel the guilt within
i hear, with groan and travail-cries
the world confess its sin
yet, in the maddening maze of things
and tossed by storm and flood
to one fixed stake my spirit clings
i know that god is good
not mine to look where cherubim
and seraphs may not see
but nothing can be good in him
which evil is in me
the wrong that pains my soul below
i dare not throne above
i know not of his hate,--i know
his goodness and his love
i dimly guess from blessings known
of greater out of sight
and, with the chastened psalmist, own
his judgments too are right
i long for household voices gone
for vanished smiles i long
but god hath led my dear ones on
and he can do no wrong
i know not what the future hath
of marvel or surprise
assured alone that life and death
his mercy underlies
and if my heart and flesh are weak
to bear an untried pain
the bruised reed he will not break
but strengthen and sustain
no offering of my own i have
nor works my faith to prove
i can but give the gifts he gave
and plead his love for love
and so beside the silent sea
i wait the muffled oar
no harm from him can come to me
on ocean or on shore
i know not where his islands lift
their fronded palms in air
i only know i cannot drift
beyond his love and care
o brothers! if my faith is vain
if hopes like these betray
pray for me that my feet may gain
the sure and safer way
and thou, o lord! by whom are seen
thy creatures as they be
forgive me if too close i lean
my human heart on thee
out of the clover and blue-eyed grass
he turned them into the river-lane
one after another he let them pass
then fastened the meadow-bars again
under the willows and over the hill
he patiently followed their sober pace
the merry whistle for once was still
and something shadowed the sunny face
only a boy! and his father had said
he never could let his youngest go
two already were lying dead
under the feet of the trampling foe
but after the evening work was done
and the frogs were loud in the meadow swamp
over his shoulder he slung his gun
and stealthily followed the footpath damp
across the clover and through the wheat
with resolute heart and purpose grim
though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet
and the blind bat's flitting startled him
thrice since then had the lanes been white
and the orchards sweet with apple bloom
and now, when the cows came back at night
the feeble father drove them home
for news had come to the lonely farm
that three were lying where two had lain
and the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
could never lean on a son's again
the summer day grew cool and late
he went for the cows when the work was done
but down the lane, as he opened the gate
he saw them coming, one by one
brindle, ebony, speckle, and bess
shaking their horns in the evening wind
cropping the buttercups out of the grass
but who was it following close behind
loosely swung in the idle air
the empty sleeve of army blue
and worn and pale, from the crisping hair
looked out a face that the father knew
for southern prisons will sometimes yawn
and yield their dead unto life again
and the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
in golden glory at last may wane
the great tears sprang to their meeting eyes
for the heart must speak when the lips are dumb
and under the silent evening skies
together they followed the cattle home
your flag and my flag
and, oh, how much it holds
your land and my land
secure within its folds
your heart and my heart
beat quicker at the sight
sun-kissed and wind-tossed
red and blue and white
the one flag--the great flag--the flag for me and you
glorified all else beside--the red and white and blue
your flag and my flag
to every star and stripe
the drums beat as hearts beat
and fifers shrilly pipe
your flag and my flag
a blessing in the sky
your hope and my hope
it never hid a lie
home land and far land and half the world around
old glory hears our glad salute and ripples to the sound
oh! they've swept the parlor carpet, and they've dusted every chair
and they've got the tidies hangin' jest exactly on the square
and the what-not's fixed up lovely, and the mats have all been beat
and the pantry's brimmin' over with the bully things ter eat
sis has got her sunday dress on, and she's frizzin' up her bangs
ma's got on her best alpacky, and she's askin' how it hangs
and it's all because we're goin' ter have the minister ter tea
oh! the table's fixed up gaudy, with the gilt-edged chiny set
and we'll use the silver tea-pot and the comp'ny spoons, you bet
and we're goin' ter have some fruitcake and some thimbleberry jam
and "riz biscuits," and some doughnuts, and some chicken, and some ham
ma, she'll 'polergize like fury and say everything is bad
and "sich awful luck with cookin'," she is sure she never had
but, er course, she's only bluffin,' for it's as prime as it can be
and she's only talkin' that way 'cause the minister's ter tea
everybody'll be a-smilin' and as good as ever was
pa  won't growl about the vittles, like he generally does
and he'll ask me would i like another piece er pie; but, sho
that, er course, is only manners, and i'm s'posed ter answer "no
sis'll talk about the church-work and about the sunday-school
ma'll tell how she liked that sermon that was on the golden rule
and if i upset my tumbler they won't say a word ter me
yes, a boy can eat in comfort with the minister ter tea
say! a minister, you'd reckon, never'd say what wasn't true
but that isn't so with ours, and i jest can prove it, too
why, he sets and says it's lovely; and that, seems ter me,'s a lie
but i like him all the samey, and i only wish he'd stay
at our house fer good and always, and eat with us every day
only think of havin' goodies _every_ evenin'! jimmin_ee
and i'd _never_ git a scoldin' with the minister ter tea
when klingle, klangle, klingle
far down the dusty dingle
the cows are coming home
now sweet and clear, now faint and low
the airy tinklings come and go
like chimings from the far-off tower
or patterings of an april shower
that makes the daisies grow
ko-ling, ko-lang, kolinglelingle
far down the darkening dingle
the cows come slowly home
and old-time friends, and twilight plays
and starry nights and sunny days
come trooping up the misty ways
when the cows come home
with jingle, jangle, jingle
soft tones that sweetly mingle
the cows are coming home
malvine, and pearl, and florimel
dekamp, red rose, and gretchen schell
queen bess and sylph, and spangled sue
across the fields i hear her "loo-oo
and clang her silver bell
go-ling, go-lang, golingledingle
with faint, far sounds that mingle
the cows come slowly home
and mother-songs of long-gone years
and baby-joys and childish fears
and youthful hopes and youthful tears
when the cows come home
with ringle, rangle, ringle
by twos and threes and single
the cows are coming home
through violet air we see the town
and the summer sun a-sliding down
and the maple in the hazel glade
throws down the path a longer shade
and the hills are growing brown
to-ring, to-rang, toringleringle
by threes and fours and single
the cows come slowly home
the same sweet sound of wordless psalm
the same sweet june-day rest and calm
the same sweet smell of buds and balm
when the cows come home
with tinkle, tankle, tinkle
through fern and periwinkle
the cows are coming home
a-loitering in the checkered stream
where the sun-rays glance and gleam
clarine, peach-bloom and phebe phillis
stand knee-deep in the creamy lilies
in a drowsy dream
to-link, to-lank, tolinklelinkle
o'er banks with buttercups a-twinkle
the cows come slowly home
and up through memory's deep ravine
come the brook's old song and its old-time sheen
and the crescent of the silver queen
when the cows come home
with klingle, klangle, klingle
with loo-oo, and moo-oo and jingle
the cows are coming home
and over there on merlin hill
sounds the plaintive cry of the whip-poor-will
and the dew-drops lie on the tangled vines
and over the poplars venus shines
and over the silent mill
ko-ling, ko-lang, kolinglelingle
with ting-a-ling and jingle
the cows come slowly home
let down the bars; let in the train
of long-gone songs, and flowers, and rain
for dear old times come back again
when the cows come home
dead! is it possible? he, the bold rider
custer, our hero, the first in the fight
charming the bullets of yore to fly wider
shunning our battle-king's ringlets of light
dead! our young chieftain, and dead all forsaken
no one to tell us the way of his fall
slain in the desert, and never to waken
never, not even to victory's call
comrades, he's gone! but ye need not be grieving
no, may my death be like his when i die
no regrets wasted on words i am leaving
falling with brave men, and face to the sky
death's but a journey, the greatest must take it
fame is eternal, and better than all
gold though the bowl be, 'tis fate that must break it
glory can hallow the fragments that fall
proud for his fame that last day that he met them
all the night long he had been on their track
scorning their traps and the men that had set them
wild for a charge that should never give back
there, on the hilltop he halted and saw them
lodges all loosened and ready to fly
hurrying scouts with the tidings to awe them
told of his coming before he was nigh
all the wide valley was full of their forces
gathered to cover the lodges' retreat
warriors running in haste to their horses
thousands of enemies close to his feet
down in the valleys the ages had hollowed
there lay the sitting bull's camp for a prey
numbers! what recked he? what recked those who followed
men who had fought ten to one ere that day
out swept the squadrons, the fated three hundred
into the battle-line steady and full
then down the hillside exultingly thundered
into the hordes of the old sitting bull
wild ogalallah, arapahoe, cheyenne
wild horse's braves, and the rest of their crew
shrank from that charge like a herd from a lion
then closed around the great hell of wild sioux
right to their center he charged, and then, facing
hark to those yells and around them, oh, see
over the hilltops the devils come racing
coming as fast as the waves of the sea
red was the circle of fire about them
no hope of victory, no ray of light
shot through that terrible black cloud about them
brooding in death over custer's last fight
then did he blench? did he die like a craven
begging those torturing fiends for his life
was there a soldier who carried the seven
flinched like a coward or fled from the strife
no, by the blood of our custer, no quailing
there in the midst of the devils they close
hemmed in by thousands, but ever assailing
fighting like tigers, all bayed amid foes
thicker and thicker the bullets came singing
down go the horses and riders and all
swiftly the warriors round them were ringing
circling like buzzards awaiting their fall
see the wild steeds of the mountain and prairie
savage eyes gleaming from forests of mane
quivering lances with pennons so airy
war-painted warriors charging amain
backward again and again they were driven
shrinking to close with the lost little band
never a cap that had worn the bright seven
bowed till its wearer was dead on the strand
closer and closer the death-circle growing
even the leader's voice, clarion clear
rang out his words of encouragement glowing
dearly they sold them, like berserkers raging
facing the death that encircled them round
death's bitter pangs by their vengeance assuaging
marking their tracks by their dead on the ground
comrades, our children shall yet tell their story
custer's last charge on the old sitting bull
and ages shall swear that the cup of his glory
needed but that death to render it full
what's the matter, stummick? ain't i always been your friend
ain't i always been a pardner to you? all my pennies don't i spend
in getting nice things for you? don't i give you lots of cake
say, stummick, what's the matter, you had to go an' ache
why, i loaded you with good things yesterday
i gave you more corn an' chicken than you'd ever had before
i gave you fruit an' candy, apple pie an' chocolate cake
an' last night when i got to bed you had to go an' ache
say, what's the matter with you? ain't you satisfied at all
i gave you all you wanted; you was hard jes' like a ball
an' you couldn't hold another bit of puddin'; yet last night
you ached most awful, stummick! that ain't treatin' me jest right
i've been a friend to you, i have! why ain't you a friend o' mine
they gave me castor oil becoz you made me whine
i'm feelin' fine this mornin'; yes it's true
but i tell you, stummick, you better appreciate things i do for you
in the sunshine bright and strong
for this world is fading, pompey
massa won't be with you long
and i fain would hear the south wind
bring once more the sound to me
of the wavelets softly breaking
on the shores of tennessee
as they still the story tell
how no vessels float the banner
that i've loved so long and well
i shall listen to their music
dreaming that again i see
stars and stripes on sloop and shallop
sailing up the tennessee
for death's last dispatch to come
if that exiled starry banner
should come proudly sailing home
you shall greet it, slave no longer
voice and hand shall both be free
that shout and point to union colors
on the waves of tennessee
but old darkey's happy here
where he's tended corn and cotton
for dese many a long-gone year
ober yonder, missis' sleeping
no one tends her grave like me
mebbe she would miss the flowers
she used to love in tennessee
if pompey should beside him stay
mebbe she'd remember better
how for him she used to pray
telling him that way up yonder
white as snow his soul would be
if he served the lord of heaven
while he lived in tennessee
silently the tears were rolling
down the poor old dusky face
as he stepped behind his master
in his long-accustomed place
then a silence fell around them
as they gazed on rock and tree
pictured in the placid waters
of the rolling tennessee
master, dreaming of the battle
where he fought by marion's side
where he bid the haughty tarleton
stoop his lordly crest of pride
man, remembering how yon sleeper
once he held upon his knee
ere she loved the gallant soldier
ralph vervair of tennessee
still the south wind fondly lingers
still the bondman, close beside him
stands behind the old arm-chair
with his dark-hued hand uplifted
shading eyes, he bends to see
where the woodland, boldly jutting
turns aside the tennessee
thus he watches cloud-born shadows
glide from tree to mountain-crest
softly creeping, aye and ever
to the river's yielding breast
ha! above the foliage yonder
something flutters wild and free
the flag's come back to tennessee
help me stand on foot once more
that i may salute the colors
as they pass my cabin door
here's the paper signed that frees you
give a freeman's shout with me
evermore in tennessee
then the trembling voice grew fainter
and the limbs refused to stand
one prayer to jesus--and the soldier
glided to the better land
when the flag went down the river
man and master both were free
while the ring-dove's note was mingled
with the rippling tennessee
it was a hundred years ago
when, by the woodland ways
the traveler saw the wild deer drink
or crop the birchen sprays
beneath a hill, whose rocky side
o'er-browed a grassy mead
and fenced a cottage from the wind
a deer was wont to feed
she only came when on the cliffs
the evening moonlight lay
and no man knew the secret haunts
in which she walked by day
white were her feet, her forehead showed
a spot of silvery white
that seemed to glimmer like a star
in autumn's hazy night
and here, when sang the whippoorwill
she cropped the sprouting leaves
and here her rustling steps were heard
on still october eves
but when the broad midsummer moon
rose o'er the grassy lawn
beside the silver-footed deer
there grazed a spotted fawn
the cottage dame forbade her son
to aim the rifle here
or fright that friendly deer
ten peaceful years and more
and ever, when the moonlight shines
she feeds before our door
a thousand moons ago
they never raise the war whoop here
and never twang the bow
and think that all is well
while such a gentle creature haunts
the place in which we dwell
the youth obeyed, and sought for game
in forests far away
where, deep in silence and in moss
the ancient woodland lay
but once, in autumn's golden time
he ranged the wild in vain
nor roused the pheasant nor the deer
and wandered home again
the crescent moon and crimson eve
shone with a mingling light
the deer, upon the grassy mead
was feeding full in sight
he raised the rifle to his eye
and from the cliffs around
a sudden echo, shrill and sharp
gave back its deadly sound
away, into the neighboring wood
the startled creature flew
and crimson drops at morning lay
amid the glimmering dew
next evening shone the waxing moon
as sweetly as before
the deer upon the grassy mead
was seen again no more
but ere that crescent moon was old
by night the red men came
and burnt the cottage to the ground
and slew the youth and dame
now woods have overgrown the mead
and hid the cliffs from sight
there shrieks the hovering hawk at noon
and prowls the fox at night
where potomac's stream is flowing
virginia's border through
where the white-sailed ships are going
sailing to the ocean blue
hushed the sound of mirth and singing
silent every one
while the solemn bells are ringing
by the tomb of washington
tolling and knelling
with a sad, sweet sound
o'er the waves the tones are swelling
by mount vernon's sacred ground
long ago the warrior slumbered
our country's father slept
long among the angels numbered
they the hero soul have kept
but the children's children love him
and his name revere
so where willows wave above him
sweetly still his knell you hear
sail, oh ships, across the billows
and bear the story far
how he sleeps beneath the willows
tell while sweet adieus are swelling
till you come again
he within the hearts is dwelling
of his loving countrymen
heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to the summit round by round
i count this thing to be grandly true
that a noble deed is a step toward god
lifting a soul from the common sod
to a purer air and a broader view
we rise by things that are under our feet
by what we have mastered of good and gain
by the pride deposed and the passion slain
and the vanquished ills that we hourly meet
we hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust
when the morning calls us to life and light
but our hearts grow weary, and ere he night
our lives are trailing the sordid dust
we hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray
and we think that we mount the air on wings
beyond the recall of sensual things
while our feet still cling to the heavy clay
only in dreams is a ladder thrown
from the weary earth to the sapphire walls
but the dreams depart, and the vision falls
and the sleeper awakes on his pillow of stone
heaven is not reached at a single bound
but we build the ladder by which we rise
from the lowly earth to the vaulted skies
and we mount to the summit round by round
mr. finney had a turnip
and it grew behind the barn
it grew there, and it grew there
and the turnip did no harm
it grew and it grew
till it could get no taller
mr. finney pulled it up
and put it in his cellar
it lay there and it lay there
till it began to rot
his daughter sallie took it up
and put it in the pot
she boiled it, and she boiled it
as long as she was able
his daughter peggy fished it out
and put it on the table
mr. finney and his wife
they sat down to sup
and they ate, and they ate
until they ate the turnip up
under a spreading chestnut tree
the village smithy stands
the smith, a mighty man is he
with large and sinewy hands
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands
his hair is crisp, and black and long
his face is like the tan
his brow is wet with honest sweat
he earns whate'er he can
and looks the whole world in the face
for he owes not any man
week in, week out, from morn till night
you can hear his bellows blow
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge
with measured beat and slow
like a sexton ringing the village bell
when the evening sun is low
and children coming home from school
look in at the open door
they love to see the flaming forge
and hear the bellows roar
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing floor
he goes on sunday to the church
and sits among his boys
he hears the parson pray and preach
he hears his daughter's voice
singing in the village choir
and it makes his heart rejoice
it sounds to him like her mother's voice
singing in paradise
he needs must think of her once more
how in the grave she lies
and with his hard, rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes
toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing
onward through life he goes
each morning sees some task begun
each evening sees it close
something attempted, something done
has earned a night's repose
thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend
for the lesson thou hast taught
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought
every one of you won the war
you and you and you
each one knowing what it was for
and what was his job to do
every one of you won the war
obedient, unwearied, unknown
dung in the trenches, drift on the shore
dust to the world's end blown
every one of you, steady and true
you and you and you
down in the pit or up in the blue
whether you crawled or sailed or flew
whether your closest comrade knew
or you bore the brunt alone
all of you, all of you, name after name
jones and robinson, smith and brown
you from the piping prairie town
you from the fundy fogs that came
you from the city's roaring blocks
you from the bleak new england rocks
with the shingled roof in the apple boughs
you from the brown adobe house
you from the rockies, you from the coast
you from the burning frontier-post
and you from the klondyke's frozen flanks
you from the cedar-swamps, you from the pine
you from the cotton and you from the vine
you from the rice and the sugar-brakes
you from the rivers and you from the lakes
you from the creeks and you from the licks
and you from the brown bayou
you and you and you
you from the pulpit, you from the mine
you from the factories, you from the banks
closer and closer, ranks on ranks
airplanes and cannon, and rifles and tanks
smith and robinson, brown and jones
ruddy faces or bleaching bones
after the turmoil and blood and pain
swinging home to the folks again
or sleeping alone in the fine french rain
every one of you won the war
every one of you won the war
you and you and you
pressing and pouring forth, more and more
toiling and straining from shore to shore
to reach the flaming edge of the dark
where man in his millions went up like a spark
you, in your thousands and millions coming
all the sea ploughed with you, all the air humming
all the land loud with you
all our hearts proud with you
all our souls bowed with the awe of your coming
where's the arch high enough
lads, to receive you
where's the eye dry enough
dears, to perceive you
when at last and at last in your glory you come
tramping home
every one of you won the war
you and you and you
you that carry an unscathed head
you that halt with a broken tread
and oh, most of all, you dead, you dead
lift up the gates for these that are last
that are last in the great procession
let the living pour in, take possession
flood back to the city, the ranch, the farm
the church and the college and mill
back to the office, the store, the exchange
back to the wife with the babe on her arm
back to the mother that waits on the sill
and the supper that's hot on the range
and now, when the last of them all are by
be the gates lifted up on high
to let those others in
those others, their brothers, that softly tread
that come so thick, yet take no ground
that are so many, yet make no sound
our dead, our dead, our dead
o silent and secretly-moving throng
in your fifty thousand strong
coming at dusk when the wreaths have dropt
and streets are empty, and music stopt
silently coming to hearts that wait
dumb in the door and dumb at the gate
and hear your step and fly to your call
every one of you won the war
but you, you dead, most of all
the snow had begun in the gloaming
and busily all the night
had been heaping field and highway
with a silence deep and white
every pine and fir and hemlock
wore ermine too dear for an earl
and the poorest twig on the elm tree
was ridged inch-deep with pearl
from sheds new-roofed with carrara
came chanticleer's muffled crow
the stiff rails were softened to swan's-down
and still fluttered down the snow
i stood and watched by the window
the noiseless work of the sky
and the sudden flurries of snow-birds
like brown leaves whirling by
i thought of a mound in sweet auburn
where a little headstone stood
how the flakes were folding it gently
as did robins the babes in the wood
up spoke our own little mabel
saying, "father, who makes it snow
and i told of the good all-father
who cares for us here below
again i looked at the snow-fall
and thought of the leaden sky
that arched o'er our first great sorrow
when that mound was heaped so high
i remembered the gradual patience
that fell from that cloud like snow
flake by flake, healing and hiding
the scar of our deep-plunged woe
and again to the child i whispered
darling, the merciful father
alone can make it fall
then, with eyes that saw not, i kissed her
and she, kissing back, could not know
that _my_ kiss was given to her sister
folded close under deepening snow
by the rude bridge that arched the flood
their flag to april's breeze unfurled
here once the embattled farmers stood
and fired the shot heard round the world
the foe long since in silence slept
alike the conqueror silent sleeps
and time the ruined bridge has swept
down the dark stream which seaward creeps
on this green bank, by this soft stream
we set to-day a votive stone
that memory may their deed redeem
when, like our sires, our sons are gone
spirit, that made these heroes dare
to die, to leave their children free
bid time and nature gently spare
the shaft we raise to them and thee
it looked extremely rocky for the mudville nine that day
the score stood two to four with but an inning left to play
so, when cooney died at second, and burrows did the same
a pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game
a straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest
with that hope which springs eternal within the human breast
for they thought: "if only casey could get a whack at that
they'd put up even money now, with casey at the bat
but flynn preceded casey, and likewise so did blake
and the former was a puddin', and the latter was a fake
so on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat
for there seemed but little chance of casey's getting to the bat
but flynn let drive a "single," to the wonderment of all
and the much-despised blakey "tore the cover off the ball
and when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
there was blakey safe at second, and flynn a-huggin' third
then, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell
it rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell
it struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat
for casey, mighty casey, was advancing to the bat
there was ease in casey's manner as he stepped into his place
there was pride in casey's bearing, and a smile on casey's face
and when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat
no stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas casey at the bat
ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt
then while the new york pitcher ground the ball into his hip
defiance gleamed in casey's eye, a sneer curled casey's lip
and now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
and casey stood a-watching it in  haughty grandeur there
close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
from the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar
like the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore
and it's likely they'd have killed him had not casey raised a hand
with a smile of christian charity great casey's visage shone
he stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on
he signaled to sir timothy, once more the spheroid flew
but casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "strike two
but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed
they saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain
and they knew that casey wouldn't let that ball go by again
the sneer is gone from casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
and now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go
and now the air is shattered by the force of casey's blow
oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright
the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light
and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout
but there is no joy in mudville--mighty casey has struck out
there were saddened hearts in mudville for a week or even more
there were muttered oaths and curses--every fan in town was sore
and then to think he'd go and spring a bush league trick like that
all his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless "shine
they called him "strike-out casey" from the mayor down the line
and as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh
while a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty casey's eye
the lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again
and fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men
and casey smiled--his rugged face no longer wore a frown
the pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town
all mudville has assembled; ten thousand fans had come
to see the twirler who had put big casey on the bum
and when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild
he doffed his cap in proud disdain--but casey only smiled
but in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan
who thought that mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun
their hopes sank low--the rival team was leading "four to one
the last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score
but when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar
the din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard
when the pitcher hit the second and gave "four balls" to the third
three men on base--nobody out--three runs to tie the game
a triple meant the highest niche in mudville's hall of fame
but here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night
when the fourth one "fouled to catcher," and the fifth "flew out to right
a dismal groan in chorus came--a scowl was on each face
when casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place
his bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate
he gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate
but fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away
there were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day
they hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, "strike him out
but casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout
the pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread
another hiss, another groan--"strike one!" the umpire said
zip! like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee
no roasting for the umpire now--his was an easy lot
but here the pitcher twirled again--was that a rifle shot
a whack; a crack; and out through space the leather pellet flew
a blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue
above the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight
the sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight
ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit
but no one ever found the ball that mighty casey hit
oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun
and somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun
and somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall
but mudville hearts are happy now--for casey hit the ball
backward, turn backward, o time, in your flight
make me a child again just for tonight
mother, come back from the echoless shore
take me again to your heart as of yore
kiss from my forehead the furrows of care
smooth the few silver threads out of my hair
over my slumbers your loving watch keep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
backward, flow backward, o tide of the years
i am so weary of toil and of tears
toil without recompense, tears all in vain
take them, and give me my childhood again
i have grown weary of dust and decay
weary of flinging my soul-wealth away
weary of sowing for others to reap
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue
mother, o mother, my heart calls for you
many a summer the grass has grown green
blossomed and faded, our faces between
yet with strong yearning and passionate pain
long i to-night for your presence again
come from the silence so long and so deep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
over my heart, in the days that are flown
no love like mother-love ever has shone
no other worship abides and endures
faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours
none like a mother can charm away pain
from the sick soul and the world-weary brain
slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold
fall on your shoulders again as of old
let it drop over my forehead to-night
shading my faint eyes away from the light
for with its sunny-edged shadows once more
haply will throng the sweet visions of yore
lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
mother, dear mother, the years have been long
since i last listened your lullaby song
sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem
womanhood's years have been only a dream
clasped to your breast in a loving embrace
with your light lashes just sweeping my face
never hereafter to wake or to weep
rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep
my child, ah, my child; thou art weary to-night
thy spirit is sad, and dim is the light
thou wouldst call me back from the echoless shore
to the trials of life, to thy heart as of yore
thou longest again for my fond loving care
for my kiss on thy cheek, for my hand on thy hair
but angels around thee their loving watch keep
and angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep
gird on thy armor, keep back thy tears
count not thy trials nor efforts in vain
they'll bring thee the light of thy childhood again
thou shouldst not weary, my child, by the way
but watch for the light of that brighter day
not tired of "sowing for others to reap
for angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep
tired, my child, of the "base, the untrue
i have tasted the cup they have given to you
i've felt the deep sorrow in the living green
of a low mossy grave by the silvery stream
but the dear mother i then sought for in vain
is an angel presence and with me again
and in the still night, from the silence deep
come the bright angels to rock me to sleep
nearer thee now than in days that are flown
purer the love-light encircling thy home
far more enduring the watch for tonight
than ever earth worship away from the light
soon the dark shadows will linger no more
nor come to thy call from the opening door
but know thou, my child, that the angels watch keep
and soon, very soon, they'll rock thee to sleep
they'll sing thee to sleep with a soothing song
and, waking, thou'lt be with a heavenly throng
and thy life, with its toil and its tears and pain
thou wilt then see has not been in vain
thou wilt meet those in bliss whom on earth thou didst love
and whom thou hast taught of the "mansions above
the angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep
perhaps the day you reck
our boys, the twenty-second maine
kept early's men in check
just where wade hampton boomed away
the fight went neck and neck
all day the weaker wing we held
and held it with a will
five several stubborn times we charged
the battery on the hill
and five times beaten back, re-formed
and kept our column still
at last from out the center fight
spurred up a general's aide
he cried, as past he sped
our colonel simply touched his cap
and then, with measured tread
to lead the crouching line once more
the grand old fellow came
no wounded man but raised his head
and strove to gasp his name
and those who could not speak nor stir
for he was all the world to us
that hero gray and grim
right well we knew that fearful slope
we'd climb with none but him
though while his white head led the way
we'd charge hell's portals in
this time we were not half way up
when, midst the storm of shell
our leader, with his sword upraised
beneath our bayonets fell
and as we bore him back, the foe
set up a joyous yell
our hearts went with him. back we swept
and when the bugle said
but hung his dogged head
the sullen soldiers said
just then before the laggard line
the colonel's horse we spied
bay billy, with his trappings on
his nostrils swelling wide
as though still on his gallant back
the master sat astride
right royally he took the place
that was of old his wont
and with a neigh that seemed to say
above the battle's brunt
if i am not in front
like statues rooted there we stood
and gazed a little space
above that floating mane we missed
the dear familiar face
but we saw bay billy's eye of fire
and it gave us heart of grace
no bugle-call could rouse us all
as that brave sight had done
down all the battered line we felt
a lightning impulse run
up, up the hill we followed bill
and we captured every gun
and when upon the conquered height
died out the battle's hum
vainly 'mid living and the dead
we sought our leader dumb
it seemed as if a spectre steed
to win that day had come
and then the dusk and dew of night
fell softly o'er the plain
as though o'er man's dread work of death
the angels wept again
and drew night's curtain gently round
a thousand beds of pain
all night the surgeons' torches went
the ghastly rows between
all night with solemn step i paced
the torn and bloody green
but who that fought in the big war
such dread sights have not seen
at last the morning broke. the lark
sang in the merry skies
as if to e'en the sleepers there
it said "awake, arise
though naught but that last trump of all
could ope their heavy eyes
and then once more, with banners gay
stretched out the long brigade
trimly upon the furrowed field
the troops stood on parade
and bravely 'mid the ranks were closed
the gaps the fight had made
not half the twenty-second's men
were in their place that morn
and corporal dick, who yester-noon
stood six brave fellows on
now touched my elbow in the ranks
for all between were gone
ah! who forgets that weary hour
when, as with misty eyes
to call the old familiar roll
the solemn sergeant tries
one feels that thumping of the heart
as no prompt voice replies
and as in faltering tone and slow
the last few names were said
across the field some missing horse
toiled up with weary tread
it caught the sergeant's eye, and quick
bay billy's name he read
yes! there the old bay hero stood
all safe from battle's harms
and ere an order could be heard
or the bugle's quick alarms
down all the front, from end to end
the troops presented arms
not all the shoulder-straps on earth
could still our mighty cheer
and ever from that famous day
when rang the roll-call clear
bay billy's name was read, and then
the whole line answered, "here
day by day the organ-builder in his lonely chamber wrought
day by day the soft air trembled to the music of his thought
till at last the work was ended; and no organ voice so grand
ever yet had soared responsive to the master's magic hand
ay, so rarely was it builded that whenever groom and bride
who, in god's sight were well-pleasing, in the church stood side by side
without touch or breath the organ of itself began to play
and the very airs of heaven through the soft gloom seemed to stray
he was young, the organ-builder, and o'er all the land his fame
ran with fleet and eager footsteps, like a swiftly rushing flame
all the maidens heard the story; all the maidens blushed and smiled
by his youth and wondrous beauty and his great renown beguiled
so he sought and won the fairest, and the wedding-day was set
happy day--the brightest jewel in the glad year's coronet
but when they the portal entered, he forgot his lovely bride
forgot his love, forgot his god, and his heart swelled high with pride
how the vast cathedral-arches will re-echo with my praise
up the aisle the gay procession moved. the altar shone afar
with every candle gleaming through soft shadows like a star
but he listened, listened, listened, with no thought of love or prayer
for the swelling notes of triumph from his organ standing there
all was silent. nothing heard he save the priest's low monotone
and the bride's robe trailing softly o'er the floor of fretted stone
then his lips grew white with anger. surely god was pleased with him
who had built the wondrous organ for his temple vast and dim
whose the fault then? hers--the maiden standing meekly at his side
flamed his jealous rage, maintaining she was false to him--his bride
vain were all her protestations, vain her innocence and truth
on that very night he left her to her anguish and her ruth
far he wandered to a country wherein no man knew his name
for ten weary years he dwelt there, nursing still his wrath and shame
then his haughty heart grew softer, and he thought by night and day
of the bride he had deserted, till he hardly dared to pray
thought of her, a spotless maiden, fair and beautiful and good
thought of his relentless anger, that had cursed her womanhood
till his yearning grief and penitence at last were all complete
and he longed, with bitter longing, just to fall down at her feet
ah! how throbbed his heart when, after many a weary day and night
rose his native towers before him, with the sunset glow alight
through the gates into the city on he pressed with eager tread
there he met a long procession--mourners following the dead
why do yonder sorrowing maidens scatter flowers along the way
and because her days were given to the service of god's poor
from his church we mean to bury her. see! yonder is the door
no one knew him; no one wondered when he cried out, white with pain
no one questioned when, with pallid lips, he poured his tears like rain
as he made his way unchallenged, and bore the coffin's head
bore it through the open portal, bore it up the echoing aisle
let it down before the altar, where the lights burned clear the while
when, oh, hark; the wondrous organ of itself began to play
strains of rare, unearthly sweetness never heard until that day
all the vaulted arches rang with music sweet and clear
all the air was filled with glory, as of angels hovering near
and ere yet the strain was ended, he who bore the coffin's head
with the smile of one forgiven, gently sank beside it--dead
they who raised the body knew him, and they laid him by his bride
down the aisle and o'er the threshold they were carried, side by side
while the organ played a dirge that no man ever heard before
and then softly sank to silence--silence kept forevermore
a fellow just a thing or two
you've had a furlough, been to see
how all the folks in jersey do
it's months ago since i was there
i, and a bullet from fair oaks
when you were home, old comrade, say
did you see any of our folks
for if i do look grim and rough
i've got some feelin
people think
a soldier's heart is mighty tough
but, harry, when the bullets fly
and hot saltpetre flames and smokes
while whole battalions lie afield
one's apt to think about his folks
the old man--is he hearty yet
and mother--does she fade at all
or does she seem to pine and fret
for me? and sis?--has she grown tall
and did you see her friend--you know
that annie moss
where did you see her?--tell: me, hal
a lot of news about our folks
it's likely, for they're always there
not sunday? no? a funeral? who
who, harry? how you shake and stare
all well, you say, and all were out
what ails you, hal? is this a hoax
why don't you tell me like a man
what is the matter with our folks
i say all well, for he knows best
who takes the young ones in his arms
before the sun goes to the west
the axe-man death deals right and left
and flowers fall as well as oaks
and so
fair annie blooms no more
and that's the matter with your folks
and this white blossom from her breast
and here--your sister bessie wrote
a letter telling all the rest
bear up, old friend
nobody speaks
only the old camp-raven croaks
and soldiers whisper, "boys, be still
there's some bad news from granger's folks
he turns his back--the only foe
that ever saw it--on this grief
and, as men will, keeps down the tears
kind nature sends to woe's relief
then answers he: "ah, hal, i'll try
but in my throat there's something chokes
because, you see, i've thought so long
to count her in among our folks
but still i will keep thinking, too
i could have kept all trouble off
by being tender, kind and true
but maybe not
she's safe up there
and when the hand deals other strokes
she'll stand by heaven's gate, i know
and wait to welcome in our folks
which well-nigh filled joe's bar-room on the corner of the square
and as songs and witty stories came through the open door
a vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor
i wouldn't touch him with a fork, he's as filthy as a turk
this badinage the poor wretch took with stoical, good grace
in fact, he smiled as though he thought he'd struck the proper place
to be in such good company would make a deacon proud
when i had cash to treat the gang, this hand was never slow
what? you laugh as though you thought this pocket never held a sou
i once was fixed as well, my boys, as any one of you
next time i pass this good saloon, i'll make another call
my voice is cracked, my throat's worn out, and my lungs are going fast
i'll tell you a funny story, and a fact, i promise, too
that i was ever a decent man, not one of you would think
but i was, some four or five years back. say, give me another drink
such little drinks, to a bum like me, are miserably tame
five fingers--there, that's the scheme--and corking whisky, too
well, here's luck, boys; and landlord, my best regards to you
i came to be the dirty sot you see before you now
as i told you, once i was a man, with muscle, frame and health
and but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth
but an artist, and, for my age, was rated pretty good
i worked hard at my canvas, and was bidding fair to rise
for gradually i saw the star of fame before my eyes
it brought me fifteen hundred pounds, and added to my name
and then i met a woman--now comes the funny part
with eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart
could ever love a woman, and expect her love for me
but 'twas so, and for a month or two her smiles were freely given
and when her loving lips touched mine it carried me to heaven
with a form like the milo venus, too beautiful to live
with eyes that would beat the koh-i-noor, and a wealth of chestnut hair
if so, 'twas she, for there never was another half so fair
of a fair-haired boy, a friend of mine, who lived across the way
and madeline admired it, and, much to my surprise
said that she'd like to know the man that had such dreamy eyes
my friend had stolen my darling, and i was left alone
and ere a year of misery had passed above my head
the jewel i had treasured so had tarnished, and was dead
i thought you'd be amused, and laughing all the while
why, what's the mattter, friend? there's a teardrop in your eye
come, laugh, like me; 'tis only babes and women that should cry
and i'll draw right here a picture of the face that drove me mad
give me that piece of chalk with which you mark the baseball score
you shall see the lovely madeline upon the bar-room floor
another drink, and, with chalk in hand, the vagabond began
to sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man
then as he placed another lock upon the shapely head
with a fearful shriek, he leaped, and fell across the picture dead
one day through the primeval wood
a calf walked home, as good calves should
but made a trail all bent askew
a crooked trail, as all calves do
since then three hundred years have fled
and, i infer, the calf is dead
but still he left behind his trail
and thereby hangs a moral tale
the trail was taken up next day
by a lone dog that passed that way
and then the wise bell-wether sheep
pursued the trail o'er vale and steep
and drew the flock behind him, too
as good bell-wethers always do
and from that day, o'er hill and glade
through those old woods a path was made
and many men wound in and out
and turned and dodged and bent about
and uttered words of righteous wrath
because 'twas such a crooked path
but still they followed--do not laugh
the first migrations of that calf
and through this winding woodway stalked
because he wabbled when he walked
this forest path became a lane
that bent and turned and turned again
this crooked path became a road
where many a poor horse, with his load
toiled on beneath the burning sun
and traveled some three miles in one
and thus a century and a half
they trod the footsteps of that calf
the years passed on in swiftness fleet
the road became a village street
and this, before men were aware
a city's crowded thoroughfare
and soon the central street was this
of a renowned metropolis
and men two centuries and a half
trod in the footsteps of that calf
each day a hundred thousand rout
followed the zigzag calf about
and o'er his crooked journey went
the traffic of a continent
a hundred thousand men were led
by a calf near three centuries dead
they followed still his crooked way
and lost one hundred years a day
for thus such reverence is lent
to well-established precedent
a moral lesson this might teach
were i ordained and called to preach
for men are prone to go it blind
along the calf-paths of the mind
and work away from sun to sun
to do what other men have done
they follow in the beaten track
and out and in, and forth and back
and still their devious course pursue
to keep the path that others do
but how the wise wood-gods must laugh
who saw the first primeval calf
ah, many things this tale might teach
but i am not ordained to preach
paul revere was a rider bold
well has his valorous deed been told
sheridan's ride was a glorious one
often it has been dwelt upon
but why should men do all the deeds
on which the love of a patriot feeds
hearken to me, while i reveal
the dashing ride of jennie m'neal
on a spot as pretty as might be found
in the dangerous length of the neutral ground
in a cottage, cozy, and all their own
she and her mother lived alone
safe were the two, with their frugal store
from all of the many who passed their door
for jennie's mother was strange to fears
and jennie was large for fifteen years
with vim her eyes were glistening
her hair was the hue of a blackbird's wing
and while the friends who knew her well
the sweetness of her heart could tell
a gun that hung on the kitchen wall
looked solemnly quick to heed her call
and they who were evil-minded knew
her nerve was strong and her aim was true
so all kind words and acts did deal
to generous, black-eyed jennie m'neal
one night, when the sun had crept to bed
and rain-clouds lingered overhead
and sent their surly drops for proof
to drum a tune on the cottage roof
close after a knock at the outer door
there entered a dozen dragoons or more
their red coats, stained by the muddy road
that they were british soldiers showed
the captain his hostess bent to greet
saying, "madam, please give us a bit to eat
we will pay you well, and, if may be
this bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea
then we must dash ten miles ahead
to catch a rebel colonel abed
he is visiting home, as doth appear
we will make his pleasure cost him dear
and they fell on the hasty supper with zeal
close-watched the while by jennie m'neal
for the gray-haired colonel they hovered near
had been her true friend, kind and dear
and oft, in her younger days, had he
right proudly perched her upon his knee
and told her stories many a one
concerning the french war lately done
and oft together the two friends were
and many the arts he had taught to her
she had hunted by his fatherly side
he had shown her how to fence and ride
and once had said, "the time may be
your skill and courage may stand by me
so sorrow for him she could but feel
brave, grateful-hearted jennie m'neal
with never a thought or a moment more
bare-headed she slipped from the cottage door
ran out where the horses were left to feed
unhitched and mounted the captain's steed
and down the hilly and rock-strewn way
she urged the fiery horse of gray
around her slender and cloakless form
pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm
secure and tight a gloveless hand
grasped the reins with stern command
and full and black her long hair streamed
whenever the ragged lightning gleamed
and on she rushed for the colonel's weal
brave, lioness-hearted jennie m'neal
hark! from the hills, a moment mute
came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit
and a cry from the foremost trooper said
she heeded it not, and not in vain
she lashed the horse with the bridle-rein
so into the night the gray horse strode
his shoes hewed fire from the rocky road
and the high-born courage that never dies
flashed from his rider's coal-black eyes
the pebbles flew from the fearful race
the raindrops grasped at her glowing face
cried eager, resolute jennie m'neal
then, no one answering to the calls
sped after her a volley of balls
they passed her in her rapid flight
they screamed to her left, they screamed to her right
but, rushing still o'er the slippery track
she sent no token of answer back
except a silvery laughter-peal
brave, merry-hearted jennie m'neal
so on she rushed, at her own good will
through wood and valley, o'er plain and hill
the gray horse did his duty well
till all at once he stumbled and fell
himself escaping the nets of harm
but flinging the girl with a broken arm
still undismayed by the numbing pain
she clung to the horse's bridle-rein
and gently bidding him to stand
petted him with her able hand
then sprung again to the saddle bow
and shouted, "one more trial now
as if ashamed of the heedless fall
he gathered his strength once more for all
and, galloping down a hillside steep
gained on the troopers at every leap
no more the high-bred steed did reel
but ran his best for jennie m'neal
they were a furlong behind, or more
when the girl burst through the colonel's door
her poor arm helpless hanging with pain
and she all drabbled and drenched with rain
but her cheeks as red as fire-brands are
and her eyes as bright as a blazing star
and shouted, "quick! be quick, i say
they come! they come! away! away
then, sunk on the rude white floor of deal
poor, brave, exhausted jennie m'neal
the startled colonel sprung, and pressed
the wife and children to his breast
and turned away from his fireside bright
and glided into the stormy night
then soon and safely made his way
to where the patriot army lay
but first he bent in the dim firelight
and kissed the forehead broad and white
and blessed the girl who had ridden so well
to keep him out of a prison-cell
the girl roused up at the martial din
just as the troopers came rushing in
and laughed, e'en in the midst of a moan
saying, "good sirs, your bird has flown
so deal with me now as you think best
but the grand young captain bowed, and said
of womankind i must crown you queen
so brave a girl i have never seen
wear this gold ring as your valor's due
and when peace comes i will come for you
but jennie's face an arch smile wore
as she said, "there's a lad in putnam's corps
who told me the same, long time ago
you two would never agree, i know
i promised my love to be as true as steel
said good, sure-hearted jennie m'neal
they say that man is mighty, he governs land and sea
he wields a mighty scepter o'er lesser powers that be
by a mightier power and stronger, man from his throne is hurled
and the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
blessings on the hand of woman! angels guard its strength and grace
in the palace, cottage, hovel, oh, no matter where the place
would that never storms assailed it, rainbows ever gently curled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
infancy's the tender fountain, power may with beauty flow
mother's first to guide the streamlets, from them souls unresting grow
grow on for the good or evil, sunshine streamed or darkness hurled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
woman, how divine your mission here upon our natal sod
keep, oh, keep the young heart open always to the breath of god
all true trophies of the ages are from mother-love impearled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
blessings on the hand of woman! fathers, sons and daughters cry
and the sacred song is mingled with the worship in the sky
mingles where no tempest darkens, rainbows evermore are curled
for the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
i live for those who love me
whose hearts are kind and true
for the heaven that smiles above me
and awaits my spirit, too
for the human ties that bind me
for the task by god assigned me
for the bright hopes left behind me
and the good that i can do
i live to learn their story
who've suffered for my sake
to emulate their glory
and to follow in their wake
bards, patriots, martyrs, sages
the noble of all ages
whose deeds crowd history's pages
and time's great volume make
i live to hold communion
with all that is divine
to feel there is a union
to profit by affliction
reap truths from fields of fiction
grow wiser from conviction
and fulfill each grand design
i live to hail that season
by gifted minds foretold
when men shall rule by reason
and not alone by gold
when man to man united
and every wrong thing righted
the whole world shall be lighted
as eden was of old
i live for those who love me
for those who know me true
for the heaven that smiles above me
and awaits my spirit, too
for the cause that lacks assistance
for the wrong that needs resistance
for the future in the distance
and the good that i can do
if all the ships i have at sea
should come a-sailing home to me
weighed down with gems, and silk and gold
ah! well, the harbor would not hold
so many ships as there would be
if all my ships came home from sea
if half my ships came home from sea
and brought their precious freight to me
ah! well, i should have wealth as great
as any king that sits in state
so rich the treasure there would be
in half my ships now out at sea
if but one ship i have at sea
should come a-sailing home to me
ah! well, the storm clouds then might frown
for, if the others all went down
still rich and glad and proud i'd be
if that one ship came home to me
if that one ship went down at sea
and all the others came to me
weighed down with gems and wealth untold
with honor, riches, glory, gold
the poorest soul on earth i'd be
if that one ship came not to me
o skies, be calm; o winds, blow free
blow all my ships safe home to me
but if thou sendest some awrack
to nevermore come sailing back
send any, all that skim the sea
but send my love ship home to me
god made man in his own image; in the image of god made he
bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
upon his hoe and gazes on the ground
the emptiness of ages in his face
and on his back the burden of the world
who made him dead to rapture and despair
a thing that grieves not and that never hopes
stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox
who loosened and let down this brutal jaw
whose was the hand that slanted back this brow
whose breath blew out the light within this brain
is this the thing, the lord god made and gave
to have dominion over sea and land
to trace the stars and search the heavens for power
to feel the passion of eternity
is this the dream he dreamed who shaped the suns
and pillared the blue firmament with light
down all the stretch of hell to its last gulf
there is no shape more terrible than this
more tongued with censure of the world's blind greed
more filled with signs and portents for the soul
more fraught with menace to the universe
what gulfs between him and the seraphim
slave of the wheel of labor, what to him
are plato and the swing of pleiades
what the long reaches of the peaks of song
the rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose
through this dread shape the suffering ages look
time's tragedy is in that aching stoop
through this dread shape humanity betrayed
plundered, profaned and disinherited
cries protest to the judges of the world
a protest that is also prophecy
o masters, lords and rulers in all lands
is this the handiwork you give to god
this monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched
how will you ever straighten up this shape
touch it again with immortality
give back the upward looking and the light
rebuild it in the music and the dream
make right the immemorial infamies, perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes
o masters, lords and rulers in all lands
how will the future reckon with this man
how answer his brute question in that hour
when whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world
how will it be with kingdom and with kings
with those who shaped him to the thing he is
when this dumb terror shall reply to god
after the silence of the centuries
did you say you wished to see me, sir? step in; 'tis a cheerless place
but you're heartily welcome all the same; to be poor is no disgrace
have i been here long? oh, yes, sir! 'tis thirty winters gone
since poor jim took to crooked ways and left me all alone
jim was my son, and a likelier lad you'd never wish to see
till evil counsels won his heart and led him away from me
and men go down--and down--and down--to blackness and despair
tossing about like wrecks at sea, with helm and anchor lost
on and on, through the surging waves, nor caring to count the cost
i doubt sometimes if the savior sees, he seems so far away
how the souls he loved and died for, are drifting--drifting astray
indeed,'tis little wonder, sir, if woman shrinks and cries
when the life-blood on rum's altar spilled is calling to the skies
small wonder if her own heart feels each sacrificial blow
for isn't each life a part of hers? each pain her hurt and woe
read all the records of crime and shame--'tis bitterly, sadly true
where manliness and honor die, there some woman's heart dies, too
i often think, when i hear folks talk so prettily and so fine
of "alcohol as needful food"; of the "moderate use of wine
how "the world couldn't do without it, there was clearly no other way
but for a man to drink, or let it alone, as his own strong will might say
that "to use it, but not abuse it, was the proper thing to do
how i wish they'd let old poorhouse nan preach her little sermon, too
i would give them scenes in a woman's life that would make their
pulses stir
for i was a drunkard's child and wife--aye, a drunkard's mother, sir
i would tell of childish terrors, of childish tears and pain
of cruel blows from a father's hand when rum had crazed his brain
he always said he could drink his fill, or let it alone as well
perhaps he might, he was killed one night in a brawl--in a grog-shop hell
i would tell of years of loveless toil the drunkard's child had passed
with just one gleam of sunshine, too beautiful to last
when i married tom i thought for sure i had nothing more to fear
that life would come all right at last; the world seemed full of cheer
but he took to moderate drinking--he allowed 'twas a harmless thing
so the arrow sped, and my bird of hope came down with a broken wing
tom was only a moderate drinker; ah, sir, do you bear in mind
how the plodding tortoise in the race left the leaping hare behind
and that's the way, i'm thinking, that the moderate drinkers go
step over step--day after day--with sleepless, tireless pace
while the toper sometimes looks behind and tarries in the race
ah, heavily in the well-worn path poor tom walked day by day
for my heart-strings clung about his feet and tangled up the way
the days were dark, and friends were gone, and life dragged on full slow
and children came, like reapers, and to a harvest of want and woe
two of them died, and i was glad when they lay before me dead
i had grown so weary of their cries--their pitiful cries for bread
there came a time when my heart was stone; i could neither hope nor pray
poor tom lay out in the potter's field, and my boy had gone astray
my boy who'd been my idol, while, like hound athirst for blood
between my breaking heart and him the liquor seller stood
and lured him on with pleasant words, his pleasures and his wine
ah, god have pity on other hearts as bruised and hurt as mine
there were whispers of evil-doing, of dishonor, and of shame
that i cannot bear to think of now, and would not dare to name
there was hiding away from the light of day, there was creeping about at
night
a hurried word of parting--then a criminal's stealthy flight
his lips were white with remorse and fright when he gave me a good-by kiss
and i've never seen my poor lost boy from that black day to this
ah, none but a mother can tell you, sir, how a mother's heart will ache
with the sorrow that comes of a sinning child, with grief for a lost one's
when she knows the feet she trained to walk have gone so far astray
and the lips grown bold with curses that she taught to sing and pray
a child may fear--a wife may weep, but of all sad things, none other
seems half so sorrowful to me as being a drunkard's mother
they tell me that down in the vilest dens of the city's crime and murk
there are men with the hearts of angels, doing the angels' work
that they win back the lost and the straying, that they help the weak to
stand
by the wonderful power of loving words--and the help of god's right hand
and often and often, the dear lord knows, i've knelt and prayed to him
that somewhere, somehow, 'twould happen that they'd find and save my jim
you'll say 'tis a poor old woman's whim; but when i prayed last night
right over yon eastern window there shone a wonderful light
the softest voice i had ever heard: it rung like a silver bell
and these were the words, "the prodigal turns, so tired by want and sin
he seeks his father's open door--he weeps--and enters in
why, sir, you're crying as hard as i; what--is it really done
have the loving voice and the helping hand brought back my wandering son
did you kiss me and call me "mother"--and hold me to your breast
or is it one of the taunting dreams that come to mock my rest
no--no! thank god, 'tis a dream come true! i can die, for he's saved
my boy
and the poor old heart that had lived on grief was broken at last by joy
oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud
like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud
a flash of the lightning, a break of the wave
he passes from life to his rest in the grave
the leaves of the oak and the willows shall fade
be scattered around, and together be laid
and the young and the old, and the low and the high
shall moulder to dust, and together shall die
the child whom a mother attended and loved
the mother that infant's affection who proved
the husband that mother and infant who blessed
each--all are away to their dwelling of rest
the maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye
shone beauty and pleasure--her triumphs are by
and the memory of those who loved her and praised
are alike from the minds of the living erased
the hand of the king who the scepter hath borne
the brow of the priest who the mitre hath worn
the eye of the sage and the heart of the brave
are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave
the peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap
the herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep
the beggar who wandered in search of his bread
have faded away like the grass that we tread
the saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven
the sinner who dared to remain unforgiven
the wise and the foolish, the guilty and just
have quietly mingled their bones in the dust
so the multitude goes--like the flower and the weed
that wither away to let others succeed
so the multitude comes--even those we behold
to repeat every tale that has often been told
for we are the same things that our fathers have been
we see the same sights that our fathers have seen
we drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun
and we run the same course that our fathers have run
the thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think
from the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink
to the life we are clinging to, they too would cling
but it speeds from the earth like a bird on the wing
they loved--but their story we cannot enfold
they scorned--but the heart of the haughty is cold
they grieved--but no wail from their slumbers may come
they joy'd--but the voice of their gladness--is dumb
they died, ay, they died! and we things that are now
who walk on the turf that lies over their brow
who make in their dwellings a transient abode
meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road
yea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain
are mingled together in sunshine and rain
and the smile, and the tear, and the song and the dirge
still follow each other like surge upon surge
from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death
from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud
oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud
that blazed before fort sumter had wakened the north as one
long ere the wondrous pillar of battle-cloud and fire
had marked where the unchained millions marched on to their heart's desire
on roofs and glittering turrets, that night, as the sun went down
the mellow glow of the twilight shone like a jeweled crown
and, bathed in the living glory, as the people lifted their eyes
they saw the pride of the city, the spire of st. michael's rise
high over the lesser steeples, tipped with a golden ball
that hung like a radiant planet caught in its earthward fall
first glimpse of home to the sailor who made the harbor round
and last slow-fading vision dear to the outward bound
the gently gathering shadows shut out the waning light
the children prayed at their bedsides as they were wont each night
the noise of buyer and seller from the busy mart was gone
and in dreams of a peaceful morrow the city slumbered on
but another light than sunrise aroused the sleeping street
for a cry was heard at midnight, and the rush of trampling feet
men stared in each other's faces, thro' mingled fire and smoke
while the frantic bells went clashing clamorous, stroke on stroke
by the glare of her blazing roof-tree the houseless mother fled
with the babe she pressed to her bosom shrieking in nameless dread
while the fire-king's wild battalions scaled wall and cap-stone high
and painted their glaring banners against an inky sky
from the death that raged behind them, and the crush of ruin loud
to the great square of the city, were driven the surging crowd
where yet firm in all the tumult, unscathed by the fiery flood
with its heavenward pointing finger the church of st. michael's stood
but e'en as they gazed upon it there rose a sudden wail
a cry of horror blended with the roaring of the gale
on whose scorching wings updriven, a single flaming brand
aloft on the towering steeple clung like a bloody hand
far out on the lurid harbor they watched it from the ships
a baleful gleam, that brighter and ever brighter shone
like a flickering, trembling will-o'-the-wisp to a steady beacon grown
for the love of the periled city, plucks down yon burning brand
so cried the mayor of charleston, that all the people heard
but they looked each one at his fellow, and no man spoke a word
who is it leans from the belfry, with face upturned to the sky
clings to a column and measures the dizzy spire with his eye
will he dare it, the hero undaunted, that terrible, sickening height
or will the hot blood of his courage freeze in his veins at the sight
but see! he has stepped on the railing, he climbs with his feet and his
hands
and firm on a narrow projection, with the belfry beneath him, he stands
now once, and once only, they cheer him--a single tempestuous breath
and there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness of death
slow, steadily mounting, unheeding aught save the goal of the fire
still higher and higher, an atom, he moves on the face of the spire
he stops! will he fall? lo! for answer, a gleam like a meteor's track
and, hurled on the stones of the pavement, the red brand lies shattered and
black
once more the shouts of the people have rent the quivering air
at the church door mayor and council wait with their feet on the stair
and the eager throng behind them press for a touch of his hand
the unknown savior whose daring could compass a deed so grand
but why does a sudden tremor seize on them as they gaze
and what meaneth that stifled murmur of wonder and amaze
he stood in the gate of the temple he had periled his life to save
and the face of the unknown hero was the sable face of a slave
with folded arms he was speaking in tones that were clear, not loud
and his eyes, ablaze in their sockets, burnt into the eyes of the crowd
if the deed i have done before you be not the deed of a _man
he stepped but a short space backward, and from all the women and men
there were only sobs for answer, and the mayor called for a pen
and the great seal of the city, that he might read who ran
and the slave who saved st. michael's went out from its door a man
a soldier of the legion lay dying in algiers
there was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears
but a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood ebbed away
and bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say
the dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade's hand
and he said, "i never more shall see my own, my native land
take a message, and a token, to some distant friends of mine
for i was born at bingen--at bingen on the rhine
to hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground
that we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done
full many a corpse lay ghastly pale, beneath the setting sun
and 'midst the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars
the death-wound on their gallant breasts the last of many scars
but some were young--and suddenly beheld life's morn decline
and one had come from bingen--fair bingen on the rhine
and i was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage
for my father was a soldier, and even as a child
my heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild
and when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard
i let them take whate'er they would, but kept my father's sword
and with boyish love i hung it where the bright light used to shine
on the cottage-wall at bingen--calm bingen on the rhine
when the troops are marching home again with glad and gallant tread
but to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye
for her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die
and if a comrade seek her love, i ask her in my name
to listen to him kindly, without regret or shame
and to hang the old sword in its place (my father's sword and mine
for the honor of old bingen--dear bingen on the rhine
you'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye
too innocent for coquetry--too fond for idle scorning
oh, friend! i fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning
tell her the last night of my life (for ere the moon be risen
my body will be out of pain--my soul be out of prison
i dreamed i stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine
on the vine-clad hills of bingen--fair bingen on the rhine
the german songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear
and down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill
the echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still
and her glad blue eyes were on me as we passed with friendly talk
down many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk
and her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine
but we'll meet no more at bingen--loved bingen on the rhine
his voice grew faint and hoarser,--his grasp was childish weak
his eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak
his comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled
the soldier of the legion, in a foreign land--was dead
and the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down
on the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corpses strown
yea, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine
as it shone on distant bingen--fair bingen on the rhine
on a board of bright mosaic wrought in many a quaint design
gleam a brace of silver goblets wreathed with flowers and filled with wine
round the board a group is seated; here and there are threads of white
which their dark locks lately welcomed; but they're only boys tonight
some whose words have thrilled the senate, some who win the critic's
praise
all are "chums" to-night, with voices redolent of college days
how we used to fill our oil cans and repair to 'no. 9
but at last the old professor--never long was he outdone
opened up our shining oil cans and demolished all our fun
in the laugh that rings so gayly through the richly curtained room
join they all, save one; why is it? does he see the waxen bloom
tremble in its vase of silver? does he see the ruddy wine
shiver in its crystal goblet, or do those grave eyes divine
something sadder yet? he pauses till their mirth has died away
then in measured tones speaks gravely
worthily your praise
it is bitter fruitage ripened from our pranks of college days
with his flexible voice would garnish any tale, whate'er it be
at the san francisco l---- house, when i heard a plaintive moan
sounding from the room adjoining. hoping to give some relief
to the suffering one, i entered; but it thrilled my heart with grief
just to see that wreck of manhood--bloated face, disheveled hair
wildly tossing, ever moaning, while his thin hands beat the air
broken prayers, vile oaths and curses filled the air as i drew near
then in faint and piteous accents, these words i could plainly hear
then i'll follow where they lead me, be it to the depths of hell
when he saw me he grew calmer, started strangely--looked me o'er
oh, the glory of expression! i had seen those eyes before
yes, i knew him; it was horace, he who won the college prize
naught remained of his proud beauty but the splendor of his eyes
he whom we were all so proud of, lay there in the fading light
if my years should number fourscore, i shall ne'er forget that sight
and he knew me--called me 'albert,' ere a single word i'd said
we were comrades in the old days; i sat down beside the bed
he kept talking of our boyhood while my hand he still would keep
in his own so white and wasted, and with burning eyes would gaze
on my face, still talking feebly of the dear old college days
but a poor degraded outcast--hopes, ambition swept away
and it dates back to those oil cans that we filled in greatest glee
little did i think in those days what the harvest now would be
wrings my heart, burst from his white lips, though his teeth were tightly
and with sudden strength he started--sprang from my detaining arm
shrieking wildly, 'curse the demons; do they think to do me harm
back! i say, ye forked-tongued serpents reeking with the filth of hell
don't ye see i have her with me--my poor sainted little belle
my head down, 'oh, al,' he whispered, 'such remorse you never knew
and again i tried to soothe him, but my eyes o'erbrimmed with tears
his were dry and clear, as brilliant as they were in college years
all the flush had left his features, he lay white as marble now
tenderly i smoothed his pillow, wiped the moisture from his brow
though i begged him to be quiet, he would talk of those old days
brokenly at times, but always of 'the boys' with loving praise
you remember rena barstow. when i asked if she were dead
but i wish, to god, it were so, and i still might call her mine
she's divorced--she's mine no longer,' here his voice grew weak and hoarse
i've a little girl in heaven, playing round the savior's knee
always patient and so faithful that at last she died for me
every one had lost hope in me but my faithful little child
she would say, "now stop, dear papa, for i know you can stop _now
i would promise, kiss my darling, and the next day break my vow
so it went until one christmas, dark and stormy, cold and drear
out i started, just as usual, for the cursed rum shop near
and my darling followed after, in the storm of rain and sleet
with no covering wrapped about her, naught but slippers on her feet
no one knew it, no one missed her, till there came with solemn tread
stern-faced men unto our dwelling, bringing back our darling--_dead
they had found her cold and lifeless, like, they said, an angel fair
leaning 'gainst the grog shop window--oh, she thought that _i was there
then he raised his arms toward heaven, called aloud unto the dead
for his mind again was wandering: 'belle, my precious belle!' he said
all the way--alone--my darling--just to lead--poor--papa--home
and he surely had an answer, for a silence o'er him fell
and i sat alone and lonely--death had come with little belle
silence in that princely parlor--head of every guest is bowed
they still see the red wine sparkle, but 'tis through a misty cloud
said the host at last, arising, "i have scorned the pledge to sign
laughed at temperance all my life long. never more shall drop of wine
touch my lips. the fruit _was_ bitter, boys; 'twas i proposed it first
that foul joke from which poor horace ever bore a life accurst
let us pledge ourselves to-night, boys, never more by word, or deed
in our own fair homes, or elsewhere, help to plant the poison seed
silence once again, but only for a moment's space, and then
in one voice they all responded with a low and firm "amen
the summer and autumn had been so wet
that in winter the corn was growing yet
the grain lie rotting on the ground
every day the starving poor
crowded round bishop hatto's door
for he had a plentiful last year's store
and all the neighborhood could tell
his granaries were furnish'd well
at last bishop hatto appointed a day
to quiet the poor without delay
he bade them to his great barn repair
and they should have food for the winter there
rejoiced the tidings good to hear
the poor folk flock'd from far and near
the great barn was full as it could hold
of women and children, and young and old
then, when he saw it could hold no more
bishop hatto he made fast the door
and while for mercy on christ they call
he set fire to the barn and burnt them all
for ridding it, in these times forlorn
of rats that only consume the corn
so then to his palace returned he
and he sat down to supper merrily
and he slept that night like an innocent man
but bishop hatto never slept again
in the morning, as he enter'd the hall
where his picture hung against the wall
a sweat like death all over him came
for the rats had eaten it out of the frame
as he look'd, there came a man from his farm
he had a countenance white with alarm
and the rats had eaten all your corn
another came running presently
and he was pale as pale could be
the lord forgive you for yesterday
the walls are high, and the shores are steep
and the stream is strong, and the water deep
bishop hatto fearfully hasten'd away
and he cross'd the rhine without delay
and reach'd his tower and barr'd with care
all the windows, doors, and loopholes there
he laid him down and closed his eyes
but soon a scream made him arise
he started, and saw two eyes of flame
on his pillow, from whence the screaming came
he listen'd and look'd,--it was only the cat
but the bishop he grew more fearful for that
for she sat screaming, mad with fear
at the army of rats that were drawing near
for they have swum over the river so deep
and they have climb'd the shores so steep
and up the tower their way is bent
to do the work for which they were sent
they are not to be told by the dozen or score
by thousands they come, and by myriads and more
such numbers had never been heard of before
such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore
down on his knees the bishop fell
and faster and faster his beads did he tell
as louder and louder, drawing near
the gnawing of their teeth he could hear
and in at the windows and in at the door
and through the walls helter-skelter they pour
and down from the ceiling and up through the floor
from the right and the left, from behind and before
from within and without, from above and below
and all at once to the bishop they go
they have whetted their teeth against the stones
and now they pick the bishop's bones
they gnaw'd the flesh from every limb
for they were sent to do judgment on him
the sabbath day was ending in a village by the sea
the uttered benediction touched the people tenderly
and they rose to face the sunset in the glowing, lighted west
and then hastened to their dwellings for god's blessed boon of rest
bat they looked across the waters, and a storm was raging there
a fierce spirit moved above them--the wild spirit of the air
and it lashed and shook and tore them till they thundered, groaned and
boomed
and, alas! for any vessel in their yawning gulfs entombed
very anxious were the people on that rocky coast of wales
lest the dawn of coming morrow should be telling awful tales
when the sea had spent its passion and should cast upon the shore
bits of wreck and swollen victims as it had done heretofore
with the rough winds blowing round her, a brave woman strained her eyes
as she saw along the billows a large vessel fall and rise
oh, it did not need a prophet to tell what the end must be
for no ship could ride in safety near that shore on such a sea
then the pitying people hurried from their homes and thronged the beach
oh, for power to cross the waters and the perishing to reach
helpless hands were wrung in terror, tender hearts grew cold with dread
and the ship, urged by the tempest, to the fatal rock-shore sped
lo! when next the white, shocked faces looked with terror on the sea
only one last clinging figure on a spar was seen to be
nearer to the trembling watchers came the wreck tossed by the wave
and the man still clung and floated, though no power on earth could save
any memory of his sermon? firstly? secondly? ah, no
there was but one thing to utter in that awful hour of woe
so he shouted through the trumpet, "look to jesus
can you hear?" and "aye, aye, sir," rang the answer o'er the waters loud
and clear
then they listened,--"he is singing, 'jesus, lover of my soul
and the winds brought back the echo, "while the nearer waters roll
strange, indeed, it was to hear him,--"till the storm of life is past
singing bravely o'er the waters, "oh, receive my soul at last
he could have no other refuge,--"hangs my helpless soul on thee
and the watchers, looking homeward, through their eyes by tears made dim
said, "he passed to be with jesus in the singing of that hymn
though to walk near its crest was so pleasant
but over its terrible edge there had slipped
a duke and full many a peasant
so the people said something would have to be done
but their projects did not at all tally
some said, "put a fence around the edge of the cliff
some, "an ambulance down in the valley
but the cry for the ambulance carried the day
for it spread through the neighboring city
a fence may be useful or not, it is true
but each heart became brimful of pity
for those who slipped over that dangerous cliff
and the dwellers in highway and alley
gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence
but an ambulance down in the valley
it isn't the slipping that hurts them so much
as the shock down below when they're stopping
so day after day, as these mishaps occurred
quick forth would these rescuers sally
to pick up the victims who fell off the cliff
with their ambulance down in the valley
then an old sage remarked: "it's a marvel to me
that people give far more attention
to repairing results than to stopping the cause
when they'd much better aim at prevention
let us stop at its source all this mischief," cried he
if the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense
with the ambulance down in the valley
he'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could
no! no! we'll support them forever
aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall
and shall this man dictate to us? shall he
why should people of sense stop to put up a fence
while the ambulance works in the valley
but a sensible few, who are practical too
will not bear with such nonsense much longer
they believe that prevention is better than cure
and their party will soon be the stronger
encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen
and while other philanthropists dally
they will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence
on the cliff that hangs over the valley
better guide well the young than reclaim them when old
for the voice of true wisdom is calling
to prevent other people from falling
better close up the source of temptation and crime
than deliver from dungeon or galley
better put a strong fence 'round the top of the cliff
than an ambulance down in the valley
a district school, not far away
was humming with its wonted noise
of three-score mingled girls and boys
some few upon their tasks intent
but more on furtive mischief bent
the while the master's downward look
was fastened on a copy-book
when suddenly, behind his back
rose sharp and clear a rousing smack
as 'twere a battery of bliss
let off in one tremendous kiss
i thaw him kith thuthanna peathe
with frown to make a statue thrill
the master thundered, "hither, will
like wretch o'ertaken in his track
with stolen chattels on his back
will hung his head in fear and shame
and to the awful presence came
a great, green, bashful simpleton
the butt of all good-natured fun
with smile suppressed, and birch upraised
the threatener faltered, "i'm amazed
that you, my biggest pupil, should
be guilty of an act so rude
before the whole set school to boot
what evil genius put you to 't
but when susanna shook her curls
and whispered i was 'fraid of girls
and dursn't kiss a baby's doll
i couldn't stand it, sir, at all
but up and kissed her on the spot
i know--boo-hoo--i ought to not
but, somehow, from her looks--boo-hoo
i thought she kind o' wished me to
do you know you have asked for the costliest thing
ever made by the hand above
a woman's heart and a woman's life
and a woman's wonderful love
do you know you have asked for this priceless thing
as a child might ask for a toy
demanding what others have died to win
with the reckless dash of a boy
you have written my lesson of duty out
man-like you have questioned me
now stand at the bar of my woman's soul
until i shall question thee
you require your mutton shall always be hot
your socks and your shirts shall be whole
i require your heart to be true as god's stars
and pure as heaven your soul
you require a cook for your mutton and beef
i require a far better thing
a seamstress you're wanting for stockings and shirts
i look for a man and a king
a king for a beautiful realm called home
and a man that the maker, god
shall look upon as he did the first
and say, "it is very good
i am fair and young, but the rose will fade
from my soft, young cheek one day
will you love then, 'mid the falling leaves
as you did 'mid the bloom of may
is your heart an ocean so strong and deep
i may launch my all on its tide
a loving woman finds heaven or hell
on the day she is made a bride
i require all things that are grand and true
all things that a man should be
if you give this all, i would stake my life
to be all you demand of me
if you cannot do this, a laundress and cook
you can hire with little to pay
but a woman's heart and a woman's life
are not to be won that way
i want free life and i want fresh air
and i sigh for the canter after the cattle
the crack of the whips like shots in battle
the mellay of horns, and hoofs, and heads
that wars, and wrangles, and scatters, and spreads
the green beneath and the blue above
and dash and danger, and life and love
and lasca
lasca used to ride
on a mouse-gray mustang, close to my side
with blue _serape_ and bright-belled spur
i laughed with joy as i looked at her
little knew she of books or creeds
an _ave maria_ sufficed her needs
little she cared, save to be by my side
to ride with me, and ever to ride
from san saba's shore to lavaca's tide
she was as bold as the billows that beat
she was as wild as the breezes that blow
from her little head to her little feet
she was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro
by each gust of passion; a sapling pine
that grows on the edge of a kansas bluff
and wars with the wind when the weather is rough
is like this lasca, this love of mine
she would hunger that i might eat
would take the bitter and leave me the sweet
but once, when i made her jealous for fun
at something i'd whispered, or looked, or done
one sunday, in san antonio
to a glorious girl on the alamo
she drew from her girdle a dear little dagger
and--sting of a wasp!--it made me stagger
an inch to the left or an inch to the right
and i shouldn't be maundering here to-night
but she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound
her torn _rebosa_ about the wound
that i quite forgave her. scratches don't count
in texas, down by the rio grande
her eye was brown,--a deep, deep brown
her hair was darker than her eye
and something in her smile and frown
curled crimson lip, and instep high
showed that there ran in each blue vein
mixed with the milder aztec strain
the vigorous vintage of old spain
she was alive in every limb
with feeling, to the finger tips
and when the sun is like a fire
and sky one shining, soft sapphire
one does not drink in little sips
the air was heavy, the night was hot
i sat by her side, and forgot--forgot
forgot the herd that were taking their rest
forgot that the air was close opprest
that the texas norther comes sudden and soon
in the dead of night or the blaze of noon
that once let the herd at its breath take fright
that nothing on earth can stop the flight
and woe to the rider, and woe to the steed
who falls in front of their mad stampede
was that thunder? no, by the lord
i sprang to my saddle without a word
one foot on mine, and she clung behind
away on a hot chase down the wind
but never was fox-hunt half so hard
and never was steed so little spared
for we rode for our lives. you shall hear how we fared
in texas, down by the rio grande
the mustang flew, and we urged him on
there was one chance left, and you have but one
halt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse
crouch under his carcass, and take your chance
and if the steers, in their frantic course
don't batter you both to pieces at once
you may thank your star; if not, good-by
to the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh
and the open air and the open sky
in texas, down by the rio grande
the cattle gained on us, and just as i felt
for my old six-shooter, behind in my belt
down came the mustang, and down came we
clinging together, and--what was the rest
a body that spread itself on my breast
two arms that shielded my dizzy head
two lips that hard on my lips were pressed
then came thunder in my ears
as over us surged the sea of steers
blows that beat blood into my eyes
and when i could rise
lasca was dead
i gouged out a grave a few feet deep
and there in earth's arms i laid her to sleep
and there she is lying, and no one knows
and the summer shines and the winter snows
for many a day the flowers have spread
a pall of petals over her head
and the little gray hawk hangs aloft in the air
and the sly coyote trots here and there
and the black snake glides, and glitters, and slides
into the rift in a cotton-wood tree
and the buzzard sails on
and comes and is gone
stately and still like a ship at sea
and i wonder why i do not care
for the things that are like the things that were
does half my heart lie buried there
in texas, down by the rio grande
over the hill to the poor-house i'm trudgin' my weary way
i, a woman of seventy, and only a trifle gray
i, who am smart an' chipper, for all the years i've told
as many another woman that's only half as old
over the hill to the poor-house--i can't quite make it clear
over the hill to the poor-house-it seems so horrid queer
many a step i've taken a-toiling to and fro
but this is a sort of journey i never thought to go
what is the use of heapin' on me a pauper's shame
am i lazy or crazy? am i blind or lame
true, i am not so supple, nor yet so awful stout
but charity ain't no favor, if one can live without
i am willin' and anxious an' ready any day
to work for a decent livin', an' pay my honest way
for i can earn my victuals, an' more too, i'll be bound
if anybody only is willin' to have me round
once i was young an' han'some--i was upon my soul
once my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal
and i can't remember, in them days, of hearin' people say
for any kind of a reason, that i was in their way
but many a house an' home was open then to me
many a han'some offer i had from likely men
and nobody ever hinted that i was a burden then
and when to john i was married, sure he was good and smart
but he and all the neighbors would own i done my part
for life was all before me, an' i was young an' strong
and i worked the best that i could in tryin' to get along
and so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay
with now and then a baby for to cheer us on our way
till we had half a dozen, an' all growed clean an' neat
an' went to school like others, an' had enough to eat
so we worked for the childr'n, and raised 'em every one
worked for 'em summer and winter just as we ought to've done
only, perhaps, we humored 'em, which some good folks condemn
but every couple's childr'n's a heap the best to them
strange how much we think of our blessed little ones
i'd have died for my daughters, i'd have died for my sons
and god he made that rule of love; but when we're old and gray
i've noticed it sometimes, somehow, fails to work the other way
strange, another thing: when our boys an' girls was grown
and when, exceptin' charley, they'd left us there alone
when john he nearer an' nearer come, an' dearer seemed to be
the lord of hosts he come one day, an' took him away from me
still i was bound to struggle, an' never to cringe or fall
still i worked for charley, for charley was now my all
and charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown
till at last he went a-courtin', and brought a wife from town
she was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile
she was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style
but if ever i tried to be friends, i did with her, i know
but she was hard and proud, an' i couldn't make it go
she had an edication, an' that was good for her
but when she twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too fur
an' i told her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick
that i never swallowed a grammar, or eat a 'rithmetic
so 'twas only a few days before the thing was done
they was a family of themselves, and i another one
and a very little cottage one family will do
but i never have seen a house that was big enough for two
an' i never could speak to suit her, never could please her eye
an' it made me independent, an' then i didn't try
but i was terribly staggered, an' felt it like a blow
when charley turn'd agin me, an' told me i could go
i went to live with susan, but susan's house was small
and she was always a-hintin' how snug it was for us all
and what with her husband's sisters, and what with childr'n three
an' then i went to thomas, the oldest son i've got
for thomas's buildings'd cover the half of an acre lot
but all the childr'n was on me--i couldn't stand their sauce
and thomas said i needn't think i was comin' there to boss
an' then i wrote rebecca, my girl who lives out west
and to isaac, not far from her--some twenty miles, at best
and one of 'em said 'twas too warm there for any one so old
and t'other had an opinion the climate was too cold
so they have shirked and slighted me, an' shifted me about
so they have well-nigh soured me, an' wore my old heart out
but still i've borne up pretty well, an' wasn't much put down
till charley went to the poor-master, an' put me on the town
over the hill to the poor-house--my childr'n dear, good-by
many a night i've watched you when only god was nigh
and god'll judge between us; but i will always pray
that you shall never suffer the half i do to-day
when freedom from her mountain height
unfurled her standard to the air
she tore the azure robe of night
and set the stars of glory there
she mingled with its gorgeous dyes
the milky baldric of the skies
and striped its pure celestial white
with streakings of the morning light
then from his mansion in the sun
she called her eagle bearer down
and gave into his mighty hand
the symbol of her chosen land
majestic monarch of the cloud
who rear'st aloft thy regal form
to hear the tempest trumpings loud
and see the lightning lances driven
when strive the warriors of the storm
and rolls the thunder-drum of heaven
child of the sun! to thee 'tis given
to guard the banner of the free
to hover in the sulphur smoke
to ward away the battle stroke
and bid its blendings shine afar
like rainbows on the cloud of war
the harbingers of victory
flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly
the sign of hope and triumph high
when speaks the signal trumpet tone
and the long line comes gleaming on
ere yet the lifeblood, warm and wet
has dimmed the glistening bayonet
each soldier eye shall brightly turn
to where thy sky-born glories burn
and, as his springing steps advance
catch war and vengeance from the glance
and when the cannon-mouthings loud
heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud
and gory sabres rise and fall
like shoots of flame on midnight's pall
then shall thy meteor glances glow
and cowering foes shall shrink beneath
each gallant arm that strikes below
that lovely messenger of death
flag of the seas! on ocean wave
thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave
when death, careering on the gale
sweeps darkly 'round the bellied sail
and frighted waves rush wildly back
before the broadside's reeling rack
each dying wanderer of the sea
shall look at once to heaven and thee
and smile to see thy splendors fly
in triumph o'er his closing eye
flag of the free heart's hope and home
by angel hands to valor given
thy stars have lit the welkin dome
and all thy hues were born in heaven
forever float that standard sheet
where breathes the foe but falls before us
with freedom's soil beneath our feet
and freedom's banner streaming o'er us
a bunch of golden keys is mine
to make each day with gladness shine
that unlocks every door for me
when evening comes, "good night!" i say
and close the door of each glad day
when at the table "if you please
i take from off my bunch of keys
when friends give anything to me
i'll use the little "thank you" key
when by mistake some harm i do
or if unkindly harm i've given
with "forgive me" key i'll be forgiven
on a golden ring these keys i'll bind
this is its motto: "be ye kind
i'll often use each golden key
and so a happy child i'll be
i know a place where the sun is like gold
and the cherry blooms burst like snow
and down underneath is the loveliest nook
where the four-leaf clovers grow
one leaf is for faith, and one is for hope
and one is for love, you know
and god put another one in for luck
if you search, you will find where they grow
but you must have faith and you must have hope
you must love and be strong, and so
if you work, if you wait, you will find the place
where the four-leaf clovers grow
note: a remarkable custom, brought from the old country, formerly
prevailed in the rural districts of new england. on the death of a
member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event, and
their hives dressed in mourning. this ceremonial was supposed to be
necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
new home
here is the place; right over the hill
runs the path i took
you can see the gap in the old wall still
and the stepping-stones in the shallow brook
there is the house, with the gate red-barred
and the poplars tall
and the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard
and the white horns tossing above the wall
there are the beehives ranged in the sun
and down by the brink
of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun
pansy and daffodil, rose and pink
a year has gone, as the tortoise goes
heavy and slow
and the same rose blows, and the same sun glows
and the same brook sings of a year ago
there's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze
and the june sun warm
tangles his wings of fire in the trees
setting, as then, over fernside farm
i mind me how with a lover's care
from my sunday coat
i brushed off the burs, and smoothed my hair
and cooled at the brookside my brow and throat
since we parted, a month had passed
to love, a year
down through the beeches i looked at last
on the little red gate and the well-sweep near
i can see it all now,--the slantwise rain
of light through the leaves
the sundown's blaze on her window-pane
the bloom of her roses under the eaves
just the same as a month before
the house and the trees
the barn's brown gable, the vine by the door
nothing changed but the hives of bees
before them, under the garden wall
forward and back
went drearily singing the chore-girl small
draping each hive with a shred of black
trembling, i listened; the summer sun
had the chill of snow
for i knew she was telling the bees of one
gone on the journey we all must go
then i said to myself, "my mary weeps
for the dead to-day
haply her blind grandsire sleeps
the fret and pain of his age away
but her dog whined low; on the doorway sill
with his cane to his chin
the old man sat; and the chore-girl still
sung to the bees stealing out and in
and the song she was singing ever since
in my ear sounds on
mistress mary is dead and gone
not understood, we move along asunder
our paths grow wider as the seasons creep
along the years. we marvel and we wonder
why life is life, and then we fall asleep
not understood
not understood, we gather false impressions
and hug them closer as the years go by
till virtues often seem to us transgressions
and thus men rise and fall and live and die
not understood
not understood, poor souls with stunted visions
often measure giants by their narrow gauge
the poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision
are oft impelled 'gainst those who mould the age
not understood
not understood, the secret springs of action
which lie beneath the surface and the show
are disregarded; with self-satisfaction
we judge our neighbors, and they often go
not understood
not understood, how trifles often change us
the thoughtless sentence or the fancied slight
destroy long years of friendship and estrange us
and on our souls there falls a freezing blight
not understood
not understood, how many hearts are aching
for lack of sympathy! ah! day by day
how many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking
how many noble spirits pass away
not understood
o god! that men would see a little clearer
or judge less hardly when they cannot see
o god! that men would draw a little nearer
to one another! they'd be nearer thee
and understood
the woman was old, and ragged, and gray
and bent with the chill of a winter's day
the streets were white with a recent snow
and the woman's feet with age were slow
at the crowded crossing she waited long
jostled aside by the careless throng
of human beings who passed her by
unheeding the glance of her anxious eye
down the street with laughter and shout
glad in the freedom of "school let out
come happy boys, like a flock of sheep
hailing the snow piled white and deep
past the woman, so old and gray
hastened the children on their way
none offered a helping hand to her
so weak and timid, afraid to stir
lest the carriage wheels or the horses' feet
should trample her down in the slippery street
at last came out of the merry troop
the gayest boy of all the group
he paused beside her, and whispered low
her aged hand on his strong young arm
she placed, and so without hurt or harm
he guided the trembling feet along
proud that his own were young and strong
then back again to his friends he went
his young heart happy and well content
for all she's aged, and poor, and slow
and some one, some time, may lend a hand
to help my mother--you understand
if ever she's poor, and old, and gray
and her own dear boy is far away
in her home that 'night, and the prayer she said
was: "god, be kind to that noble boy
who is somebody's son, and pride and joy
faint was the voice, and worn and weak
but the father hears when his children speak
angels caught the faltering word
and "somebody's mother's" prayer was heard
whither, midst falling dew
while glow the heavens with the last steps of day
far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
thy solitary way
vainly the fowler's eye
might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong
as, darkly seen against the crimson sky
thy figure floats along
seek'st thou the plashy brink
of weedy lake, or marge of river wide
or where the rocking billows rise and sink
on the chafed ocean-side
there is a power whose care
teaches thy way along that pathless coast
the desert and illimitable air
lone wandering, but not lost
all day thy wings have fanned
at that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere
yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land
though the dark night is near
and soon that toil shall end
soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest
and scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend
soon, o'er thy sheltered nest
thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven
hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given
and shall not soon depart
he who, from zone to zone
guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight
in the long way that i must tread alone
will lead my steps aright
who fed me from her gentle breast
and hushed me in her arms to rest
and on my cheek sweet kisses prest
my mother
when sleep forsook my open eye
who was it sung sweet lullaby
and rocked me that i should not cry
my mother
who sat and watched my infant head
when sleeping in my cradle bed
and tears of sweet affection shed
my mother
when pain and sickness made me cry
who gazed upon my heavy eye
and wept, for fear that i should die
my mother
who ran to help me when i fell
and would some pretty story tell
or kiss the part to make it well
my mother
who taught my infant lips to pray
to love god's holy word and day
and walk in wisdom's pleasant way
my mother
and can i ever cease to be
affectionate and kind to thee
who wast so very kind to me
my mother
oh, no, the thought i cannot bear
and if god please my life to spare
i hope i shall reward thy care
my mother
when thou art feeble, old and gray
my healthy arms shall be thy stay
and i will soothe thy pains away
my mother
and when i see thee hang thy head
and tears of sweet affection shed
my mother
the sun was shining on the sea
shining with all his might
he did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright
and this was odd, because it was
the middle of the night
the moon was shining sulkily
because she thought the sun
had got no business to be there
after the day was done
the sea was wet as wet could be
the sands were dry as dry
you could not see a cloud, because
no cloud was in the sky
no birds were flying overhead
there were no birds to fly
the walrus and the carpenter
were walking close at hand
they wept like anything to see
such quantities of sand
they said, "it would be grand
swept it for half a year
do you suppose," the walrus said
and shed a bitter tear
the walrus did beseech
along the briny beach
we cannot do with more than four
to give a hand to each
the eldest oyster looked at him
but never a word he said
the eldest oyster winked his eye
and shook his heavy head
meaning to say he did not choose
to leave the oyster-bed
but four young oysters hurried up
all eager for the treat
their coats were brushed, their faces washed
their shoes were clean and neat
and this was odd, because, you know
they hadn't any feet
four other oysters followed them
and yet another four
and thick and fast they came at last
and more, and more, and more
all hopping through the frothy waves
and scrambling to the shore
the walrus and the carpenter
walked on a mile or so
and then they rested on a rock
conveniently low
and all the little oysters stood
and waited in a row
of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax
of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings
for some of us are out of breath
and all of us are fat
they thanked him much for that
pepper and vinegar besides
are very good indeed
now, if you're ready, oysters dear
we can begin to feed
turning a little blue
a dismal thing to do
and you are very nice
the carpenter said nothing but
i wish you were not quite so deaf
i've had to ask you twice
after we've brought them out so far
and made them trot so quick
the carpenter said nothing but
with sobs and tears he sorted out
those of the largest size
holding his pocket-handkerchief
before his streaming eyes
shall we be trotting home again
but answer came there none
and this was scarcely odd, because
they'd eaten every one
the weary teacher sat alone
while twilight gathered on
and not a sound was heard around
the boys and girls were gone
the weary teacher sat alone
unnerved and pale was he
bowed 'neath a yoke of care, he spoke
in sad soliloquy
of labor thrown away
another chain of toil and pain
dragged through a tedious day
love's sacrifice is lost
the hopes of morn, so golden, turn
each evening, into dross
my strength, my life, my all
the seeds i sow will never grow
they perish where they fall
he sighed, and low upon his hands
his aching brow he pressed
and o'er his frame ere long there came
a soothing sense of rest
and then he lifted up his face
but started back aghast
the room, by strange and sudden change
assumed proportions vast
it seemed a senate-hall, and one
addressed a listening throng
each burning word all bosoms stirred
applause rose loud and long
the 'wildered teacher thought he knew
the speaker's voice and look
is in my record book
the stately senate-hall dissolved
a church rose in its place
wherein there stood a man of god
dispensing words of grace
and though he spoke in solemn tone
and though his hair was gray
the teacher's thought was strangely wrought
the church, a phantom, vanished soon
what saw the teacher then
in classic gloom of alcoved room
an author plied his pen
filled with a new surprise
among the great and wise
the vision of a cottage home
the teacher now descried
a mother's face illumed the place
her influence sanctified
this matron, well i know
was but a wild and careless child
not half an hour ago
of duty's golden rule
her lips repeat in accents sweet
my words to her at school
the scene was changed again, and lo
the schoolhouse rude and old
upon the wall did darkness fall
the evening air was cold
then paced along the floor
and, whistling slow and soft and low
he locked the schoolhouse door
and, walking home, his heart was full
of peace and trust and praise
and singing slow and soft and low
said, "after many days
girt round with rugged mountains, the fair lake constance lies
in her blue heart reflected shine back the starry skies
and watching each white cloudlet float silently and slow
you think a piece of heaven lies on our earth below
midnight is there: and silence, enthroned in heaven, looks down
upon her own calm mirror, upon a sleeping town
for bregenz, that quaint city upon the tyrol shore
has stood above lake constance a thousand years and more
her battlement and towers, from off their rocky steep
have cast their trembling shadow for ages on the deep
mountain, and lake, and valley, a sacred legend know
of how the town was saved, one night three hundred years ago
far from her home and kindred, a tyrol maid had fled
to serve in the swiss valleys, and toil for daily bread
and every year that fleeted so silently and fast
seemed to bear farther from her the memory of the past
she served kind, gentle masters, nor asked for rest or change
her friends seemed no more new ones, their speech seemed no more strange
and when she led her cattle to pasture every day
she ceased to look and wonder on which side bregenz lay
she spoke no more of bregenz, with longing and with tears
her tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of years
she heeded not the rumors of austrian war and strife
each day she rose, contented, to the calm toils of life
yet when her master's children would clustering round her stand
she sang them ancient ballads of her own native land
and when at morn and evening she knelt before god's throne
the accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone
and so she dwelt: the valley more peaceful year by year
when suddenly strange portents of some great deed seemed near
the golden corn was bending upon its fragile stock
while farmers, heedless of their fields, paced up and down in talk
the men seemed stern and altered, with looks cast on the ground
with anxious faces, one by one, the women gathered round
all talk of flax, or spinning, or work, was put away
the very children seemed afraid to go alone to play
one day, out in the meadow with strangers from the town
some secret plan discussing, the men walked up and down
yet now and then seemed watching a strange uncertain, gleam
that looked like lances 'mid the trees that stood below the stream
at eve they all assembled, then care and doubt were fled
with jovial laugh they feasted; the board was nobly spread
the elder of the village rose up, his glass in hand
and cried, "we drink the downfall of an accursed land
bregenz, our foeman's stronghold, bregenz shall be our own
the women shrank in terror, (yet pride, too, had her part
but one poor tyrol maiden felt death within her heart
before her stood fair bregenz, once more her towers arose
what were the friends beside her? only her country's foes
the faces of her kinsfolk, the days of childhood flown
the echoes of her mountains, reclaimed her as their own
nothing she heard around her, (though shouts rang forth again
gone were the green swiss valleys, the pasture, and the plain
before her eyes one vision, and in her heart one cry
that said, "go forth, save bregenz, and then, if need be, die
with trembling haste and breathless, with noiseless step, she sped
horses and weary cattle were standing in the shed
she loosed the strong white charger, that fed from out her hand
she mounted, and she turned his head towards her native land
out--out into the darkness--faster, and still more fast
the smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut wood is past
she looks up; clouds are heavy: why is her steed so slow
scarcely the wind beside them can pass them as they go
but louder than bells' ringing, or lowing of the kine
grows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the rhine
shall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop check
the steed draws back in terror, she leans upon his neck
to watch the flowing darkness,--the bank is high and steep
one pause--he staggers forward, and plunges in the deep
she strives to pierce the blackness, and looser throws the rein
her steed must breast the waters that dash above his mane
how gallantly, how nobly, he struggles through the foam
and see--in the far distance shine out the lights of home
up the steep bank he bears her, and now they rush again
toward the heights of bregenz, that tower above the plain
they reach the gate of bregenz, just as the midnight rings
and out come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings
bregenz is saved! ere daylight her battlements are manned
defiance greets the army that marches on the land
and if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid
bregenz does well to honor the noble tyrol maid
three hundred years are vanished, and yet upon the hill
an old stone gateway rises, to do her honor still
and there, when bregenz women sit spinning in the shade
they see in quaint old carving the charger and the maid
and when, to guard old bregenz, by gateway, street, and tower
the warder paces all night long, and calls each passing hour
when midnight pauses in the skies he calls the maiden's name
better than grandeur, better than gold
than rank and title a thousand fold
is a healthy body, a mind at ease
and simple pleasures that always please
a heart that can feel for a neighbor's woe
and share his joys with a genial glow
with sympathies large enough to enfold
all men as brothers,--is better than gold
better than gold is a conscience clear
though toiling for bread in an humble sphere
doubly blest with content and health
untried by the lusts or cares of wealth
lowly living and lofty thought
adorn and ennoble a poor man's cot
for mind and morals, in nature's plan
are the genuine test of a gentleman
better than gold is the sweet repose
of the sons of toil when their labors close
better than gold is the poor man's sleep
and the balm that drops on his slumbers deep
bring sleeping draughts to the downy bed
where luxury pillows his aching head
his simple opiate labor deems
a shorter road to the land of dreams
better than gold is a thinking mind
that in the realm of books can find
a treasure surpassing australian ore
and live with the great and good of yore
the sage's lore and the poet's lay
the glories of empires pass'd away
the world's great drama will thus unfold
and yield a pleasure better than gold
better than gold is a peaceful home
where all the fireside charities come
the shrine of love and the heaven of life
hallowed by mother, or sister, or wife
however humble the home may be
or tried with sorrow by heaven's decree
the blessings that never were bought or sold
and center there, are better than gold
o suns and skies and clouds of june
and flowers of june together
ye cannot rival for one hour
october's bright blue weather
when loud the bumblebee makes haste
belated, thriftless vagrant
and goldenrod is dying fast
and lanes with grapes are fragrant
when gentians roll their fringes tight
to save them for the morning
and chestnuts fall from satin burrs
without a sound of warning
when on the ground red apples lie
in piles like jewels shining
and redder still on old stone walls
are leaves of woodbine twining
when all the lovely wayside things
their white-winged seeds are sowing
and in the fields, still green and fair
late aftermaths are growing
when springs run low, and on the brooks
in idle, golden freighting
bright leaves sink noiseless in the hush
of woods, for winter waiting
when comrades seek sweet country haunts
by twos and threes together
and count like misers hour by hour
october's bright blue weather
o suns and skies and flowers of june
count all your boasts together
love loveth best of all the year
october's bright blue weather
said brier-rose's mother to the naughty brier-rose
you will not scrub the kettles, and you will not touch the broom
you never sit a minute still at spinning-wheel or loom
thus grumbled in the morning, and grumbled late at eve
the good-wife as she bustled with pot and tray and sieve
but brier-rose, she laughed and she cocked her dainty head
to marry such a worthless wench, these seven leagues around
but brier-rose, she laughed and she trilled a merry lay
the good-wife with a "humph" and a sigh forsook the battle
and flung her pots and pails about with much vindictive rattle
that thou hast punished me in age with such a wayward child
up stole the girl on tiptoe, so that none her step could hear
and laughing pressed an airy kiss behind the good-wife's ear
and she, as e'er relenting, sighed: "oh, heaven only knows
whatever will become of you, my naughty brier-rose
the sun was high and summer sounds were teeming in the air
the clank of scythes, the cricket's whir, and swelling woodnotes rare
from fields and copse and meadow; and through the open door
sweet, fragrant whiffs of new-mown hay the idle breezes bore
then brier-rose grew pensive, like a bird of thoughtful mien
whose little life has problems among the branches green
she heard the river brawling where the tide was swift and strong
she heard the summer singing its strange, alluring song
and out she skipped the meadows o'er and gazed into the sky
her heart o'erbrimmed with gladness, she scarce herself knew why
and to a merry tune she hummed, "oh, heaven only knows
whatever will become of the naughty brier-rose
whene'er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied
she shook her head in warning, and scarce her wrath could hide
for girls were made for housewives, for spinning-wheel and loom
and not to drink the sunshine and wild flower's sweet perfume
and oft the maidens cried, when the brier-rose went by
but brier-rose, as was her wont, she cocked her curly head
and oft the young lads shouted, when they saw the maid at play
then she shook her tiny fist; to her cheeks the color flew
till she was twenty summers old and yet remained unwed
and all the parish wondered: "the lord almighty knows
whatever will become of that naughty brier-rose
and while they wondered came the spring a-dancing o'er the hills
her breath was warmer than of yore, and all the mountain rills
with their tinkling and their rippling and their rushing, filled the air
and the misty sounds of water forth-welling everywhere
and in the valley's depth, like a lusty beast of prey
the river leaped and roared aloud and tossed its mane of spray
then hushed again its voice to a softly plashing croon
as dark it rolled beneath the sun and white beneath the moon
it was a merry sight to see the lumber as it whirled
adown the tawny eddies that hissed and seethed and swirled
now shooting through the rapids and, with a reeling swing
into the foam-crests diving like an animated thing
but in the narrows of the rocks, where o'er a steep incline
the waters plunged, and wreathed in foam the dark boughs of the pine
the lads kept watch with shout and song, and sent each straggling beam
a-spinning down the rapids, lest it should lock the stream
a rush of feet, a dog's harsh bark, a torch's flaring light
and wandering gusts of dampness, and round us far and nigh
a throbbing boom of water like a pulse-beat in the sky
the dawn just pierced the pallid east with spears of gold and red
as we, with boat-hooks in our hands, toward the narrows sped
and terror smote us; for we heard the mighty tree-tops sway
and thunder, as of chariots, and hissing showers of spray
a hundred crowns i give to him who breaks the lumber lock
for if another hour go by, the angry waters' spoil
our homes will be, and fields, and our weary years of toil
we looked each at the other; each hoped his neighbor would
brave death and danger for his home, as valiant norsemen should
but at our feet the brawling tide expanded like a lake
and whirling beams came shooting on, and made the firm rock quake
but not a man came forward, and no one spoke or stirred
and nothing save the thunder of the cataract was heard
but as with trembling hands and with fainting hearts we stood
we spied a little curly head emerging from the wood
we heard a little snatch of a merry little song
and saw the dainty brier-rose come dancing through the throng
an angry murmur rose from the people round about
why ever he created that worthless brier-rose
sweet brier-rose, she heard their cries; a little pensive smile
across her fair face flitted that might a stone beguile
and then she gave her pretty head a roguish little cock
derisive shouts of laughter broke from throats of young and old
and, mockingly, a boat-hook into her hands was flung
when, lo! into the river's midst with daring leaps she sprung
we saw her dimly through a mist of dense and blinding spray
from beam to beam she skipped, like a water-sprite at play
and now and then faint gleams we caught of color through the mist
a crimson waist, a golden head, a little dainty wrist
in terror pressed the people to the margin of the hill
a hundred breaths were bated, a hundred hearts stood still
for, hark! from out the rapids came a strange and creaking sound
and then a crash of thunder which shook the very ground
the waters hurled the lumber mass down o'er the rocky steep
we heard a muffled rumbling and a rolling in the deep
we saw a tiny form which the torrent swiftly bore
and flung into the wild abyss, where it was seen no more
ah, little naughty brier-rose, thou couldst not weave nor spin
yet thou couldst do a nobler deed than all thy mocking kin
for thou hadst courage e'en to die, and by thy death to save
a thousand farms and lives from the fury of the wave
and yet the adage lives, in the valley of thy birth
when wayward children spend their days in heedless play and mirth
oft mothers say, half smiling, half sighing, "heaven knows
whatever will become of the naughty brier-rose
robert of sicily, brother of pope urbane
and valmond, emperor of allemaine
appareled in magnificent attire
with retinue of many a knight and squire
on st. john's eve, at vespers, proudly sat
and heard the priests chant the magnificat
and as he listened, o'er and o'er again
repeated, like a burden or refrain
he caught the words, _"deposuit potentes
de sede, et exaltavit humiles
and slowly lifting up his kingly head
he to a learned clerk beside him said
and has exalted them of low degree
thereat king robert muttered scornfully
only by priests, and in the latin tongue
for unto priests, and people be it known
there is no power can push me from my throne
and leaning back he yawned and fell asleep
lulled by the chant monotonous and deep
when he awoke, it was already night
the church was empty, and there was no light
save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint
lighted a little space before some saint
he started from his seat and gazed around
but saw no living thing and heard no sound
he groped towards the door, but it was locked
he cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked
and uttered awful threatenings and complaints
and imprecations upon men and saints
the sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
as if dead priests were laughing in their stalls
at length the sexton, hearing from without
the tumult of the knocking and the shout
and thinking thieves were in the house of prayer
came with his lantern, asking "who is there
half choked with rage, king robert fiercely said
the frightened sexton, muttering with a curse
turned the great key and flung the portal wide
a man rushed by him at a single stride
haggard, half-naked, without hat or cloak
who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke
but leaped into the blackness of the night
and vanished like a spectre from his sight
robert of sicily, brother of pope urbane
and valmond, emperor of allemaine
despoiled of his magnificent attire
bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches' glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard, but did not heed
until at last he reached the banquet-room
blazing with light, and breathing with perfume
there on the dais sat another king
wearing his robes, his crown, his signet ring
king robert's self in features, form, and height
but all transfigured with angelic light
it was an angel; and his presence there
with a divine effulgence filled the air
an exaltation, piercing the disguise
though none the hidden angel recognize
a moment speechless, motionless, amazed
the throneless monarch on the angel gazed
who met his look of anger and surprise
with the divine compassion of his eyes
then said, "who art thou, and why com'st thou here
to which king robert answered with a sneer
from an impostor, who usurps my throne
and suddenly, at these audacious words
up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords
the angel answered with unruffled brow
henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape
and for thy counselor shalt lead an ape
thou shalt obey my servants when they call
and wait upon my henchmen in the hall
deaf to king robert's threats and cries and prayers
they thrust him from the hall and down the stairs
a group of tittering pages ran before
and as they opened wide the folding door
his heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms
the boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms
and all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
with the mock plaudits of "long live the king
next morning, waking with the day's first beam
he said within himself, "it was a dream
but the straw rustled as he turned his head
there were the cap and bells beside his bed
around him rose the bare, discolored walls
close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls
and in the corner, a revolting shape
shivering and chattering, sat the wretched ape
it was no dream; the world he loved so much
had turned to dust and ashes at his touch
days came and went; and now returned again
to sicily the old saturnian reign
under the angel's governance benign
the happy island danced with corn and wine
and deep within the mountain's burning breast
enceladus, the giant, was at rest
meanwhile king robert yielded to his fate
sullen and silent and disconsolate
dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear
with look bewildered, and a vacant stare
close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn
by courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn
his only friend the ape, his only food
what others left--he still was unsubdued
and when the angel met him on his way
and half in earnest, half in jest, would say
sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel
the velvet scabbard held a sword of steel
burst from him in resistless overflow
and lifting high his forehead, he would fling
the haughty answer back, "i am, i am the king
almost three years were ended, when there came
ambassadors of great repute and name
from valmond, emperor of allemaine
unto king robert, saying that pope urbane
by letter summoned them forthwith to come
on holy thursday to his city of rome
the angel with great joy received his guests
and gave them presents of embroidered vests
and velvet mantles with rich ermine lined
and rings and jewels of the rarest kind
then he departed with them o'er the sea
into the lovely land of italy
whose loveliness was more resplendent made
by the mere passing of that cavalcade
with plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir
of jeweled bridle and of golden spur
and lo! among the menials, in mock state
upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait
his cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind
the solemn ape demurely perched behind
king robert rode, making huge merriment
in all the country towns through which they went
the pope received them with great pomp, and blare
of bannered trumpets, on st. peter's square
giving his benediction and embrace
fervent, and full of apostolic grace
while with congratulations and with prayers
he entertained the angel unawares
robert, the jester, bursting through the crowd
into their presence rushed, and cried aloud
robert, your brother, king of sicily
this man, who wears my semblance to your eyes
is an impostor in a king's disguise
do you not know me? does no voice within
answer my cry, and say we are akin
the pope in silence, but with troubled mien
gazed at the angel's countenance serene
the emperor, laughing, said, "it is strange sport
to keep a mad man for thy fool at court
and the poor, baffled jester, in disgrace
was hustled back among the populace
in solemn state the holy week went by
and easter sunday gleamed upon the sky
the presence of the angel, with its light
before the sun rose, made the city bright
and with new fervor filled the hearts of men
who felt that christ indeed had risen again
even the jester, on his bed of straw
with haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw
he felt within a power unfelt before
and kneeling humbly on his chamber floor
he heard the rustling garments of the lord
sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward
and now the visit ending, and once more
valmond returning to the danube's shore
homeward the angel journeyed, and again
the land was made resplendent with his train
flashing along the towns of italy
unto salerno, and from thence by sea
and when once more within palermo's wall
and, seated on the throne in his great hall
he heard the angelus from convent towers
as if the better world conversed with ours
he beckoned to king robert to draw nigher
and with a gesture bade the rest retire
and when they were alone, the angel said
king robert crossed both hands upon his breast
and meekly answered him, "thou knowest best
my sins as scarlet are; let me go hence
and in some cloister's school of penitence
across those stones that pave the way to heaven
walk barefoot till my guilty soul be shriven
the angel smiled, and from his radiant face
a holy light illumined all the place
and through the open window, loud and clear
they heard the monks chant in the chapel near
above the stir and tumult of the street
and has exalted them of low degree
and through the chant a second melody
rose like the throbbing of a single string
king robert, who was standing near the throne
lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone
but all appareled as in days of old
with ermined mantle and with cloth of gold
and when his courtiers came they found him there
kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer
it was late in mild october, and the long autumnal rain
had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again
the first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay
with the hues of summer's rainbow, or the meadow-flowers of may
through a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red
at first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped
yet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued
on the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood
and all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night
he wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light
slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill
and beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still
and shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky
flecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why
and schoolgirls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks
mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks
from spire and ball looked westerly the patient weathercock
but even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks
no sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel's dropping shell
and the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they fell
the summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry
where june winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye
but still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood
ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood
bent low, by autumn's wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sere
unfolded by their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear
beneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold
and glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin's sphere of gold
there wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain
bore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain
till broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last
and like a merry guest's farewell, the day in brightness passed
and lo! as through the western pines on meadow, stream, and pond
flamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond
slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone
and the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one
as thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away
and deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay
from many a brown old farm-house, and hamlet without name
their milking and their home-tasks done, the merry huskers came
swung o'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow
shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below
the growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before
and laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o'er
half hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart
talking their old times over, the old men sat apart
while, up and down the unhusked pile, or nestling in its shade
at hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children played
urged by the good host's daughter, a maiden young and fair
lifting to light her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair
the master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue
to the quaint tune of some old psalm, a husking-ballad sung
if ever there lived a yankee lad
wise or otherwise, good or bad
who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump
with flapping arms from stake or stump
or, spreading the tail
of his coat for a sail
take a soaring leap from post or rail
and wonder why
he couldn't fly
and flap and flutter and wish and try
if ever you knew a country dunce
who didn't try that as often as once
all i can say is, that's a sign
he never would do for a hero of mine
an aspiring genius was d. green
the son of a farmer,--age fourteen
his body was long and lank and lean
just right for flying, as will be seen
he had two eyes, each bright as a bean
and a freckled nose that grew between
a little awry,--for i must mention
that he had riveted his attention
upon his wonderful invention
twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings
working his face as he worked the wings
and with every turn of gimlet and screw
turning and screwing his mouth round, too
till his nose seemed bent
to catch the scent
around some corner, of new-baked pies
and his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes
grew puckered into a queer grimace
that made him look very droll in the face
and also very wise
and wise he must have been, to do more
than ever a genius did before
excepting daedalus of yore
and his son icarus, who wore
upon their backs
those wings of wax
he had read of in the old almanacs
darius was clearly of the opinion
that the air is also man's dominion
and that, with paddle or fin or pinion
we soon or late
shall navigate
the azure as now we sail the sea
the thing looks simple enough to me
and if you doubt it
hear how darius reasoned about it
must we give in
says he with a grin
are smarter'n we be
jest fold our hands an' see the swaller
an' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler
does the leetle, chatterin', sassy wren
no bigger'n my thumb, know more than men
jest show me that
er prove 't the bat
has got more brains than's in my hat
an' i'll back down, an' not till then
he argued further: "ner i can't see
what's ta' use o' wings to a bumblebee
fer to git a livin' with, more'n to me
ain't my business
important's his'n is
that icarus
was a silly cuss
him an' his daddy daedalus
they might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax
wouldn't stan' sun-heat an' hard whacks
i'll make mine o' luther
er suthin' er other
and he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned
to mummies that never can understand
the fust idee that's big an' grand
they'd 'a' laft an' made fun
o' creation itself afore't was done
so he kept his secret from all the rest
safely buttoned within his vest
and in the loft above the shed
himself he locks, with thimble and thread
and wax and hammer and buckles and screws
and all such things as geniuses use
two bats for patterns, curious fellows
a charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows
an old hoop-skirt or two, as well as
some wire and several old umbrellas
a carriage-cover, for tail and wings
a piece of harness; and straps and strings
and a big strong boxs
in which he locks
these and a hundred other things
his grinning brothers, reuben and burke
and nathan and jotham and solomon, lurk
around the corner to see him work
sitting cross-legged, like a turk
drawing the waxed end through with a jerk
and boring the holes with a comical quirk
of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk
but vainly they mounted each other's backs
and poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks
with wood from the pile and straw from the stacks
he plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks
and a bucket of water, which one would think
he had brought up into the loft to drink
when he chanced to be dry
stood always nigh
for darius was sly
and whenever at work he happened to spy
at chink or crevice a blinking eye
he let a dipper of water fly
guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep
and he sings as he locks
his big strong box
an' he is leetle an' long an' slim
an' quick of motion an' nimble of limb
an' ef yeou'll be
advised by me
keep wide awake when ye're ketchin' him
so day after day
he stitched and tinkered and hammered away
till at last 'twas done
the greatest invention under the sun
and the weather was dry
and not a cloud was on all the sky
save a few light fleeces, which here and there
half mist, half air
like foam on the ocean went floating by
just as lovely a morning as ever was seen
for a nice little trip in a flying-machine
thought cunning darius: "now i sha'n't go
along 'ith the fellers to see the show
i'll say i've got sich a terrible cough
an' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off
i'll hev full swing
for to try the thing
an' practyse a leetle on the wing
says brother nate. "no; botheration
my gracious!--feel's though i should fly
said jotham, "sho
guess ye better go
but darius said, "no
shouldn't wonder 'f yeou might see me, though
o' this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head
for all the while to himself he said
i'll fly a few times around the lot
to see how 't seems, then soon's i've got
the hang o' the thing, ez likely's not
i'll astonish the nation
and all creation
by flyin' over the celebration
over their heads i'll sail like an eagle
i'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull
i'll dance on the chimbleys; i'll stan' on the steeple
i'll flop up to winders an' scare the people
i'll light on the libbe'ty-pole, an' crow
an' i'll say to the gawpin' fools below
that i've come near
fer i'll make 'em believe i'm a chap f'm the moon
an' i'll try a race 'ith their ol' bulloon
he crept from his bed
and, seeing the others were gone, he said
i'm a-gittin' over the cold 'n my head
and away he sped
to open the wonderful box in the shed
his brothers had walked but a little way
when jotham to nathan chanced to say
er he wouldn't 'a' stayed to hum to-day
says burke, "his toothache's all 'n his eye
ef he hedn't some machine to try
le's hurry back and hide in the barn
an' pay him fer tellin' us that yarn
along by the fences, behind the stack
and one by one, through a hole in the wall
in under the dusty barn they crawl
dressed in their sunday garments all
and a very astonishing sight was that
when each in his cobwebbed coat and hat
came up through the floor like an ancient rat
and there they hid
and reuben slid
the fastenings back, and the door undid
as knights of old put on their mail
from head to foot
an iron suit
iron jacket and iron boot
iron breeches, and on the head
no hat, but an iron pot instead
and under the chin the bail
i believe they called the thing a helm
and the lid they carried they called a shield
and, thus accoutred, they took the field
sallying forth to overwhelm
the dragons and pagans that plagued the realm
so this modern knight
prepared for flight
put on his wings and strapped them tight
jointed and jaunty, strong and light
buckled them fast to shoulder and hip
ten feet they measured from tip to tip
and a helm had he, but that he wore
not on his head like those of yore
but more like the helm of a ship
he's opened the winder,--i see his head
he stretches it out
an' pokes it about
lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear
an' nobody near
guess he don'o' who's hid in here
he's riggin' a spring-board over the sill
stop laffin', solomon! burke, keep still
he's a climbin' out now--of all the things
what's he got on? i van, it's wings
an' that t'other thing? i vum, it's a tail
an' there he sets like a hawk on a rail
steppin' careful, he travels the length
of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength
now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat
peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that
fer to see 'f the' 's anyone passin' by
but the' 's on'y a ca'f an' a goslin' nigh
to see--the dragon! he's goin' to fly
away he goes! jimmmy! what a jump
flop-flop-an' plump
to the ground with a thump
flutt'rin an' flound'rin', all in a lump
as a demon is hurled by an angel's spear
heels over head, to his proper sphere
heels over head, and head over heels
dizzily down the abyss he wheels
so fell darius. upon his crown
in the midst of the barnyard, he came down
in a wonderful whirl of tangled strings
broken braces and broken springs
broken tail and broken wings
shooting-stars, and various things
away with a bellow fled the calf
and what was that? did the gosling laugh
from the old barn-door
and he hears the voice of jotham crying
slowly, ruefully, where he lay
darius just turned and looked that way
as he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff
he said; "but the' ain't sich a thunder-in' sight
o' fun in 't when ye come to light
i just have room for the moral here
and this is the moral,--stick to your sphere
or if you insist, as you have the right
on spreading your wings for a loftier flight
the moral is,--take care how you light
with fingers weary and worn
with eyelids heavy and red
a woman sat, in unwomanly rags
plying her needle and thread
stitch! stitch! stitch
in poverty, hunger and dirt
and still with a voice of dolorous pitch
she sang the "song of the shirt
while the cock is crowing aloof
and work--work--work
till the stars shine through the roof
it's oh! to be a slave
along with the barbarous turk
where a woman has never a soul to save
if this is christian work
till the brain begins to swim
work--work--work
till the eyes are heavy and dim
seam, and gusset, and band
band, and gusset, and seam
till over the buttons i fall asleep
and sew them on in a dream
o men, with mothers and wives
it is not linen you're wearing out
but human creatures' lives
stitch--stitch--stitch
in poverty, hunger, and dirt
sewing at once, with a double thread
a shroud as well as a shirt
that phantom of grisly bone
i hardly fear his terrible shape
it seems so like my own
it seems so like my own
because of the fasts i keep
o god! that bread should be so dear
and flesh and blood so cheap
my labor never flags
and what are its wages? a bed of straw
a crust of bread--and rags
that shattered roof--this naked floor
a table--a broken chair
and a wall so blank, my shadow i thank
for sometimes falling there
from weary chime to chime
work--work--work
as prisoners work for crime
band, and gusset, and seam
seam, and gusset, and band
till the heart is sick and the brain benumbed
as well as the weary hand
in the dull december light
and work--work--work
when the weather is warm, and bright
while underneath the eaves
the brooding swallows cling
as if to show me their sunny backs
and twit me with the spring
of the cowslip and primrose sweet
with the sky above my head
and the grass beneath my feet
for only one short hour
to feel as i used to feel
before i knew the woes of want
and the walk that costs a meal
a respite, however brief
no blessed leisure for love or hope
but only time for grief
a little weeping would ease my heart
but in their briny bed
my tears must stop, for every drop
hinders needle and thread
with fingers weary and worn
with eyelids heavy and red
a woman sat, in unwomanly rags
plying her needle and thread
stitch! stitch! stitch
in poverty, hunger and dirt
and still with a voice of dolorous pitch
would that its tone could reach the rich
she sang this "song of the shirt
everywhere, everywhere, christmas to-night
christmas in lands of the fir-tree and pine
christmas in lands of the palm-tree and vine
christmas where snow-peaks stand solemn and white
christmas where corn-fields lie sunny and bright
everywhere, everywhere, christmas to-night
christmas where children are hopeful and gay
christmas where old men are patient and gray
christmas where peace, like a dove in its flight
broods o'er brave men in the thick of the fight
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight
for the christ-child who comes is the master of all
no palace too great and no cottage too small
the angels who welcome him sing from the height
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight
then let every heart keep its christmas within
christ's pity for sorrow, christ's hatred of sin
christ's care for the weakest, christ's courage for right
christ's dread of the darkness, christ's love of the light
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight
so the stars of the midnight which compass us round
shall see a strange glory, and hear a sweet sound
and cry, "look! the earth is aflame with delight
o sons of the morning, rejoice at the sight
everywhere, everywhere, christmas tonight
i bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers
from the seas and the streams
i bear light shade for the leaves when laid
in their noon-day dreams
from my wings are shaken the dews that waken
the sweet buds every one
when rocked to rest on their mother's breast
as she dances about the sun
i wield the flail of the lashing hail
and whiten the green plains under
and then again i dissolve it in rain
and laugh as i pass in thunder
i sift the snow on the mountains below
and their great pines groan aghast
and all the night 'tis my pillow white
while i sleep in the arms of the blast
sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers
lightning my pilot sits
in a cavern under is fettered the thunder
it struggles and howls at fits
over earth and ocean, with gentle motion
this pilot is guiding me
lured by the love of the genii that move
in the depths of the purple sea
over the rills, and the crags, and the hills
over the lakes and the plains
wherever he dream, under mountain or stream
the spirit he loves remains
and i all the while bask in heaven's blue smile
whilst he is dissolving in rains
the sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes
and his burning plumes outspread
leaps on the back of my sailing rack
when the morning star shines dead
as on the jag of a mountain crag
which an earthquake rocks and swings
an eagle alit one moment may sit
in the light of its golden wings
and when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath
its ardors of rest and of love
and the crimson pall of eve may fall
from the depth of heaven above
with wings folded i rest, on mine airy nest
as still as a brooding dove
that orbed maiden, with white fire laden
whom mortals call the moon
glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor
by the midnight breezes strewn
and wherever the beat of her unseen feet
which only the angels hear
may have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof
the stars peep behind her and peer
and i laugh to see them whirl and flee
like a swarm of golden bees
when i widen the rent in my windbuilt tent
till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas
like strips of the sky fallen thro' me on high
are each paved with the moon and these
i bind the sun's throne with a burning zone
and the moon's with a girdle of pearl
the volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim
when the whirlwinds my banner unfurl
from cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape
over a torrent sea
sunbeam-proof, i hang like a roof
the mountains its columns be
the triumphal arch thro' which i march
with hurricane, fire, and snow
when the powers of the air are chained to my chair
is the million-colored bow
the sphere-fire above its soft colors wove
whilst the moist earth was laughing below
i am the daughter of earth and water
and the nursling of the sky
i pass thro' the pores of the ocean and shores
i change, but i cannot die
for after the rain, when, with never a stain
the pavilion of heaven is bare
and the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
build up the blue dome of air
i silently laugh at my own cenotaph
and out of the caverns of rain
like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb
i arise and unbuild it again
hail to thee, blithe spirit
bird thou never wert
that from heaven, or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art
higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest
in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are bright'ning
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun
the pale purple even
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen, but yet i hear thy shrill delight
keen as are the arrows
of that silver sphere
whose intense lamp narrows
in the white dawn clear
until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there
all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud
as, when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed
what thou art we know not
what is most like thee
from rainbow clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody
like a poet hidden
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not
like a high-born maiden
in a palace-tower
soothing her love-laden
soul in secret hour
with music sweet as love, which overflows her bower
like a glow-worm golden
in a dell of dew
scattering unbeholden
its aerial hue
among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view
like a rose embowered
in its own green leaves
by warm winds deflowered
till the scent it gives
makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves
sound of vernal showers
on the twinkling grass
rain-awakened flowers
all that ever was
joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass
teach us, sprite or bird
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine
chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chaunt
matched with thine would be all
but an empty vaunt
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want
what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain
what fields, or waves, or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain
with thy clear keen joyance
languor cannot be
shadow of annoyance
never came near thee
thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety
waking or asleep
thou of death must deem
things more true and deep
than we mortals dream
or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream
we look before and after
and pine for what is not
our sincerest laughter
with some pain is fraught
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought
yet if we could scorn
hate, and pride, and fear
if we were things born
not to a shed a tear
i know not how thy joy we ever should come near
better than all measures
of delightful sound
better than all treasures
that in books are found
thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground
teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then, as i am listening now
i come from haunts of coot and hern
i make a sudden sally
and sparkle out among the fern
to bicker down a valley
by thirty hills i hurry down
or slip between the ridges
by twenty thorps, a little town
and half a hundred bridges
till last by philip's farm i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever
i chatter over stony ways
in little sharps and trebles
i bubble into eddying bays
i babble on the pebbles
with many a curve my banks i fret
by many a field and fallow
and many a fairy foreland set
with willow-weed and mallow
i chatter, chatter as i flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever
i wind about, and in and out
with here a blossom sailing
and here and there a lusty trout
and here and there a grayling
and here and there a foamy flake
upon me as i travel
with many a silvery waterbreak
above the golden gravel
and draw them all along, and flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever
i steal by lawns and grassy plots
i slide by hazel covers
i move the sweet forget-me-nots
that grow for happy lovers
i slip, i slide, i gloom, i glance
among my skimming swallows
i make the netted sunbeam dance
against my sandy shallows
i murmur under moon and stars
in brambly wildernesses
i linger by my shingly bars
i loiter round my cresses
and out again i curve and flow
to join the brimming river
for men may come and men may go
but i go on forever
no price is set on the lavish summer
june may be had by the poorest comer
and what is so rare as a day in june
then, if ever, come perfect days
then heaven tries earth if it be in tune
and over it softly her warm ear lays
whether we look, or whether we listen
we hear life murmur, or see it glisten
every clod feels a stir of might
an instinct within it that reaches and towers
and, groping blindly above it for light
climbs to a soul in grass and flowers
the flush of life may well be seen
thrilling back over hills and valleys
the cowslip startles in meadows green
the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice
and there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
to be some happy creature's palace
the little bird sits at his door in the sun
atilt like a blossom among the leaves
and lets his illumined being o'errun
with the deluge of summer it receives
his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings
and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings
he sings to the wide world, and she to her nest
in the nice ear of nature, which song is the best
now is the high-tide of the year
and whatever of life hath ebbed away
comes flooding back, with a ripply cheer
into every bare inlet and creek and bay
now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it
we are happy now because god wills it
no matter how barren the past may have been
we sit in the warm shade and feel right well
how the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell
we may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing
that skies are clear and grass is growing
the breeze comes whispering in our ear
that dandelions are blossoming near
that maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing
that the river is bluer than the sky
that the robin is plastering his house hard by
and if the breeze kept the good news back
for other couriers we should not lack
we could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing
and hark! how clear bold chanticleer
warmed with the new wine of the year
tells all in his lusty crowing
joy comes, grief goes, we know not how
everything is happy now
everything is upward striving
as for grass to be green or skies to be blue
who knows whither the clouds have fled
in the unscarred heaven they leave no wake
and the eyes forget the tears they have shed
the heart forgets its sorrow and ache
the soul partakes the season's youth
and the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe
lie deep 'neath a silence pure and smooth
like burnt-out craters healed with snow
come, let us plant the apple-tree
cleave the tough greensward with the spade
wide let its hollow bed be made
there gently lay the roots, and there
sift the dark mould with kindly care
and press it o'er them tenderly
as round the sleeping infant's feet
we softly fold the cradle-sheet
so plant we the apple tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
buds, which the breath of summer days
shall lengthen into leafy sprays
boughs where the thrush with crimson breast
shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest
we plant, upon the sunny lea
a shadow for the noontide hour
a shelter from the summer shower
when we plant the apple-tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
sweets for a hundred flowery springs
to load the may-wind's restless wings
when, from the orchard row, he pours
its fragrance through our open doors
a world of blossoms for the bee
flowers for the sick girl's silent room
for the glad infant sprigs of bloom
we plant with the apple-tree
what plant we in this apple-tree
fruits that shall swell in sunny june
and redden in the august noon
and drop, when gentle airs come by
that fan the blue september sky
while children come, with cries of glee
and seek them where the fragrant grass
betrays their bed to those who pass
at the foot of the apple tree
and when, above this apple tree
the winter stars are quivering bright
and winds go howling through the night
girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth
shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth
and guests in prouder homes shall see
heaped with the grape of cintra's vine
and golden orange of the line
the fruit of the apple-tree
the fruitage of this apple-tree
winds, and our flag of stripe and star
shall bear to coasts that lie afar
where men shall wonder at the view
and ask in what fair groves they grew
and sojourners beyond the sea
shall think of childhood's careless day
and long, long hours of summer play
in the shade of the apple-tree
each year shall give this apple-tree
a broader flush of roseate bloom
a deeper maze of verdurous gloom
and loosen, when the frost-clouds lower
the crisp brown leaves in thicker shower
the years shall come and pass, but we
shall hear no longer, where we lie
the summer's songs, the autumn's sigh
in the boughs of the apple-tree
and time shall waste this apple tree
oh, when its aged branches throw
thin shadows on the ground below
shall fraud and force and iron will
oppress the weak and helpless still
what shall the tasks of mercy be
amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
of those who live when length of years
is wasting this apple-tree
the children of that distant day
thus to some aged man shall say
and, gazing on its mossy stem
the gray-haired man shall answer them
born in the rude but good old times
on planting the apple-tree
who is the happy warrior? who is he
that every man in arms should wish to be
among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought
whose high endeavors are an inward light
that makes the path before him always bright
who, with a natural instinct to discern
what knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn
abides by this resolve, and stops not there
but makes his moral being his prime care
who, doomed to go in company with pain
and fear, and bloodshed, miserable train
turns his necessity to glorious gain
in face of these doth exercise a power
which is our human nature's highest dower
controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
of their bad influence, and their good receives
by objects, which might force the soul to abate
her feeling, rendered more compassionate
is placable--because occasions rise
so often that demand such sacrifice
more skillful in self-knowledge, even more pure
as tempted more; more able to endure
as more exposed to suffering and distress
thence also, more alive to tenderness
upon that law as on the best of friends
whence, in a state where men are tempted still
to evil for a guard against worse ill
and what in quality or act is best
doth seldom on a right foundation rest
he labors good on good to fix, and owes
to virtue every triumph that he knows
rises by open means; and there will stand
on honorable terms, or else retire
and in himself possess his own desire
who comprehends his trust, and to the same
keeps faithful with a singleness of aim
and therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
for wealth, or honors, or for worldly state
whom they must follow; on whose head must fall
like showers of manna, if they come at all
whose powers shed round him in the common strife
or mild concerns of ordinary life
a constant influence, a peculiar grace
but who, if he be called upon to face
some awful moment to which heaven has joined
great issues, good or bad for human kind
is happy as a lover; and attired
with sudden brightness, like a man inspired
and, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law
in calmness made, and sees what he foresaw
or if an unexpected call succeed
come when it will, is equal to the need
and faculty for storm and turbulence
is yet a soul whose master-bias leans
to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes
sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be
are at his heart; and such fidelity
it is his darling passion to approve
more brave for this, that he hath much to love
conspicuous object in a nation's eye
or left unthought-of in obscurity
who, with a toward or untoward lot
prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not
plays, in the many games of life, that one
where what he most doth value must be won
whom neither shape of danger can dismay
nor thought of tender happiness betray
who, not content that former worth stand fast
looks forward, persevering to the last
from well to better, daily self-surpast
who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
forever, and to noble deeds give birth
or he must fall, to sleep without his fame
and leave a dead unprofitable name
finds comfort in himself and in his cause
and, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
his breath in confidence of heaven's applause
this is the happy warrior; this is he
that every man in arms should wish to be
half a league, half a league
half a league onward

noble six hundred
october 19, 1864
up from the south at break of day
bringing to winchester fresh dismay
the affrighted air with a shudder bore
like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door
the terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar
telling the battle was on once more
and sheridan--twenty miles away
and wider still those billows of war
thundered along the horizon's bar
and louder yet into winchester rolled
the roar of that red sea uncontrolled
making the blood of the listener cold
as he thought of the stake in that fiery fray
and sheridan--twenty miles away
but there is a road from winchester town
a good broad highway leading down
and there, through the flush of the morning light
a steed, as black as the steeds of night
was seen to pass, as with eagle flight
as if he knew the terrible need
he stretched away with the utmost speed
hills rose and fell--but his heart was gay
with sheridan fifteen miles away
still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering south
the dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth
or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster
foreboding to foemen the doom of disaster
the heart of the steed and the heart of the master
were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls
impatient to be where the battle-field calls
every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
with sheridan only ten miles away
under his spurning feet the road
like an arrowy alpine river flowed
and the landscape sped away behind
like an ocean flying before the wind
and the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire
swept on, with his wild eyes full of fire
but lo! he is nearing his heart's desire
he is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray
with sheridan only five miles away
the first that the general saw were the groups
of stragglers, and then the retreating troops
what was done? what to do? a glance told him both
then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath
he dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzas
and the wave of retreat checked its course there, because
the sight of the master compelled it to pause
with foam and with dust the black charger was gray
by the flash of his eye and the red nostril's play
he seemed to the whole great army to say
from winchester down to save the day
hurrah, hurrah for sheridan
hurrah, hurrah for horse and man
and when their statues are placed on high
under the dome of the union sky
the american soldier's temple of fame
there, with the glorious general's name
be it said in letters both bold and bright
by carrying sheridan into the fight
from winchester--twenty miles away
o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee to-night
for christ is born of mary
and, gathered all above
while mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
o morning stars, together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
how silently, how silently
the wondrous gift is given
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still
the dear christ enters in
o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us, we pray
cast out our sin, and enter in
be born in us to-day
we hear the christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell
oh, come to us, abide with us
our lord emmanuel
this is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign
sails the unshadowed main
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings
and coral reefs lie bare
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair
its webs of living gauze no more unfurl
wrecked is the ship of pearl
and every chambered cell
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell
before thee lies revealed
its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed
year after year beheld the silent toil
that spread his lustrous coil
still, as the spiral grew
he left the past year's dwelling for the new
stole with soft step its shining archway through
built up its idle door
stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more
thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee
child of the wandering sea
cast from her lap, forlorn
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreathed horn
while on mine ear it rings
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings
build thee more stately mansions, o my soul
as the swift seasons roll
leave thy low-vaulted past
let each new temple, nobler than the last
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea
true worth is in _being_, not _seeming
in doing, each day that goes by
some little good--not in dreaming
of great things to do by and by
for whatever men say in their blindness
and spite of the fancies of youth
there's nothing so kingly as kindness
and nothing so royal as truth
we get back our mete as we measure
we cannot do wrong and feel right
nor can we give pain and gain pleasure
for justice avenges each slight
the air for the wing of the sparrow
the bush for the robin and wren
but alway the path that is narrow
and straight, for the children of men
the heart of its ills to beguile
though he who makes courtship to glory
gives all that he hath for her smile
for when from her heights he has won her
alas! it is only to prove
that nothing's so sacred as honor
and nothing so loyal as love
we cannot make bargains for blisses
nor catch them like fishes in nets
and sometimes the thing our life misses
helps more than the thing which it gets
for good lieth not in pursuing
nor gaining of great nor of small
but just in the doing, and doing
as we would be done by, is all
through envy, through malice, through hating
against the world, early and late
no jot of our courage abating
our part is to work and to wait
and slight is the sting of his trouble
whose winnings are less than his worth
for he who is honest is noble
whatever his fortunes or birth
who has seen the wind
neither i nor you
but when the leaves hang trembling
the wind is passing through
who has seen the wind
but when the trees bow down their heads
the wind is passing by
the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat
they took some honey, and plenty of money
wrapped up in a five-pound note
the owl looked up to the moon above
and sang to a small guitar
what a beautiful pussy you are
you are
what a beautiful pussy you are
pussy said to the owl, "you elegant fowl
how wonderful sweet you sing
oh, let us be married,--too long we have tarried
but what shall we do for a ring
they sailed away for a year and a day
to the land where the bong-tree grows
and there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
with a ring in the end of his nose
his nose
with a ring in the end of his nose
your ring?" said the piggy, "i will
so they took it away, and were married next day
by the turkey who lives on the hill
they dined upon mince and slices of quince
which they ate with a runcible spoon
and hand in hand on the edge of the sand
they danced by the light of the moon
the moon
they danced by the light of the moon
the frost looked forth one still, clear night
and whispered, "now i shall be out of sight
so through the valley and over the height
in silence i'll take my way
i will not go on like that blustering train
the wind and the snow, the hail and the rain
that make so much bustle and noise in vain
but i'll be as busy as they
so he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest
he lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest
in diamond beads--and over the breast
of the quivering lake he spread
a coat of mail, that it need not fear
the downward point of many a spear
that he hung on its margin, far and near
where a rock could rear its head
he went to the windows of those who slept
and over each pane like a fairy crept
wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped
by the light of the morn were seen
most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees
there were bevies of birds and swarms of bees
there were cities with temples and towers; and these
all pictured in silver sheen
but he did one thing that was hardly fair
he peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
that all had forgotten for him to prepare
i'll bite this basket of fruit," said he
and the glass of water they've left for me
shall 'tchick!' to tell them i'm drinking
heap high the farmer's wintry hoard
heap high the golden corn
no richer gift has autumn poured
from out her lavish horn
let other lands, exulting, glean
the apple from the pine
the orange from its glossy green
the cluster from the vine
we better love the hardy gift
our rugged vales bestow
to cheer us when the storm shall drift
our harvest-fields with snow
through vales of grass and meads of flowers
our plows their furrows made
while on the hills the sun and showers
of changeful april played
we dropped the seed o'er hill and plain
beneath the sun of may
and frightened from our sprouting grain
the robber crows away
all through the long, bright days of june
its leaves grew green and fair
and waved in hot midsummer's noon
its soft and yellow hair
and now, with autumn's moonlit eyes
its harvest time has come
we pluck away the frosted leaves
and bear the treasure home
there, richer than the fabled gift
apollo showered of old
fair hands the broken grain shall sift
and knead its meal of gold
let vapid idlers loll in silk
around their costly board
give us the bowl of samp and milk
by homespun beauty poured
where'er the wide old kitchen hearth
sends up its smoky curls
who will not thank the kindly earth
and bless our farmer girls
then shame on all the proud and vain
whose folly laughs to scorn
the blessing of our hardy grain
our wealth of golden corn
let earth withhold her goodly root
let mildew blight her rye
give to the worm the orchard's fruit
the wheat-field to the fly
but let the good old crop adorn
the hills our fathers trod
still let us, for his golden corn
send up our thanks to god
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days, in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
to serve therewith my maker, and present
my true account, lest he, returning, chide
i fondly ask. but patience, to prevent
that murmur, soon replies, "god doth not need
either man's work or his own gifts. who best
bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. his state
is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest
they also serve who only stand and wait
where the pools are bright and deep
where the gray trout lies asleep
up the river and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me
where the blackbird sings the latest
where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest
where the nestlings chirp and flee
that's the way for billy and me
where the mowers mow the cleanest
where the hay lies thick and greenest
there to trace the homeward bee
that's the way for billy and me
where the hazel bank is steepest
where the shadow falls the deepest
where the clustering nuts fall free
that's the way for billy and me
why the boys should drive away
little sweet maidens from their play
or love to banter and fight so well
that's the thing i never could tell
but this i know, i love to play
through the meadow, among the hay
up the water and o'er the lea
that's the way for billy and me
the leaves are fading and falling
the winds are rough and wild
the birds have ceased their calling
but let me tell you, my child
though day by day, as it closes
doth darker and colder grow
the roots of the bright red roses
will keep alive in the snow
and when the winter is over
the boughs will get new leaves
the quail come back to the clover
and the swallow back to the eaves
there must be rough, cold weather
and winds and rains so wild
not all good things together
come to us here, my child
so, when some dear joy loses
its beauteous summer glow
think how the roots of the roses
are kept alive in the snow
what does little birdie say
in her nest at peep of day
till the little wings are stronger
so she rests a little longer
then she flies away
what does little baby say
in her bed at peep of day
baby says, like little birdie
till the little limbs are stronger
if she sleeps a little longer
baby, too, shall fly away
up the airy mountain
down the rushy glen
we daren't go a-hunting
for fear of little men
wee folk, good folk
trooping all together
green jacket, red cap
and white owl's feather
down along the rocky shore
some make their home
they live on crispy pancakes
of yellow tide foam
some in the reeds
of the black mountain-lake
with frogs for their watch dogs
all night awake
high on the hill-top
the old king sits
he is now so old and gray
he's nigh lost his wits
with a bridge of white mist
columbkill he crosses
on his stately journeys
from slieveleague to rosses
or going up with music
on cold, starry nights
to sup with the queen
of the gay northern lights
by the craggy hillside
through the mosses bare
they have planted thorn trees
for pleasure here and there
is any man so daring
as dig them up in spite
he shall find their sharpest thorns
in his bed at night
up the airy mountain
down the rushy glen
we daren't go a-hunting
for fear of little men
wee folk, good folk
trooping all together
green jacket, red cap
and white owl's feather
great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world
with the wonderful water round you curled
and the wonderful grass upon your breast
world, you are beautifully drest
the wonderful air is over me
and the wonderful wind is shaking the tree
it walks on the water, and whirls the mills
and talks to itself on the top of the hills
you friendly earth, how far do you go
with the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow
with cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles
and people upon you for thousands of miles
ah! you are so great, and i am so small
i hardly can think of you, world, at all
and yet, when i said my prayers today
a whisper within me seemed to say
you can love and think, and the earth can not
be strong
we are not here to play, to dream, to drift
we have hard work to do, and loads to lift
shun not the struggle--face it; 'tis god's gift
be strong
say not, "the days are evil. who's to blame
and fold the hands and acquiesce--oh shame
stand up, speak out, and bravely, in god's name
be strong
it matters not how deep intrenched the wrong
how hard the battle goes, the day how long
faint not--fight on! to-morrow comes the song
when cats run home and light is come
and dew is cold upon the ground
and the far-off stream is dumb
and the whirring sail goes round
and the whirring sail goes round
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits
when merry milkmaids click the latch
and rarely smells the new-mown hay
and the cock hath sung beneath the thatch
twice or thrice his roundelay
twice or thrice his roundelay
alone and warming his five wits
the white owl in the belfry sits
fame, love and fortune on my footsteps wait
cities and fields i walk: i penetrate
deserts and fields remote, and, passing by
hovel and mart and palace, soon or late
i knock unbidden once at every gate
if sleeping, wake: if feasting, rise before
i turn away. it is the hour of fate
and they who follow me reach every state
mortals desire, and conquer every foe
save death; but those who doubt or hesitate
condemned to failure, penury and woe
seek me in vain and uselessly implore
i answer not, and i return no more
they do me wrong who say i come no more
when once i knock and fail to find you in
for every day i stand outside your door
and bid you wake and rise to fight and win
wail not for precious chances passed away
weep not for golden ages on the wane
each night i burn the records of the day
at sunrise every soul is born again
laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped
to vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb
my judgments seal the dead past with its dead
but never bind a moment yet to come
though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep
i lend an arm to all who say: "i can
no shamefac'd outcast ever sank so deep
but yet might rise and be again a man
dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast
dost reel from righteous retribution's blow
then turn from blotted archives of the past
and find the future's pages white as snow
art thou a mourner? rouse thee from thy spell
art thou a sinner? sins may be forgiven
each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell
each night a star to guide thy feet to heaven
sweet and low, sweet and low
wind of the western sea
low, low, breathe and blow
wind of the western sea
over the rolling waters go
come from the dying moon, and blow
blow him again to me
while my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps
sleep and rest, sleep and rest
father will come to thee soon
rest, rest, on mother's breast
father will come to thee soon
father will come to his babe in the nest
silver sails all out of the west
under the silver moon
sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep
blessings on thee, little man
barefoot boy, with cheek of tan
with thy turned-up pantaloons
and thy merry whistled tunes
with thy red lip, redder still
kissed by strawberries on the hill
with the sunshine on thy face
through thy torn brim's jaunty grace
from, my heart i give thee joy
i was once a barefoot boy
prince thou art,--the grown-up man
only is republican
let the million-dollared ride
barefoot, trudging at his side
thou hast more than he can buy
in the reach of ear and eye
outward sunshine, inward joy
blessings on thee, barefoot boy
o for boyhood's painless play
sleep that wakes in laughing day
health that mocks the doctor's rules
knowledge never learned of schools
of the wild bee's morning chase
of the wild-flower's time and place
flight of fowl and habitude
of the tenants of the wood
how the tortoise bears his shell
how the woodchuck digs his cell
and the ground-mole sinks his well
how the robin feeds her young
how the oriole's nest is hung
where the whitest lilies blow
where the freshest berries grow
where the groundnut trails its vine
where the wood-grape's clusters shine
of the black wasp's cunning way
mason of his walls of clay
and the architectural plans
of gray hornet artisans
for, eschewing books and tasks
nature answers all he asks
hand in hand with her he walks
face to face with her he talks
part and parcel of her joy
blessings on the barefoot boy
o for boyhood's time of june
crowding years in one brief moon
when all things i heard or saw
me, their master, waited for
i was rich in flowers and trees
humming-birds and honey-bees
for my sport the squirrel played
plied the snouted mole his spade
for my taste the blackberry cone
purpled over hedge and stone
laughed the brook for my delight
through the day and through the night
whispering at the garden wall
talked with me from fall to fall
mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond
mine the walnut slopes beyond
mine, on bending orchard trees
apples of hesperides
still as my horizon grew
larger grew my riches too
all the world i saw or knew
seemed a complex chinese toy
fashioned for a barefoot boy
o for festal dainties spread
like my bowl of milk and bread
pewter spoon and bowl of wood
on the door-stone, gray and rude
o'er me, like a regal tent
cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent
purple-curtained, fringed with gold
looped in many a wind-swung fold
while for music came the play
of the pied frogs' orchestra
and, to light the noisy choir
lit the fly his lamp of fire
i was monarch: pomp and joy
waited on the barefoot boy
cheerily, then, my little man
live and laugh, as boyhood can
though the flinty slopes be hard
stubble-speared the new-mown sward
every morn shall lead thee through
fresh baptisms of the dew
every evening from thy feet
shall the cool wind kiss the heat
all too soon these feet must hide
in the prison cells of pride
lose the freedom of the sod
like a colt's for work be shod
made to tread the mills of toil
up and down in ceaseless moil
happy if their track be found
never on forbidden ground
happy if they sink not in
quick and treacherous sands of sin
ah! that thou couldst know thy joy
ere it passes, barefoot boy
there,--my blessing with you
and these few precepts in thy memory
see thou character.--give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportion'd thought his act
be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar
the friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. beware
of entrance to a quarrel; but being in
bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear, but few thy voice
take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all: to thine own self be true
and it must follow, as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man
the mountain and the squirrel
had a quarrel
and the former called the latter "little prig
bun replied
but all sorts of things and weather
must be taken in together
to make up a year
and a sphere
and i think it no disgrace
to occupy my place
if i'm not so large as you
and not half as spry
i'll not deny you make
a very pretty squirrel track
talents differ; all is well and wisely put
if i cannot carry forests on my back
neither can you crack a nut
suppose, my little lady
your doll should break her head
could you make it whole by crying
till your eyes and nose are red
and wouldn't it be pleasanter
to treat it as a joke
and say you're glad "'twas dolly's
and not your head that broke
suppose you're dressed for walking
and the rain comes pouring down
will it clear off any sooner
because you scold and frown
and wouldn't it be nicer
for you to smile than pout
and so make sunshine in the house
when there is none without
suppose your task, my little man
is very hard to get
will it make it any easier
for you to sit and fret
and wouldn't it be wiser
than waiting like a dunce
to go to work in earnest
and learn the thing at once
suppose that some boys have a horse
and some a coach and pair
will it tire you less while walking
to say, "it isn't fair
and wouldn't it be nobler
to keep your temper sweet
and in your heart be thankful
you can walk upon your feet
and suppose the world don't please you
nor the way some people do
do you think the whole creation
will be altered just for you
and isn't it, my boy or girl
the wisest, bravest plan
whatever comes, or doesn't come
to do the best you can
i like little pussy
her coat is so warm
and if i don't hurt her
she'll do me no harm
so i'll not pull her tail
nor drive her away
very gently will play
she shall sit by my side
and i'll give her some food
and she'll love me because
i am gentle and good
i'll pat little pussy
and then she will purr
and thus show her thanks
for my kindness to her
i'll not pinch her ears
nor tread on her paw
lest i should provoke her
to use her sharp claw
i never will vex her
nor make her displeased
for pussy don't like
to be worried or teased
over the river and through the wood
to grandfather's house we go
the horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh
through the white and drifted snow
over the river and through the wood
oh, how the wind does blow
it stings the toes
and bites the nose
as over the ground we go
over the river and through the wood
trot fast, my dapple gray
spring over the ground
like a hunting hound
for this is thanksgiving-day
over the river and through the wood
and straight through the barnyard gate
we seem to go
extremely slow
it is so hard to wait
over the river and through the wood
now grandmother's cap i spy
hurrah for the fun
is the pudding done
hurrah for the pumpkin pie
i wandered lonely as a cloud
that floats on high o'er vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host, of golden daffodils
beside the lake, beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze
continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretched in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance
the waves beside them danced; but they
outdid the sparkling waves in glee
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought
for oft, when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils
i've watched you now a full half-hour
self-poised upon that yellow flower
and, little butterfly! indeed
i know not if you sleep or feed
more motionless! and then
how motionless!--not frozen seas
what joy awaits you, when the breeze
hath found you out among the trees
and calls you forth again
this plot of orchard-ground is ours
my trees they are, my sister's flowers
here rest your wings when they are weary
here lodge as in a sanctuary
come often to us, fear no wrong
sit near us on the bough
we'll talk of sunshine and of song
and summer days when we were young
sweet childish days, that were as long
as twenty days are now
thou blossom bright with autumn dew
and colored with the heaven's own blue
that openest when the quiet light
succeeds the keen and frosty night
thou comest not when violets lean
o'er wandering brooks and springs unseen
or columbines, in purple dressed
nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest
thou waitest late and com'st alone
when woods are bare and birds are flown
and frosts and shortening days portend
the aged year is near his end
then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
look through its fringes to the sky
blue--blue--as if that sky let fall
a flower from its cerulean wall
i would that thus, when i shall see
the hour of death draw near to me
hope, blossoming within my heart
may look to heaven as i depart
the outer trenches guarding
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding
the dark redan, in silent scoff
lay, grim and threatening, under
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belched its thunder
there was a pause. a guardsman said
sing while we may, another day
will bring enough of sorrow
they lay along the battery's side
below the smoking cannon
brave hearts, from severn and from clyde
and from the banks of shannon
they sang of love, and not of fame
forgot was britain's glory
each heart recalled a different name
but all sang "annie laurie
voice after voice caught up the song
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem, rich and strong
their battle-eve confession
dear girl, her name he dared not speak
but, as the song grew louder
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder
beyond the darkening ocean burned
the bloody sunset's embers
while the crimean valleys learned
how english love remembers
and once again a fire of hell
rained on the russian quarters
with scream of shot, and burst of shell
and bellowing of the mortars
and irish nora's eyes are dim
for a singer, dumb and gory
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of "annie laurie
sleep, soldiers! still in honored rest
your truth and valor wearing
the bravest are the tenderest
the loving are the daring
she walks in beauty, like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all that's best of dark and bright
meet in her aspect and her eyes
thus mellowed to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies
one shade the more, one ray the less
had half impaired the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens o'er her face
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure, how dear their dwelling-place
and on that cheek, and o'er that brow
so soft, so calm, yet eloquent
the smiles that win, the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent
a mind at peace with all below
a heart whose love is innocent
all are architects of fate
working in these walls of time
some with massive deeds and great
some with ornaments of rhyme
nothing useless is, or low
each thing in its place is best
and what seems but idle show
strengthens and supports the rest
for the structure that we raise
time is with materials filled
our to-days and yesterdays
are the blocks with which we build
truly shape and fashion these
leave no yawning gaps between
think not, because no man sees
such things will remain unseen
in the elder days of art
builders wrought with greatest care
each minute and unseen part
for the gods see everywhere
let us do our work as well
both the unseen and the seen
make the house, where gods may dwell
beautiful, entire, and clean
else our lives are incomplete
standing in these walls of time
broken stairways, where the feet
stumble as they seek to climb
build to-day, then, strong and sure
with a firm and ample base
and ascending and secure
shall to-morrow find its place
thus alone can we attain
to those turrets, where the eye
sees the world as one vast plain
and one boundless reach of sky
there's a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree
he's singing to me! he's singing to me
and what does he say, little girl, little boy
don't you hear? don't you see
hush! look! in my tree
i'm as happy as happy can be
and the brown thrush keeps singing, "a nest do you see
and five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree
don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy
or the world will lose some of its joy
now i'm glad! now i'm free
and i always shall be
if you never bring sorrow to me
so the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree
to you and to me, to you and to me
and he sings all the day, little girl, little boy
but long it won't be
don't you know? don't you see
unless we are as good as can be
the quality of mercy is not strain'd
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath. it is twice bless'd
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
the throned monarch better than his crown
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
the attribute to awe and majesty
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
but mercy is above this sceptred sway
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
it is an attribute to god himself
and earthly power doth then show likest god's
when mercy seasons justice. therefore, jew
though justice be thy plea, consider this
that, in the course of justice, none of us
should see salvation: we do pray for mercy
and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
the deeds of mercy
if you've tried and have not won
never stop for crying
all's that's great and good is done
just by patient trying
though young birds, in flying, fall
still their wings grow stronger
and the next time they can keep
up a little longer
though the sturdy oak has known
many a blast that bowed her
she has risen again, and grown
loftier and prouder
if by easy work you beat
who the more will prize you
gaining victory from defeat
that's the test that tries you
you know we french stormed ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms locked behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind
just as perhaps he mused, "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army-leader lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reached the mound
then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you looked twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two
we've got you ratisbon
the marshall's in the market-place
and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans
where i, to heart's desire
perched him!" the chief's eye flashed; his plans
soared up again like fire
the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes
a film the mother-eagle's eye
when her bruised eaglet breathes
touched to the quick, he said
smiling, the boy fell dead
the splendor falls on castle walls
and snowy summits old in story
the long light shakes across the lakes
and the wild cataract leaps in glory
blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying
o hark, o hear! how thin and clear
and thinner, clearer, farther going
the horns of elfland faintly blowing
blow, let us hear the purple glens replying
blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying
o love, they die in yon rich sky
they faint on hill or field or river
our echoes roll from soul to soul
and grow for ever and for ever
blow bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying
and answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying
they say that god lives very high
but if you look above the pines
you cannot see our god; and why
and if you dig down in the mines
you never see him in the gold
though from him all that's glory shines
god is so good, he wears a fold
of heaven and earth across his face
like secrets kept for love untold
but still i feel that his embrace
slides down by thrills through all things made
through sight and sound of every place
as if my tender mother laid
on my shut lips her kisses' pressure
half waking me at night, and said
by the flow of the inland river
where the fleets of iron have fled
where the blades of grave grass quiver
asleep are the ranks of the dead
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the one, the blue
under the other, the gray
these in the robings of glory
those in the gloom of defeat
all, with the battle blood gory
in the dusk of eternity meet
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the laurel, the blue
under the willow, the gray
from the silence of sorrowful hours
the desolate mourners go
lovingly laden with flowers
alike for the friend and the foe
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the roses, the blue
under the lilies, the gray
so with an equal splendor
the morning sun-rays fall
with a touch impartially tender
on the blossoms blooming for all
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
mellowed with gold, the gray
so, when the summer calleth
on forest and field of grain
with an equal murmur falleth
the cooling drip of the rain
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
wet with the rain, the blue
wet with the rain, the gray
sadly, but not with upbraiding
the generous deed was done
in the storm of the years that are fading
no braver battle was won
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
under the blossoms, the blue
under the garlands, the gray
no more shall the war-cry sever
or the winding rivers be red
they banish our anger forever
when they laurel the graves of our dead
under the sod and the dew
waiting the judgment day
love and tears for the blue
tears and love for the gray
a fair little girl sat under a tree
sewing as long as her eyes could see
then smoothed her work, and folded it right
and said, "dear work, good night, good night
such a number of rooks came over her head
crying "caw, caw," on their way to bed
she said, as she watched their curious flight
the horses neighed, and the oxen lowed
the sheep's "bleat, bleat" came over the road
and all seemed to say, with a quiet delight
she did not say to the sun "good night
tho' she saw him there like a ball of light
for she knew he had god's own time to keep
all over the world, and never could sleep
the tall pink foxglove bowed his head
the violets curtseyed and went to bed
and good little lucy tied up her hair
and said, on her knees, her favorite prayer
and, while on her pillow she softly lay
she knew nothing more till again it was day
and all things said to the beautiful sun
resting to sleep
why look so pale and so sad, as for ever
wishing to weep
you are too bold
i must obey my dear father above me
and do as i'm told
breathes there the man with soul so dead
who never to himself hath said
this is my own, my native land
whose heart hath ne'er within him burned
as home his footsteps he hath turned
from wandering on a foreign strand
if such there breathe, go, mark him well
for him no minstrel raptures swell
high though his titles, proud his name
boundless his wealth as wish can claim
despite those titles, power, and pelf
the wretch, concentred all in self
living, shall forfeit fair renown
and, doubly dying, shall go down
to the vile dust from whence he sprung
unwept, unhonored and unsung
the year's at the spring
and day's at the morn
morning's at seven
the hillside's dew-pearled
the lark's on the wing
the snail's on the thorn
god's in his heaven
all's right with the world
twinkle, twinkle, little star
how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
when the glorious sun is set
when the grass with dew is wet
then you show your little light
twinkle, twinkle, all the night
in the dark blue sky you keep
and often through my curtains peep
for you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky
as your bright and tiny spark
lights the traveler in the dark
though i know not what you are
twinkle, twinkle, little star
sunset and evening star
and one clear call for me
and may there be no moaning of the bar
when i put out to sea
but such a tide as moving seems asleep
too full for sound and foam
when that which drew from out the boundless deep
turns again home
twilight and evening bell
and after that the dark
and may there be no sadness of farewell
when i embark
for tho' from out our bourne of time and place
the flood may bear me far
i hope to see my pilot face to face
when i have crost the bar
the tree's early leaf buds were bursting their brown
till the blossoms have grown
prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown
the tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung
till the blossoms have grown
said the tree, while his leaflets quivering hung
the tree bore his fruit in the midsummer glow
said the child, "may i gather thy berries now
take them; all are for thee
said the tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low
into the sunshine
full of the light
leaping and flashing
from morn till night
into the moonlight
whiter than snow
waving so flower-like
when the winds blow
into the starlight
rushing in spray
happy at midnight
happy by day
ever in motion
blithesome and cheery
still climbing heavenward
never aweary
glad of all weathers
still seeming best
upward or downward
motion thy rest
full of a nature
nothing can tame
changed every moment
ever the same
ceaseless aspiring
ceaseless content
darkness or sunshine
thy element
glorious fountain
let my heart be
fresh, changeful, constant
upward, like thee
the good dame looked from her cottage
at the close of the pleasant day
and cheerily called to her little son
outside the door at play
while there is light to see
to the hut of the blind old man who lives
across the dike, for me
and take these cakes i made for him
they are hot and smoking yet
you have time enough to go and come
before the sun is set
then the good-wife turned to her labor
humming a simple song
and thought of her husband, working hard
at the sluices all day long
and set the turf a-blazing
and brought the coarse black bread
that he might find a fire at night
and find the table spread
and peter left the brother
with whom all day he had played
and the sister who had watched their sports
in the willow's tender shade
and told them they'd see him back before
they saw a star in sight
though he wouldn't be afraid to go
in the very darkest night
for he was a brave, bright fellow
with eye and conscience clear
he could do whatever a boy might do
and he had not learned to fear
why, he wouldn't have robbed a bird's nest
nor brought a stork to harm
though never a law in holland
had stood to stay his arm
and now with his face all glowing
and eyes as bright as the day
with the thoughts of his pleasant errand
he trudged along the way
and soon his joyous prattle
made glad a lonesome place
alas! if only the blind old man
could have seen that happy face
yet he somehow caught the brightness
which his voice and presence lent
and he felt the sunshine come and go
as peter came and went
and now, as the day was sinking
and the winds began to rise
the mother looked from her door again
shading her anxious eyes
and saw the shadows deepen
and birds to their homes come back
but never a sign of peter
along the level track
but she said, "he will come at morning
so i need not fret nor grieve
though it isn't like my boy at all
to stay without my leave
but where was the child delaying
on the homeward way was he
across the dike while the sun was up
an hour above the sea
he was stopping now to gather flowers
now listening to the sound
as the angry waters dashed themselves
against their narrow bound
and my father tends them carefully
or they would not hold you long
you're a wicked sea," said peter
you would like to spoil our lands and homes
but our sluices keep you safe
but hark! through the noise of waters
comes a low, clear, trickling sound
and the child's face pales with terror
and his blossoms drop to the ground
he is up the bank in a moment
and, stealing through the sand
he sees a stream not yet so large
as his slender, childish hand
unused to fearful scenes
but, young as he is, he has learned to know
the dreadful thing that means
a leak in the dike! the stoutest heart
grows faint that cry to hear
and the bravest man in all the land
turns white with mortal fear
for he knows the smallest leak may grow
to a flood in a single night
and he knows the strength of the cruel sea
when loosed in its angry might
and the boy! he has seen the danger
and shouting a wild alarm
he forces back the weight of the sea
with the strength of his single arm
he listens for the joyful sound
of a footstep passing nigh
and lays his ear to the ground, to catch
the answer to his cry
and he hears the rough winds blowing
and the waters rise and fall
but never an answer comes to him
save the echo of his call
he sees no hope, no succor
his feeble voice is lost
yet what shall he do but watch and wait
though he perish at his post
so, faintly calling and crying
till the sun is under the sea
crying and moaning till the stars
come out for company
he thinks of his brother and sister
asleep in their safe warm bed
he thinks of his father and mother
of himself as dying--and dead
and of how, when the night is over
they must come and find him at last
but he never thinks he can leave the place
where duty holds him fast
the good dame in the cottage
is up and astir with the light
for the thought of her little peter
has been with her all night
and now she watches the pathway
as yester eve she had done
but what does she see so strange and black
against the rising sun
her neighbors are bearing between them
something straight to her door
her child is coming home, but not
as he ever came before
and the startled father hears
and comes and looks the way she looks
and fears the thing she fears
till a glad shout from the bearers
thrills the stricken man and wife
and god has saved his life
so, there in the morning sunshine
they knelt about the boy
and every head was bared and bent
in tearful, reverent joy
when the sea roars like a flood
their boys are taught what a boy can do
who is brave and true and good
for every man in that country
takes his son by the hand
and tells him of little peter
whose courage saved the land
they have many a valiant hero
remembered through the years
but never one whose name so oft
is named with loving tears
and his deed shall be sung by the cradle
and told to the child on the knee
so long as the dikes of holland
divide the land from the sea
merrily swinging on briar and weed
near to the nest of his little dame
over the mountain-side or mead
robert of lincoln is telling his name
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
snug and safe is that nest of ours
hidden among the summer flowers
chee, chee, chee
robert of lincoln is gaily drest
wearing a bright black wedding coat
white are his shoulders and white his crest
hear him call in his merry note
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
look, what a nice new coat is mine
sure there was never a bird so fine
chee, chee, chee
robert of lincoln's quaker wife
pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings
passing at home a patient life
broods in the grass while her husband sings
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
brood, kind creature; you need not fear
thieves and robbers while i am here
chee, chee, chee
modest and shy as a nun is she
one weak chirp is her only note
braggart and prince of braggarts is he
pouring boasts from his little throat
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
never was i afraid of man
catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can
chee, chee, chee
six white eggs on a bed of hay
flecked with purple, a pretty sight
there as the mother sits all day
robert is singing with all his might
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
nice, good wife, that never goes out
keeping the house while i frolic about
chee, chee, chee
soon as the little ones chip the shell
six wide mouths are open for food
robert of lincoln bestirs him well
gathering seeds for the hungry brood
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
this new life is likely to be
hard for a gay young fellow like me
chee, chee, chee
robert of lincoln at length is made
sober with work, and silent with care
off is his holiday garment laid
half forgotten that merry air
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
where our nest and our nestlings lie
chee, chee, chee
summer wanes; the children are grown
fun and frolic no more he knows
robert of lincoln's a humdrum crone
off he flies, and we sing as he goes
bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link
spink, spank, spink
when you can pipe that merry old strain
robert of lincoln, come back again
chee, chee, chee
ring-ting! i wish i were a primrose
a bright yellow primrose, blowing in the spring
the stooping boughs above me
the wandering bee to love me
the fern and moss to creep across
and the elm tree for our king
nay--stay! i wish i were an elm tree
a great, lofty elm tree, with green leaves gay
the winds would set them dancing
the sun and moonshine glance in
the birds would house among the boughs
and sweetly sing
oh no! i wish i were a robin
a robin or a little wren, everywhere to go
through forest, field, or garden
and ask no leave or pardon
till winter comes with icy thumbs
to ruffle up our wing
well--tell! where should i fly to
where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell
before a day was over
home comes the rover
for mother's kiss--sweeter this
than any other thing
not a drum was heard, not a funeral note
as his corse to the rampart we hurried
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried
we buried him darkly at dead of night
the sods with our bayonets turning
by struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning
no useless coffin enclosed his breast
nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest
with his martial cloak around him
few and short were the prayers we said
and we spoke not a word of sorrow
but we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead
and we bitterly thought of the morrow
we thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed
and smoothed down his lonely pillow
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
and we far away on the billow
lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him
but little he'll reck; if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him
but half of our heavy task was done
when the clock tolled the hour for retiring
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing
slowly and sadly we laid him down
from the field of his fame fresh and gory
we carved not a line, and we raised not a stone
but we left him alone with his glory
how many seconds in a minute
sixty, and no more in it
how many minutes in an hour
sixty for sun and shower
how many hours in a day
twenty-four for work and play
how many days in a week
seven both to hear and speak
how many weeks in a month
four, as the swift moon runn'th
how many months in a year
twelve, the almanack makes clear
how many years in an age
one hundred, says the sage
how many ages in time
no one knows the rhyme
here hath been dawning another blue day
think, wilt thou let it slip useless away
out of eternity this new day was born
into eternity, at night, will return
behold it aforetime no eye ever did
so soon it forever from all eyes is hid
here hath been dawning another blue day
think, wilt thou let it slip useless away
said the wind to the moon, "i will blow you out
you stare
in the air
like a ghost in a chair
always looking what i am about
i hate to be watched--i will blow you out
the wind blew hard, and out went the moon
so deep
on a heap
of clouds, to sleep
down lay the wind, and slumbered soon
muttering low, "i've done for that moon
he turned in his bed; she was there again
on high
in the sky
with her one clear eye
the moon shone white and alive and plain
said the wind--"i will blow you out again
the wind blew hard, and the moon grew dim
and my wedge
i have knocked off her edge
if only i blow right fierce and grim
the creature will soon be dimmer than dim
he blew and blew, and she thinned to a thread
more's enough
to blow her to snuff
one good puff more where the last was bred
and glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread
he blew a great blast, and the thread was gone
in the air
nowhere
was a moonbeam bare
far off and harmless the shy stars shone
sure and certain the moon was gone
the wind, he took to his revels once more
on down
in town
like a merry-mad clown
he leaped and halloed with whistle and roar
he flew in a rage--he danced and blew
but in vain
was the pain
of his bursting brain
for still the broader the moon-scrap grew
the broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew
slowly she grew--till she filled the night
and shone
on her throne
in the sky alone
a matchless, wonderful, silvery light
radiant and lovely, the queen of the night
with my breath
good faith
i blew her to death
first blew her away right out of the sky
but the moon, she knew nothing about the affair
for, high
in the sky
with her one white eye
motionless, miles above the air
she had never heard the great wind blare
in the heart of a seed
buried deep, so deep
a dear little plant
lay fast asleep
of the raindrop bright
the little plant heard
and it rose to see
what the wonderful
outside world might be
listen, my children, and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the eighteenth of april, in seventy-five
hardly a man is now alive
who remembers that famous day and year
he said to his friend, "if the british march
by land or sea from the town tonight
hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
of the north church tower, as a signal light
one, if by land, and two, if by sea
and i on the opposite shore will be
ready to ride and spread the alarm
through every middlesex village and farm
for the country folk to be up and to arm
then he said, "good-night"; and with muffled oar
silently rowed to the charlestown shore
just as the moon rose over the bay
where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay
the somerset, british man-of-war
a phantom ship, with each mast and spar
across the moon like a prison bar
and a huge black hulk, that was magnified
by its own reflection in the tide
meanwhile, his friend through alley and street
wanders and watches with eager ears
till, in the silence around him, he hears
the muster of men at the barrack door
the sound of arms, and the tramp of feet
and the measured tread of the grenadiers
marching down to their boats on the shore
then he climbed to the tower of the old north church
by the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread
to the belfry chamber overhead
and startled the pigeons from their perch
on the sombre rafters, that round him made
masses and moving shapes of shade
by the trembling ladder, steep and tall
to the highest window in the wall
where he paused to listen, and look down
a moment on the roofs of the town
and the moonlight flowing over all
beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear, like a sentinel's tread
the watchful night wind, as it went
creeping along from tent to tent
and seeming to whisper, "all is well
a moment only he feels the spell
of the place and hour, and the secret dread
of the lonely belfry and the dead
for suddenly all his thoughts are bent
on a shadowy something far away
where the river widens to meet the bay
a line of black, that bends and floats
on the rising tide, like a bridge of boats
meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride
booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
on the opposite shore walked paul revere
now he patted his horse's side
now gazed on the landscape far and near
then impetuous stamped the earth
and turned and tightened his saddle girth
but mostly he watched with eager search
the belfry tower of the old north church
as it rose above the graves on the hill
lonely and spectral, and sombre and still
and lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
a glimmer, and then a gleam of light
he springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns
but lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
a second lamp in the belfry burns
a harry of hoofs in a village street
a shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark
and beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet
that was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light
the fate of a nation was riding that night
and the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight
kindled the land into flame with its heat
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep
is the mystic, meeting the ocean tides
and under the alders, that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge
is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides
it was twelve by the village clock
when he crossed the bridge into medford town
he heard the crowing of the cock
and the barking of the farmer's dog
and felt the damp of the river fog
that rises after the sun goes down
it was one by the village clock
when he galloped into lexington
he saw the gilded weathercock
swim in the moonlight as he passed
and the meeting house windows, blank and bare
gaze at him with a spectral glare
as if they already stood aghast
at the bloody work they would look upon
it was two by the village clock
when he came to the bridge in concord town
he heard the bleating of the flock
and the twittering of birds among the trees
and felt the breath of the morning breeze
blowing over the meadows brown
and one was safe and asleep in his bed
who at the bridge would be first to fall
who that day would be lying dead
pierced by a british musket ball
you know the rest. in the books you have read
how the british regulars fired and fled
how the farmers gave them ball for ball
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the red coats down the lane
then crossing the fields to emerge again
under the trees at the turn of the road
and only pausing to fire and load
so through the night rode paul revere
and so through the night went his cry of alarm
to every middlesex village and farm
a cry of defiance, and not of fear
a voice in the darkness, a knock at the door
and a word that shall echo forever-more
for borne on the night wind of the past
through all our history to the last
in the hour of darkness and peril and need
the people will waken and listen to hear
the hurrying hoof beats of that steed
and the midnight message of paul revere
in flanders fields the poppies grow
between the crosses, row on row
that mark our place; and in the sky
the larks, still bravely singing, fly
scarce heard amid the guns below
we are the dead. short days ago
we lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
loved and were loved; and now we lie
in flanders fields
take up our quarrel with the foe
to you, from failing hands, we throw
the torch. be yours to hold it high
if ye break faith with us who die
we shall not sleep, though poppies blow
in flanders fields
in flanders fields the cannon boom
and fitful flashes light the gloom
while up above, like eagles, fly
the fierce destroyers of the sky
with stains the earth wherein you lie
is redder than the poppy bloom
in flanders fields
sleep on, ye brave. the shrieking shell
the quaking trench, the startled yell
the fury of the battle hell
shall wake you not; for all is well
sleep peacefully; for all is well
your flaming torch aloft we bear
with burning heart an oath we swear
to keep the faith, to fight it through
to crush the foe, or sleep with you
in flanders fields
the little toy dog is covered with dust
but sturdy and stanch he stands
and the little toy soldier is red with rust
and his musket moulds in his hands
time was when the little toy dog was new
and the soldier was passing fair
and that was the time when our little boy blue
kissed them and put them there
so toddling off to his trundle-bed
he dreamt of the pretty toys
and as he was dreaming, an angel song
awakened our little boy blue
oh, the years are many, the years are long
but the little toy friends are true
ay, faithful to little boy blue they stand
each in the same old place
awaiting the touch of a little hand
the smile of a little face
and they wonder, as waiting these long years through
in the dust of that little chair
what has become of our little boy blue
since he kissed them and put them there
to him who in the love of nature holds
communion with her visible forms, she speaks
a various language; for his gayer hours
she has a voice of gladness, and a smile
and eloquence of beauty, and she glides
into his darker musings with a mild
and healing sympathy, that steals away
their sharpness, ere he is aware. when thoughts
of the last bitter hoar come like a blight
over thy spirit, and sad images
of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall
and breathless darkness, and the narrow house
make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart
go forth, under the open sky, and list
to nature's teachings, while from all around
earth and her waters, and the depths of air
comes a still voice--yet a few days, and thee
the all-beholding sun shall see no more
in all his course; nor yet in the cold ground
where thy pale form was laid with many tears
nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
thy image. earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
thy growth, to be resolved to earth again
and, lost each human trace, surrendering up
thine individual being, shalt thou go
to mix forever with the elements
to be a brother to the insensible rock
and to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
turns with his share, and treads upon. the oak
shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould
yet not to thine eternal resting-place
shalt thou retire alone--nor couldst thou wish
couch more magnificent. thou shalt lie down
with patriarchs of the infant world--with kings
the powerful of the earth--the wise, the good
fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past
all in one mighty sepulchre. the hills
rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun,--the vales
stretching in pensive quietness between
the venerable woods--rivers that move
in majesty, and the complaining brooks
that make the meadows green; and, poured round all
old ocean's gray and melancholy waste
are but the solemn decorations all
of the great tomb of man. the golden sun
the planets, all the infinite host of heaven
are shining on the sad abodes of death
through the still lapse of ages. all that tread
the globe are but a handful to the tribes
that slumber in its bosom. take the wings
of morning, pierce the barcan wilderness
or lose thyself in the continuous woods
where rolls the oregon, and hears no sound
save his own dashings--yet, the dead are there
and millions in those solitudes, since first
the flight of years began, have laid them down
in their last sleep--the dead reign there alone
so shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
in silence from the living, and no friend
take note of thy departure? all that breathe
will share thy destiny. the gay will laugh
when thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
plod on, and each one as before will chase
his favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
their mirth and their employments, and shall come
and make their bed with thee. as the long train
of ages glide away, the sons of men
the youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
in the full strength of years, matron, and maid
and the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man
shall one by one be gathered to thy side
by those who in their turn shall follow them
so live, that when thy summons comes to join
the innumerable caravan which moves
to the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
his chamber in the silent halls of death
thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night
scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
by an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
about him, and lies down to pleasant dreams
it ain't the funniest thing a man can do
existing in a country when it's new
nature, who moved in first--a good long while
has things already somewhat her own style
and she don't want her woodland splendors battered
her rustic furniture broke up and scattered
her paintings, which long years ago were done
by that old splendid artist-king, the sun
torn down and dragged in civilization's gutter
or sold to purchase settlers' bread and butter
she don't want things exposed from porch to closet
and so she kind o' nags the man who does it
she carries in her pockets bags of seeds
as general agent of the thriftiest weeds
she sends her blackbirds, in the early morn
to superintend his fields of planted corn
she gives him rain past any duck's desire
then maybe several weeks of quiet fire
she sails mosquitoes--leeches perched on wings
to poison him with blood-devouring stings
she loves her ague-muscle to display
and shake him up--say every other day
with, thoughtful, conscientious care she makes
those travelin' poison-bottles, rattlesnakes
she finds time, 'mongst her other family cares
to keep in stock good wild-cats, wolves, and bears
well, when i first infested this retreat
things to my view looked frightful incomplete
but i had come with heart-thrift in my song
and brought my wife and plunder right along
i hadn't a round trip ticket to go back
and if i had there wasn't no railroad track
and drivin' east was what i couldn't endure
i hadn't started on a circular tour
my girl-wife was as brave as she was good
and helped me every blessed way she could
she seemed to take to every rough old tree
as sing'lar as when first she took to me
she kep' our little log-house neat as wax
and once i caught her fooling with my axe
she learned a hundred masculine things to do
she aimed a shot-gun pretty middlin' true
although in spite of my express desire
she always shut her eyes before she'd fire
she hadn't the muscle (though she _had_ the heart
in out-door work to take an active part
though in our firm of duty and endeavor
she wasn't no silent partner whatsoever
when i was logging, burning, choppin' wood
she'd linger round and help me all she could
and keep me fresh-ambitious all the while
and lifted tons just with her voice and smile
with no desire my glory for to rob
she used to stan' around and boss the job
and when first-class success my hands befell
would proudly say, "_we_ did that pretty well
she _was_ delicious, both to hear and see
that pretty wife-girl that kep' house for me
well, neighborhoods meant counties in those days
the roads didn't have accommodating ways
and maybe weeks would pass before she'd see
and much less talk with--any one but me
the indians sometimes showed their sun-baked faces
but they didn't teem with conversational graces
some ideas from the birds and trees she stole
but 'twasn't like talking with a human soul
and finally i thought that i could trace
a half heart-hunger peering from her face
then she would drive it back and shut the door
of course that only made me see it more
making a steady effort not to pine
and recognize the seeds of sorrow in it
no misery makes a close observer mourn
like hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne
there's nothing sets the sympathies to paining
like a complaining woman uncomplaining
it always draws my breath out into sighs
to see a brave look in a woman's eyes
well, she went on, as plucky as could be
fighting the foe she thought i did not see
and using her heart-horticultural powers
to turn that forest to a bed of flowers
you cannot check an unadmitted sigh
and so i had to soothe her on the sly
and secretly to help her draw her load
and soon it came to be an up-hill road
hard work bears hard upon the average pulse
even with satisfactory results
but when effects are scarce, the heavy strain
falls dead and solid on the heart and brain
and when we're bothered, it will oft occur
we seek blame-timber; and i lit on her
and looked at her with daily lessening favor
for what i knew she couldn't help, to save her
and discord, when he once had called and seen us
came round quite often, and edged in between us
one night, when i came home unusual late
too hungry and too tired to feel first-rate
her supper struck me wrong (though i'll allow
she hadn't much to strike with, anyhow
and when i went to milk the cows, and found
they'd wandered from their usual feeding ground
and maybe'd left a few long miles behind 'em
which i must copy, if i meant to find 'em
flash-quick the stay-chains of my temper broke
and in a, trice these hot words i had spoke
and drove 'em in; you'd nothing else to do
the heft of all our life on me must fall
you just lie round and let me do it all
that speech--it hadn't been gone a half a minute
before i saw the cold black poison in it
and i'd have given all i had, and more
to've only safely got it back in-door
i'm now what most folks "well-to-do" would call
i feel to-day as if i'd give it all
provided i through fifty years might reach
and kill and bury that half-minute speech
she handed back no words, as i could hear
she didn't frown; she didn't shed a tear
half proud, half crushed, she stood and looked me o'er
like some one she had never seen before
but such a sudden anguish-lit surprise
i never viewed before in human eyes
it sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream
next morning, when, stone-faced, but heavy-hearted
with dinner pail and sharpened axe i started
away for my day's work--she watched the door
and followed me half way to it or more
and i was just a-turning round at this
and asking for my usual good-by kiss
but on her lip i saw a proudish curve
and in her eye a shadow of reserve
and she had shown--perhaps half unawares
some little independent breakfast airs
and so the usual parting didn't occur
although her eyes invited me to her
or rather half invited me, for she
didn't advertise to furnish kisses free
you always had--that is, i had--to pay
full market price, and go more'n half the way
so, with a short "good-by," i shut the door
and left her as i never had before
but when at noon my lunch i came to eat
put up by her so delicately neat
choicer, somewhat, than yesterday's had been
and some fresh, sweet-eyed pansies she'd put in
it seemed as if her kiss with me she'd sent
then i became once more her humble lover
and said, "to-night i'll ask forgiveness of her
i went home over-early on that eve
having contrived to make myself believe
by various signs i kind o' knew and guessed
a thunder-storm was coming from the west
how many honest ones will take its part
a dozen first-class reasons said 'twas right
that i should strike home early on that night
half out of breath, the cabin door i swung
with tender heart-words trembling on my tongue
but all within looked desolate and bare
my house had lost its soul,--she was not there
a penciled note was on the table spread
and these are something like the words it said
i watched them pretty close; don't scold me, dear
and where they are, i think i nearly know
i heard the bell not very long ago
i've hunted for them all the afternoon
i'll try once more--i think i'll find them soon
dear, if a burden i have been to you
and haven't helped you as i ought to do
let old-time memories my forgiveness plead
i've tried to do my best--i have indeed
darling, piece out with love the strength i lack
and have kind words for me when i get back
scarce did i give this letter sight and tongue
some swift-blown rain-drops to the window clung
and from the clouds a rough, deep growl proceeded
my thunder-storm had come, now 'twasn't needed
i rushed out-door. the air was stained with black
night had come early, on the storm-cloud's back
and everything kept dimming to the sight
save when the clouds threw their electric light
when for a flash, so clean-cut was the view
i'd think i saw her--knowing 'twas not true
through my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray
as if the ocean waves had lost their way
scarcely a pause the thunder-battle made
in the bold clamor of its cannonade
and she, while i was sheltered, dry, and warm
was somewhere in the clutches of this storm
she who, when storm-frights found her at her best
had always hid her white face on my breast
my dog, who'd skirmished round me all the day
now crouched and whimpering, in a corner lay
i dragged him by the collar to the wall
i pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl
matched eyes with me, as if to read my mind
then with a yell went tearing through the wood
i followed him, as faithful as i could
no pleasure-trip was that, through flood and flame
we raced with death: we hunted noble game
all night we dragged the woods without avail
the ground got drenched--we could not keep the trail
three times again my cabin home i found
half hoping she might be there, safe and sound
but each time 'twas an unavailing care
my house had lost its soul; she was not there
when, climbing--the wet trees, next morning-sun
laughed at the ruin that the night had done
bleeding and drenched, by toil and sorrow bent
back to what used to be my home i went
but as i neared our little clearing-ground
listen!--i heard the cow-bell's tinkling sound
the cabin door was just a bit ajar
it gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star
she made them guide her homeward through the storm
such pangs of joy i never felt before
yes, she had come--and gone again. she lay
with all her young life crushed and wrenched away
lay, the heart-ruins of oar home among
not far from where i killed her with my tongue
the rain-drops glittered 'mid her hair's long strands
the forest thorns had torn her feet and hands
and 'midst the tears--brave tears--that one could trace
upon the pale but sweetly resolute face
i once again the mournful words could read
and now i'm mostly done; my story's o'er
part of it never breathed the air before
to volunteer heart-history to a crowd
and scatter 'mongst them confidential tears
but you'll protect an old man with his years
and wheresoe'er this story's voice can reach
this is the sermon i would have it preach
boys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds
you can't do that way when you're flying words
thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead
but god himself can't kill them when they're said
yon have my life-grief: do not think a minute
it sheds advice: whoe'er will take and live it
is welcome to the pain it cost to give it
i ain't afeard uv snakes, or toads, or bugs, or worms, or mice
an' things 'at girls are skeered uv i think are awful nice
i'm pretty brave, i guess; an' yet i hate to go to bed
for, when i'm tucked up warm an' snug an' when my prayers are said
mother tells me "happy dreams!" and takes away the light
an' leaves me lying all alone an' seein' things at night
sometimes they're in the corner, sometimes they're by the door
sometimes they're all a-standin' in the middle uv the floor
sometimes they are a-sittin' down, sometimes they're walkin' round
so softly an' so creepylike they never make a sound
sometimes they are as black as ink, an' other times they're white
but the color ain't no difference when you see things at night
once, when i licked a feller 'at had just moved on our street
an' father sent me up to bed without a bite to eat
i woke up in the dark an' saw things standin' in a row
a-lookin' at me cross-eyed an' p'intin' at me--so
oh, my! i was so skeered that time i never slep' a mite
it's almost alluz when i'm bad i see things at night
lucky thing i ain't a girl, or i'd be skeered to death
bein' i'm a boy, i duck my head an' hold my breath
an' i am, oh! so sorry i'm a naughty boy, an' then
i promise to be better an' i say my prayers again
gran'ma tells me that's the only way to make it right
when a feller has been wicked an' sees things at night
an' so, when other naughty boys would coax me into sin
i try to skwush the tempter's voice 'at urges me within
an' when they's pie for supper, or cakes 'at's big an' nice
i want to--but i do not pass my plate f'r them things twice
no, ruther let starvation wipe me slowly out o' sight
than i should keep a-livin' on an' seein' things at night

maud muller, on a summer's day
raked the meadow sweet with hay
beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth
of simple beauty and rustic health
singing, she wrought, and her merry glee
the mock-bird echoed from his tree
but when she glanced to the far-off town
white from its hill-slope looking down
the sweet song died, and a vague unrest
and a nameless longing filled her breast
a wish, that she hardly dared to own
for something better than she had known
the judge rode slowly down the lane
smoothing his horse's chestnut mane
he drew his bridle in the shade
of the apple-trees, to greet the maid
and asked a draught from the spring that flowed
through the meadow across the road
she stooped where the cool spring bubbled up
and filled for him her small tin cup
and blushed as she gave it, looking down
on her feet so bare, and her tattered gown
from a fairer hand was never quaffed
he spoke of the grass and flowers and trees
of the singing birds and the humming' bees
then talked of the haying, and wondered whether
the cloud in the west would bring foul weather
and maud forgot her brier-torn gown
and her graceful ankles bare and brown
and listened, while a pleased surprise
looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes
at last, like one who for delay
seeks a vain excuse, he rode away
maud muller looked and sighed: "ah, me
that i the judge's bride might be
and praise and toast me at his wine
my brother should sail a painted boat
and the baby should have a new toy each day
and all should bless me who left our door
the judge looked back as he climbed the hill
and saw maud muller standing still
ne'er hath it been my lot to meet
show her wise and good as she is fair
like her, a harvester of hay
nor weary lawyers with endless tongues
and health and quiet and loving words
but he thought of his sisters proud and cold
and his mother vain of her rank and gold
so, closing his heart, the judge rode on
and maud was left in the field alone
but the lawyers smiled that afternoon
when he hummed in court an old love-tune
and the young girl mused beside the well
till the rain on the unraked clover fell
he wedded a wife of richest dower
who lived for fashion, as he for power
yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow
he watched a picture come and go
and sweet maud muller's hazel eyes
looked out in their innocent surprise
oft, when the wine in his glass was red
he longed for the wayside well instead
and closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
to dream of meadows and clover-blooms
and the proud man sighed, with a secret pain
where the barefoot maiden raked her hay
she wedded a man unlearned and poor
and many children played round her door
but care and sorrow, and childbirth pain
left their traces on heart and brain
and oft, when the summer sun shone hot
on the new-mown hay in the meadow lot
and she heard the little spring brook fall
over the roadside, through the wall
in the shade of the apple-tree again
she saw a rider draw his rein
and, gazing down with timid grace
she felt his pleased eyes read her face
sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
stretched away into stately halls
the weary wheel to a spinnet turned
the tallow candle an astral burned
and for him who sat by the chimney lug
dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug
a manly form at her side she saw
and joy was duty and love was law
then she took up her burden of life again
saying only, "it might have been
alas for maiden, alas for judge
for rich repiner and household drudge
god pity them both! and pity us all
who vainly the dreams of youth recall
for of all sad words of tongue or pen
the saddest are these: "it might have been
ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies
deeply buried from human eyes
and, in the hereafter, angels may
roll the stone from its grave away
we were hunting for wintergreen berries
one may-day, long gone by
out on the rocky cliff's edge
sister had hair like the sunbeams
black as a crow's wing, mine
sister had blue, dove's eyes
wicked, black eyes are mine
why, see how my eyes are faded
and my hair, it is white as snow
and thin, too! don't you see it is
i tear it sometimes; so
there, don't hold my hands, maggie
i don't feel like tearing it now
but--where was i in my story
oh, i was telling you how
we were looking for wintergreen berries
and the moss-grown rocks were slippery
with the rains of yesterday
but i was cross that morning
though the sun shone ever so bright
and when sister found the most berries
i was angry enough to fight
and when she laughed at my pouting
we were little things, you know
i clinched my little fist up tight
and struck her the biggest blow
i struck her--i tell you--i struck her
and she fell right over below
there, there, maggie, i won't rave now
you needn't hold me so
she went right over, i tell you
down, down to the depths below
there where the waters flow
she fell right over, moaning
that, when i looked down affrighted
it drove me _mad--mad
only her golden hair streaming
out on the rippling wave
only her little hand reaching
up, for someone to save
and she sank down in the darkness
i never saw her again
and this is a chaos of blackness
and darkness and grief since then
no more playing together
down on the pebbly strand
nor building our dolls stone castles
with halls and parlors grand
no more fishing with bent pins
in the little brook's clear waves
no more holding funerals
o'er dead canaries' graves
no more walking together
to the log schoolhouse each morn
no more vexing the master
with putting his rules to scorn
no more feeding of white lambs
with milk from the foaming pail
no more playing "see-saw
over the fence of rail
no more telling of stories
after we've gone to bed
nor talking of ghosts and goblins
till we fairly shiver with dread
no more whispering fearfully
and hugging each other tight
when the shutters shake and the dogs howl
in the middle of the night
no more saying "our father
kneeling by mother's knee
for, maggie, i _struck_ sister
and mother is dead, you see
maggie, sister's an angel
isn't she? isn't it true
for angels have golden tresses
and eyes like sister's, blue
now _my_ hair isn't golden
my eyes aren't blue, you see
now tell me, maggie, if i were to die
could they make an angel of me
you say, "oh, yes"; you think so
well, then, when i come to die
we'll play up there, in god's garden
now, maggie, you needn't eye me
because i'm talking so queer
because i'm talking so strangely
you needn't have the least fear
somehow i'm feeling to-night, maggie
as i never felt before
i'm sure, i'm sure of it, maggie
i never shall rave any more
maggie, you know how these long years
i've heard her calling, so sad
it always drives me _mad
how the winter wind shrieks down the chimney
how the south wind wails at the casement
but most of all when the may-days
come back, with the flowers and the sun
how the night-bird, singing, all lonely
you know how it sets me raving
for _she_ moaned, "_oh, bessie!_" just so
that time i _struck_ little sister
on the may-day long ago
now, maggie, i've something to tell you
you know may-day is here
well, this very morning, at sunrise
the robins chirped "bessie!" so clear
all day long the wee birds singing
perched on the garden wall
called "bessie, oh, bessie!" so sweetly
i couldn't feel sorry at all
now, maggie, i've something to tell you
let me lean up to you close
do you see how the sunset has flooded
the heavens with yellow and rose
do you see o'er the gilded cloud mountains
sister's golden hair streaming out
do you see her little hand beckoning
do you hear her little voice calling out
yes, sister, i'm coming; i'm coming
to play in god's garden at last
it takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it home
a heap o' sun an' shadder, an' ye sometimes have t' roam
afore ye really 'preciate the things ye left behind
an' hunger fer 'em somehow, with 'em allus on yer mind
it don't make any differunce how rich ye get t' be
how much yer chairs an' tables cost, how great yer luxury
it ain't home t' ye, though it be the palace of a king
until somehow yer soul is sort o' wrapped 'round everything
home ain't a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute
afore it's home there's got t' be a heap o' livin' in it
within the walls there's got t' be some babies born, and then
right there ye've got t' bring 'em up t' women good, an' men
and gradjerly, as time goes on ye find ye wouldn't part
with anything they ever used--they've grown into yer heart
the old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore
ye hoard; an' if ye could ye'd keep the thumbmarks on the door
ye've got t' weep t' make it home, ye've got t' sit and sigh
an' watch beside a loved one's bed, an' know that death is nigh
an' in the stillness o' the night t' see death's angel come
an' close the eyes o' her that smiled, an' leave her sweet voice dumb
fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an' when yer tears are dried
ye find the home is dearer than it was, an' sanctified
an' tuggin' at ye always are the pleasant memories
o' her that was an' is no more--ye can't escape from these
ye've got t' sing and dance fer years, ye've got t' romp an' play
an' learn t' love the things ye have by usin' 'em each day
even the roses 'round the porch must blossom year by year
afore they 'come a part o' ye, suggestin' someone dear
who used t' love 'em long ago, an' trained 'em jes' t' run
the way they do, so's they would get the early mornin' sun
ye've got t' love each brick an' stone from cellar up t' dome
it takes a heap o' livin' in a house f' make it home
whenever i walk to suffern along the erie track
i go by a poor old farm-house with its shingles broken and black
i suppose i've passed it a hundred times, but i always stop for a minute
and look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it
i've never seen a haunted house, but i hear there are such things
that they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings
i know that house isn't haunted and i wish it were, i do
for it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two
this house on the road to suffern needs a dozen panes of glass
and somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass
it needs new paint and shingles and vines should be trimmed and tied
but what it needs most of all is some people living inside
if i had a bit of money and all my debts were paid
i'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade
i'd buy that place and fix it up the way that it used to be
and i'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free
now a new home standing empty with staring window and door
looks idle perhaps and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store
but there's nothing mournful about it, it cannot be sad and lone
for the lack of something within it that it has never known
but a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has
sheltered life
that has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife
a house that has echoed a baby's laugh and helped up his stumbling feet
is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet
so whenever i go to suffern along the erie track
i never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back
yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen
apart
for i can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken
heart
like liquid gold the wheat field lies
a marvel of yellow and russet and green
that ripples and runs, that floats and flies
with the subtle shadows, the change, the sheen
that play in the golden hair of a girl
a ripple of amber--a flare
of light sweeping after--a curl
in the hollows like swirling feet
of fairy waltzers, the colors run
to the western sun
through the deeps of the ripening wheat
broad as the fleckless, soaring sky
mysterious, fair as the moon-led sea
the vast plain flames on the dazzled eye
under the fierce sun's alchemy
the slow hawk stoops
to his prey in the deeps
the sunflower droops
to the lazy wave; the wind sleeps
then swirling in dazzling links and loops
a riot of shadow and shine
a glory of olive and amber and wine
to the westering sun the colors run
through the deeps of the ripening wheat
o glorious land! my western land
outspread beneath the setting sun
once more amid your swells, i stand
and cross your sod-lands dry and dun
i hear the jocund calls of men
who sweep amid the ripened grain
with swift, stern reapers; once again
the evening splendor floods the plain
the crickets' chime
makes pauseless rhyme
and toward the sun
the colors run
before the wind's feet
in the wheat
i walked through the woodland meadows
where sweet the thrushes sing
and i found on a bed of mosses
a bird with a broken wing
i healed its wound, and each morning
it sang its old sweet strain
but the bird with a broken pinion
never soared as high again
i found a young life broken
by sin's seductive art
and touched with a christlike pity
i took him to my heart
he lived with a noble purpose
and struggled not in vain
but the life that sin had stricken
never soared as high again
but the bird with a broken pinion
kept another from the snare
and the life that sin had stricken
raised another from despair
each loss has its compensation
there is healing for every pain
but the bird with a broken pinion
never soars as high again
it was in the days when claverhouse
was scouring moor and glen
to change, with fire and bloody sword
the faith of scottish men
they had made a covenant with the lord
firm in their faith to bide
nor break to him their plighted word
whatever might betide
the sun was well-nigh setting
when o'er the heather wild
and up the narrow mountain-path
alone there walked a child
he was a bonny, blithesome lad
sturdy and strong of limb
a father's pride, a mother's love
were fast bound up in him
his bright blue eyes glanced fearless round
his step was firm and light
what was it underneath his plaid
his little hands grasped tight
it was bannocks which, that very morn
his mother made with care
from out her scanty store of meal
and now, with many a prayer
had sent by jamie her ane boy
a trusty lad and brave
to good old pastor tammons roy
now hid in yonder cave
and for whom the bloody claverhouse
had hunted long in vain
and swore they would not leave that glen
till old tam roy was slain
so jamie douglas went his way
with heart that knew no fear
he turned the great curve in the rock
nor dreamed that death was near
and there were bloody claverhouse men
who laughed aloud with glee
when trembling now within their power
the frightened child they see
he turns to flee, but all in vain
they drag him back apace
to where their cruel leader stands
and set them face to face
the cakes concealed beneath his plaid
soon tell the story plain
exclaimed the angry man
and i will let you go
but jamie shook his yellow curls
and stoutly answered--"no
and there upon the stones
the old gaunt wolf and carrion crow
shall battle for your bones
and in his brawny, strong right hand
he lifted up the child
and held him where the clefted rocks
formed a chasm deep and wild
so deep it was, the trees below
like stunted bushes seemed
poor jamie looked in frightened maze
it seemed some horrid dream
he looked up at the blue sky above
then at the men near by
had _they_ no little boys at home
that they could let him die
but no one spoke and no one stirred
or lifted hand to save
from such a fearful, frightful death
the little lad so brave
so drop me down then, if you will
it is nae so deep as hell
a childish scream, a faint, dull sound
oh! jamie douglas true
long, long within that lonely cave
shall tam roy wait for you
long for your welcome coming
waits the mother on the moor
and watches and calls, "come, jamie, lad
through the half-open door
no more adown the rocky path
you come with fearless tread
or, on moor or mountain, take
the good man's daily bread
but up in heaven the shining ones
a wondrous story tell
of a child snatched up from a rocky gulf
that is nae so deep as hell
and there before the great white throne
forever blessed and glad
his mother dear and old tam roy
shall meet their bonny lad
never mind me, uncle jared, never mind my bleeding breast
they are charging in the valley and you're needed with the rest
all the day long from its dawning till you saw your kinsman fall
you have answered fresh and fearless to our brave commander's call
and i would not rob my country of your gallant aid to-night
though your presence and your pity stay my spirit in its flight
all along that quivering column see the death steed trampling down
men whose deeds this day are worthy of a kingdom and a crown
prithee hasten, uncle jared, what's the bullet in my breast
to that murderous storm of fire raining tortures on the rest
see! the bayonets flash and falter--look! the foe begins to win
see! oh, see our falling comrades! god! the ranks are closing in
hark! there's quickening in the distance and a thundering in the air
like the roaring of a lion just emerging from his lair
there's a cloud of something yonder fast unrolling like a scroll
quick! oh, quick! if it be succor that can save the cause a soul
look! a thousand thirsty bayonets are flashing down the vale
and a thousand thirsty riders dashing onward like a gale
raise me higher, uncle jared, place the ensign in my hand
i am strong enough to float it while you cheer that flying band
louder! louder! shout for freedom with prolonged and vigorous breath
shout for liberty and union, and the victory over death
see! they catch the stirring numbers and they swell them to the breeze
cap and plume and starry banner waving proudly through the trees
mark our fainting comrades rally, see that drooping column rise
i can almost see the fire newly kindled in their eyes
fresh for conflict, nerved to conquer, see them charging on the foe
face to face with deadly meaning--shot and shell and trusty blow
see the thinned ranks wildly breaking--see them scatter to the sun
i can die, uncle jared, for the glorious day is won
but there's something, something pressing with a numbness on my heart
and my lips with mortal dumbness fail the burden to impart
oh i tell you, uncle jared, there is something back of all
that a soldier cannot part with when he heeds his country's call
ask the mother what, in dying, sends her yearning spirit back
over life's rough, broken marches, where she's pointed out the track
ask the dear ones gathered nightly round the shining household hearth
what to them is dearer, better, than the brightest things of earth
ask that dearer one whose loving, like a ceaseless vestal flame
sets my very soul a-glowing at the mention of her name
ask her why the loved in dying feels her spirit linked with his
in a union death but strengthens, she will tell you what it is
and there's something, uncle jared, you may tell her if you will
that the precious flag she gave me, i have kept unsullied still
and--this touch of pride forgive me--where death sought our gallant host
where our stricken lines were weakest, there it ever waved the most
bear it back and tell her fondly, brighter, purer, steadier far
but forbear, dear uncle jared, when there's something more to tell
when her lips with rapid blanching bid you answer how i fell
teach your tongue the trick of slighting, though 'tis faithful to the rest
lest it say her brother's bullet is the bullet in my breast
but if it must be that she learn it despite your tenderest care
life is ebbing, uncle jared, my enlistment endeth here
death, the conqueror, has drafted--i can no more volunteer
but i hear the roll call yonder and i go with willing feet
through the shadows of the valley where victorious armies meet
raise the ensign, uncle jared, let its dear folds o'er me fall
strength and union for my country--and god's banner over all
every coin of earthly treasure
we have lavished upon earth
for our simple worldly pleasure
may be reckoned something worth
for the spending was not losing
tho' the purchase were but small
it has perished with the using
we have had it,--that is all
all the gold we leave behind us
when we turn to dust again
tho' our avarice may blind us
we have gathered quite in vain
since we neither can direct it
by the winds of fortune tost
nor in other worlds expect it
what we hoarded we have lost
but each merciful oblation
seed of pity wisely sown
what we gave in self-negation
we may safely call our own
for the treasure freely given
is the treasure that we hoard
since the angels keep in heaven
what is lent unto the lord
whence come those shrieks so wild and shrill
that cut, like blades of steel, the air
causing the creeping blood to chill
with the sharp cadence of despair
again they come, as if a heart
were cleft in twain by one quick blow
and every string had voice apart
to utter its peculiar woe
whence came they? from yon temple, where
an altar, raised for private prayer
now forms the warrior's marble bed
who warsaw's gallant armies led
the dim funereal tapers throw
a holy luster o'er his brow
and burnish with their rays of light
the mass of curls that gather bright
above the haughty brow and eye
of a young boy that's kneeling by
what hand is that, whose icy press
clings to the dead with death's own grasp
but meets no answering caress
no thrilling fingers seek its clasp
it is the hand of her whose cry
rang wildly, late, upon the air
when the dead warrior met her eye
outstretched upon the altar there
with pallid lip and stony brow
she murmurs forth her anguish now
but hark! the tramp of heavy feet
is heard along the bloody street
nearer and nearer yet they come
with clanking arms and noiseless drum
now whispered curses, low and deep
around the holy temple creep
the gate is burst; a ruffian band
rush in, and savagely demand
with brutal voice and oath profane
the startled boy for exile's chain
the mother sprang with gesture wild
and to her bosom clasped her child
then, with pale cheek and flashing eye
shouted with fearful energy
too near the body of my dead
nor touch the living boy; i stand
between him and your lawless band
take _me_, and bind these arms--these hands
with russia's heaviest iron bands
and drag me to siberia's wild
to perish, if 'twill save my child
tearing the pale boy from her side
and in his ruffian grasp he bore
his victim to the temple door
will land or gold redeem my son
take heritage, take name, take all
but leave him free from russian thrall
take these!" and her white arms and hands
she stripped of rings and diamond bands
and tore from braids of long black hair
the gems that gleamed like starlight there
her cross of blazing rubies, last
down at the russian's feet she cast
he stooped to seize the glittering store
up springing from the marble floor
the mother, with a cry of joy
snatched to her leaping heart the boy
but no! the russian's iron grasp
again undid the mother's clasp
forward she fell, with one long cry
of more than mortal agony
but the brave child is roused at length
and, breaking from the russian's hold
he stands, a giant in the strength
of his young spirit, fierce and bold
proudly he towers; his flashing eye
so blue, and yet so bright
seems kindled from the eternal sky
so brilliant is its light
his curling lips and crimson cheeks
foretell the thought before he speaks
with a full voice of proud command
he turned upon the wondering band
this hour has made the boy a man
i knelt before my slaughtered sire
nor felt one throb of vengeful ire
i wept upon his marble brow
yes, wept! i was a child; but now
my noble mother, on her knee
hath done the work of years for me
he drew aside his broidered vest
and there, like slumbering serpent's crest
the jeweled haft of poniard bright
glittered a moment on the sight
think ye my noble father's glaive
would drink the life-blood of a slave
the pearls that on the handle flame
would blush to rubies in their shame
the blade would quiver in thy breast
ashamed of such ignoble rest
no! thus i rend the tyrant's chain
and fling him back a boy's disdain
a moment, and the funeral light
flashed on the jeweled weapon bright
another, and his young heart's blood
leaped to the floor, a crimson flood
quick to his mother's side he sprang
and on the air his clear voice rang
the choice was death or slavery
up, mother, up! look on thy son
his freedom is forever won
and now he waits one holy kiss
to bear his father home in bliss
one last embrace, one blessing,--one
to prove thou knowest, approvest thy son
what! silent yet? canst thou not feel
my warm blood o'er thy heart congeal
speak, mother, speak! lift up thy head
what! silent still? then art thou dead
rejoice with thee,--and thus--to die
one long, deep breath, and his pale head
lay on his mother's bosom,--dead
i wrote some lines once on a time
in wondrous merry mood
and thought, as usual, men would say
they were exceeding good
they were so queer, so very queer
i laughed as i would die
albeit, in the general way
i called my servant, and he came
how kind it was of him
to mind a slender man like me
he of the mighty limb
and, in my humorous way
i added (as a trifling jest
he took the paper, and i watched
and saw him peep within
at the first line he read, his face
was all upon the grin
he read the next; the grin grew broad
and shot from ear to ear
he read the third; a chuckling noise
i now began to hear
the fourth; he broke into a roar
the fifth; his waistband split
the sixth; he burst five buttons off
and tumbled in a fit
ten days and nights, with sleepless eye
i watched that wretched man
and since, i never dare to write
as funny as i can
the shades of night were falling fast
as through an alpine village passed
a youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice
a banner with the strange device
excelsior
his brow was sad his eye beneath
flashed like a falchion from its sheath
and like a silver clarion rung
the accents of that unknown tongue
excelsior
in happy homes he saw the light
of household fires gleam warm and bright
above, the spectral glaciers shone
and from his lips escaped a groan
excelsior
the roaring torrent is deep and wide
and loud the clarion voice replied
excelsior
thy weary head upon this breast
a tear stood in his bright blue eye
but still he answered, with a sigh
excelsior
beware the awful avalanche
this was the peasant's last good-night
a voice replied, far up the height
excelsior
at break of day, as heavenward
the pious monks of saint bernard
uttered the oft-repeated prayer
a voice cried through the startled air
excelsior
a traveller, by the faithful hound
half-buried in the snow was found
still grasping in his hand of ice
that banner with the strange device
excelsior
there in the twilight cold and gray
lifeless, but beautiful, he lay
and from the sky, serene and far
a voice fell, like a falling star
excelsior
the muffled drum's sad roll has beat
the soldier's last tattoo
no more on life's parade shall meet
that brave and fallen few
on fame's eternal camping ground
their silent tents are spread
and glory guards with solemn round
the bivouac of the dead
no rumor of the foe's advance
now swells upon the wind
no troubled thought at midnight haunts
of loved ones left behind
no vision of the morrow's strife
the warrior's dream alarms
no braying horn or screaming fife
at dawn shall call to arms
their shivered swords are red with rust
their plumèd heads are bowed
their haughty banner, trailed in dust
is now their martial shroud
and plenteous funeral tears have washed
the red stains from each brow
and the proud forms, by battle gashed
are free from anguish now
the neighing troop, the flashing blade
the bugle's stirring blast
the charge, the dreadful cannonade
the din and shout are passed
nor war's wild note, nor glory's peal
shall thrill with fierce delight
those breasts that nevermore shall feel
the rapture of the fight
like a fierce northern hurricane
that sweeps his great plateau
flushed with the triumph yet to gain
came down the serried foe
who heard the thunder of the fray
break o'er the field beneath
knew well the watchword of that day
was "victory or death
full many a mother's breath hath swept
o'er angostura's plain
and long the pitying sky hath wept
above its moulder'd slain
the raven's scream, or eagle's flight
or shepherd's pensive lay
alone now wake each solemn height
that frowned o'er that dread fray
sons of the "dark and bloody ground
ye must not slumber there
where stranger steps and tongues resound
along the heedless air
your own proud land's heroic soil
shall be your fitter grave
she claims from war its richest spoil
the ashes of her brave
thus 'neath their parent turf they rest
far from the gory field
borne to a spartan mother's breast
on many a bloody shield
the sunshine of their native sky
smiles sadly on them here
and kindred eyes and hearts watch by
the heroes' sepulcher
rest on, embalmed and sainted dead
dear as the blood ye gave
no impious footsteps here shall tread
the herbage of your grave
nor shall your glory be forgot
while fame her record keeps
or honor points the hallowed spot
where valor proudly sleeps
yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone
in deathless song shall tell
when many a vanished year hath flown
the story how ye fell
nor wreck, nor change, nor winter's blight
nor time's remorseless doom
can dim one ray of holy light
that gilds your glorious tomb
come to me, o ye children
for i hear you at your play
and the questions that perplexed me
have vanished quite away
ye open the eastern windows
that look towards the sun
where thoughts are singing swallows
and the brooks of morning run
in your hearts are the birds and the sunshine
in your thoughts the brooklet's flow
but in mine is the wind of autumn
and the first fall of the snow
ah! what would the world be to us
if the children were no more
we should dread the desert behind us
worse than the dark before
what the leaves are to the forest
with light and air for food
ere their sweet and tender juices
have been hardened into wood
that to the world are children
through them it feels the glow
of a brighter and sunnier climate
than reaches the trunks below
come to me, o ye children
and whisper in my ear
what the birds and the winds are singing
in your sunny atmosphere
for what are all our contrivings
and the wisdom of our books
when compared with your caresses
and the gladness of your looks
ye are better than all the ballads
that ever were sung or said
for ye are living poems
and all the rest are dead
there was a sound of revelry by night
and belgium's capital had gathered then
her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men
a thousand hearts beat happily; and when
music arose with its voluptuous swell
soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again
and all went merry as a marriage bell
but hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell
did ye not hear it?--no; 'twas but the wind
or the car rattling o'er the stony street
on with the dance! let joy be unconfined
no sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet
to chase the glowing hours with flying feet
but, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more
as if the clouds its echo would repeat
and nearer, clearer, deadlier than before
arm! arm! it is--it is the cannon's opening roar
ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro
and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress
and cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
blush'd at the praise of their own loveliness
and there were sudden partings, such as press
the life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
if ever more should meet those mutual eyes
since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise
and there was mounting in hot haste: the steed
the mustering squadron, and the clattering car
went pouring forward with impetuous speed
and swiftly forming in the ranks of war
and the deep thunder, peal on peal afar
and near, the beat of the alarming drum
roused up the soldier ere the morning star
while thronged the citizens with terror dumb
or whispering with white lips, "the foe! they come! they come
last noon beheld them full of lusty life
last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay
the midnight brought the signal sound of strife
the morn the marshaling in arms,--the day
battle's magnificently stern array
the thunder clouds close o'er it, which when rent
the earth is covered thick with other clay
which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent
rider and horse--friend, foe--in one red burial blent
this is the land where hate should die
no feuds of faith, no spleen of race
no darkly brooding fear should try
beneath our flag to find a place
lo! every people here has sent
its sons to answer freedom's call
their lifeblood is the strong cement
that builds and binds the nation's wall
this is the land where hate should die
though dear to me my faith and shrine
respect the creeds that are not mine
he little loves his land who'd cast
upon his neighbor's word a doubt
or cite the wrongs of ages past
from present rights to bar him out
this is the land where hate should die
this is the land where strife should cease
where foul, suspicious fear should fly
before the light of love and peace
then let us purge from poisoned thought
that service to the state we give
and so be worthy as we ought
of this great land in which we live
and its organ was the finest and the biggest in the town
and the chorus--all the papers favorably commented on it
for 'twas said each female member had a forty-dollar bonnet
now in the "amen corner" of the church sat brother eyer
who persisted every sabbath-day in singing with the choir
he was poor but genteel-looking, and his heart as snow was white
and his old face beamed with sweetness when he sang with all his might
his voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords
and nearly every sunday he would mispronounce the words
of the hymns, and 'twas no wonder, he was old and nearly blind
and the choir rattling onward always left him far behind
the chorus stormed and blustered, brother eyer sang too slow
and then he used the tunes in vogue a hundred years ago
at last the storm-cloud burst, and the  church was told, in fine
that the brother must stop singing, or the choir would resign
then the pastor called together in the vestry-room one day
seven influential members who subscribe more than they pay
and having asked god's guidance in a printed pray'r or two
they put their heads together to determine what to do
they debated, thought, suggested, till at last "dear brother york
who last winter made a million on a sudden rise in pork
rose and moved that a committee wait at once on brother eyer
and proceed to rake him lively "for disturbin' of the choir
said he: "in that 'ere organ i've invested quite a pile
and we'll sell it if we cannot worship in the latest style
our philadelphy tenor tells me 'tis the hardest thing
fer to make god understand him when the brother tries to sing
we pay the steepest sal'ry to our pastor, brother brown
but if we must humor ignorance because it's blind and old
if the choir's to be pestered, i will seek another fold
of course the motion carried, and one day a coach and four
with the latest style of driver, rattled up to eyer's door
and the sleek, well-dress'd committee, brothers sharkey, york and lamb
as they crossed the humble portal took good care to miss the jamb
they found the choir's great trouble sitting in his old arm chair
and the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his thin white hair
he was singing "rock of ages" in a cracked voice and low
but the angels understood him, 'twas all he cared to know
said york: "we're here, dear brother, with the vestry's approbation
to discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
that it was to relieve us, that is, do the singing for us
if we rupture the agreement, it is very plain, dear brother
it will leave our congregation and be gobbled by another
the latest tunes are all the rage; the old ones stand for naught
and so we have decided--are you list'ning, brother eyer
that you'll have to stop your singin' for it flurrytates the choir
the old man slowly raised his head, a sign that he did hear
and on his cheek the trio caught the glitter of a tear
his feeble hands pushed back the locks white as the silky snow
as he answered the committee in a voice both sweet and low
i'm sorry i disturb the choir, perhaps i'm doing wrong
but when my heart is filled with praise, i can't keep back a song
in the far-off heav'nly temple, where the master i shall greet
yes, i wonder when i try to sing the songs of god up high'r
if the angel band will church me for disturbing heaven's choir
a silence filled the little room; the old man bowed his head
the carriage rattled on again, but brother eyer was dead
yes, dead! his hand had raised the veil the future hangs before us
and the master dear had called him to the everlasting chorus
the choir missed him for a while, but he was soon forgot
a few church-goers watched the door; the old man entered not
far away, his voice no longer cracked, he sang his heart's desires
where there are no church committees and no fashionable choirs
the sweetest lives are those to duty wed
whose deeds, both great and small
are close knit strands of an unbroken thread
whose love ennobles all
the world may sound no trumpet, ring no bells
the book of life, the shining record tells
thy love shall chant its own beatitudes
after its own life-working. a child's kiss
set on thy singing lips shall make thee glad
a poor man served by thee shall make thee rich
a sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong
thou shalt be served thyself by every sense
of service thou renderest
i saw him once before
as he passed by the door
and again
the pavement stones resound
as he totters o'er the ground
with his cane
they say that in his prime
ere the pruning-knife of time
cut him down
not a better man was found
by the crier on his round
through the town
but now he walks the streets
and he looks at all he meets
sad and wan
and he shakes his feeble head
that it seems as if he said
the mossy marbles rest
on the lips that he has prest
in their bloom
and the names he loved to hear
have been carved for many a year
on the tomb
my grandmamma has said
poor old lady, she is dead
long ago
that he had a roman nose
and his cheek was like a rose
in the snow
but now his nose is thin
and it rests upon his chin
like a staff
and a crook is in his back
and a melancholy crack
in his laugh
i know it is a sin
for me to sit and grin
at him here
but the old three-cornered hat
and the breeches, and all that
are so queer
and if i should live to be
the last leaf upon the tree
in the spring
let them smile, as i do now
at the old forsaken bough
where i cling
she's up there--old glory--where lightnings are sped
she dazzles the nations with ripples of red
and she'll wave for us living, or droop o'er us dead
the flag of our country forever
she's up there--old glory--how bright the stars stream
and the stripes like red signals of liberty gleam
and we dare for her, living, or dream the last dream
she's up there--old glory--no tyrant-dealt scars
no blur on her brightness, no stain on her stars
the brave blood of heroes hath crimsoned her bars
she's the flag of our country forever
the melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year
of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear
heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead
they rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread
the robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay
and from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day
where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood
in brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood
alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers
are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours
the rain is falling where they lie; but the cold november rain
calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again
the wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago
and the brier-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow
but on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood
and the yellow sun-flower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood
till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men
and the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade and glen
and now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come
to call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home
when the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still
and twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill
the south wind searches for the flowers, whose fragrance late he bore
and sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more
and then i think of one who in her youthful beauty died
the fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side
in the cold, moist earth we laid her when the forest cast the leaf
and we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief
yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours
so gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers
the rich man's son inherits lands
and piles of brick, and stone, and gold
and he inherits soft white hands
and tender flesh that fears the cold
nor dares to wear a garment old
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee
the rich man's son inherits cares
the bank may break, the factory burn
a breath may burst his bubble shares
and soft white hands could hardly earn
a living that would serve his turn
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee
the rich man's son inherits wants
his stomach craves for dainty fare
with sated heart, he hears the pants
of toiling hinds with brown arms bare
and wearies in his easy-chair
a heritage, it seems to me
one scarce would wish to hold in fee
what doth the poor man's son inherit
stout muscles and a sinewy heart
a hardy frame, a hardier spirit
king of two hands, he does his part
in every useful toil and art
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee
what doth the poor man's son inherit
wishes o'erjoyed with humble things
a rank, adjudged by toil-won merit
content that from employment springs
a heart that in his labor sings
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee
what doth the poor man's son inherit
a patience learned of being poor
courage, if sorrow come, to bear it
a fellow-feeling that is sure
to make the outcast bless his door
a heritage, it seems to me
a king might wish to hold in fee
o rich man's son! there is a toil
that with all others level stands
large charity doth never soil
but only whiten, soft white hands
this is the best crop from thy lands
a heritage it seems to me
worth being rich to hold in fee
o poor man's son! scorn not thy state
there is worse weariness than thine
in merely being rich and great
toil only gives the soul to shine
and makes rest fragrant and benign
a heritage, it seems to me
worth being poor to hold in fee
both heirs to some six feet of sod
are equal in the earth at last
both, children of the same dear god
prove title to your heirship vast
by record of a well-filled past
a heritage, it seems to me
well worth a life to hold in fee
oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends
of the earth
kamal is out with twenty men to raise the border side
and he has lifted the colonel's mare that is the colonel's pride
he has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day
and turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away
then up and spoke the colonel's son that led a troop of the guides
then up and spoke mahommed khan, the son of the ressaldar
at dust he harries the abazai--at dawn he is into bonair
but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare
so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
by the favor of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai
but if he be passed the tongue of jagai, right swiftly turn ye then
for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamal's
there is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn
between
and ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen
the colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he
with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell, and the head of the
gallows-tree
the colonel's son to the fort has won, they bid him stay to eat
who rides at the tail of a border thief, he sits not long at his meat
he's up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly
till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai
till he was aware of his father's mare with kamal upon her back
and when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack
he has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide
it's up and over the tongue of jagai, as blown dust-devils go
the dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe
the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
but the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a
glove
there was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn
between
and thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen
they have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn
the dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn
the dun he fell at a water-course--in a woful heap fell he
and kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free
he has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to strive
there was not a rock of twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree
but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee
if i had raised my bridle-hand, as i have held it low
the little jackals that flee so fast, were feasting all in a row
if i had bowed my head on my breast, as i have held it high
the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
lightly answered the colonel's son: "do good to bird and beast
but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast
if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay
they will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered
grain
the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are
slain
but if thou thinkest the price be fair,--thy brethren wait to sup
the hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, howl, dog, and call them up
and if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack
give me my father's mare again, and i'll fight my own way back
kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death
lightly answered the colonel's son: "i hold by the blood of my clan
take up the mare of my father's gift--by god, she has carried a man
the red mare ran to the colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast
so she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein
my broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain
the colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end
a friend
thy father has sent his son to me, i'll send my son to him
with that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest
he trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest
and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
till death or i cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed
thy life is his--thy fate is to guard him with thy head
so thou must eat the white queen's meat, and all her foes are thine
and thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the border-line
and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur
they have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no
fault
they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood on leavened bread and
they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood  on fire and fresh-cut
on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife, and the wondrous names of
the colonel's son he rides the mare and kamal's boy the dun
and two have come back to fort bukloh where there went forth but one
and when they drew to the quarter-guard, full twenty swords flew clear
there was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer
sides
last night ye had struck at a border thief--to-night 'tis a man of the
guides
oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the two shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends
of the earth
it was many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
i was a child, and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
and this was the reason that, long ago
in this kingdom by the sea
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea
the angels, not half so happy in heaven
went envying her and me
yes! that was the reason (as all men know
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night
chilling and killing my annabel lee
but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above
nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee
for the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise, but i feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so all the night-tide, i lie down by the side
of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the sounding sea
there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, in the garden-bed
the crocuses stood straight and gold
there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, thro' the woodland spread
the mayflowers, pink and sweet as youth
there fell an april shower, one night
next morning, sweetly, overhead
the blue-birds sung, the blue-birds sung
i come, i come! ye have called me long
i come o'er the mountains, with light and song
ye may trace my step o'er the waking earth
by the winds which tell of the violet's birth
by the primrose stars in the shadowy grass
by the green leaves opening as i pass
i have breathed on the south, and the chestnut flowers
by thousands have burst from the forest bowers
and the ancient graves and the fallen fanes
are veiled with wreaths as italian plains
but it is not for me, in my hour of bloom
to speak of the ruin or the tomb
i have looked o'er the hills of the stormy north
and the larch has hung all his tassels forth
the fisher is out on the sunny sea
and the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free
and the pine has a fringe of softer green
and the moss looks bright, where my step has been
i have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh
and called out each voice of the deep blue sky
from the night-bird's lay through the starry time
in the groves of the soft hesperian clime
to the swan's wild note by the iceland lakes
when the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks
from the streams and founts i have loosed the chain
they are sweeping on to the silvery main
they are flashing down from the mountain brows
they are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs
they are bursting fresh from their sparry caves
and the earth resounds with the joy of waves
has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys
if there has take him out, without making a noise
hang the almanac's cheat and the catalogue's spite
old time is a liar! we're twenty tonight
we're twenty! we're twenty! who says we are more
he's tipsy--young jackanapes!--show him the door
where the snowflakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze
was it snowing i spoke of? excuse the mistake
look close--you will see not a sign of a flake
we want some new garlands for those we have shed
and these are white roses in place of the red
we've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told
of talking (in public) as if we were old
that boy we call "doctor," and this we call "judge
it's a neat little fiction--of course it's all fudge
that fellow's the "speaker"--the one on the right
that's our "member of congress," we say when we chaff
there's the "reverend" what's-his-name?--don't make me laugh
that boy with the grave mathematical look
made believe he had written a wonderful book
and the royal society thought it was _true
so they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too
there's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain
that could harness a team with a logical chain
when he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire
we called him "the justice," but now he's "the squire
and there's a nice youngster of excellent pith
fate tried to conceal him by naming him smith
but he shouted a song for the brave and the free
just read on his medal, "my country," "of thee
you hear that boy laughing? you think he's all fun
but the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done
the children laugh loud as they troop to his call
and the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all
yes, we're boys--always playing with tongue or with pen
and i sometimes have asked, shall we ever be men
shall we always be youthful and laughing and gay
till the last dear companion drops smiling away
then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray
the stars of its winter, the dews of its may
and when we have done with our life-lasting toys
the day is cold, and dark, and dreary
it rains, and the wind is never weary
the vine still clings to the mouldering wall
but at every gust the dead leaves fall
and the day is dark and dreary
my life is cold, and dark, and dreary
it rains, and the wind is never weary
my thoughts still cling to the mouldering past
but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast
and the days are dark and dreary
be still, sad heart! and cease repining
behind the clouds is the sun still shining
thy fate is the common fate of all
into each life some rain must fall
some days must be dark and dreary
of the "house by the side of the way
our master had neither a house nor a home
but he walked with the crowd day by day
and i think, when i read of the poet's desire
that a house by the road would be good
but service is found in its tenderest form
when we walk with the crowd in the road
so i say, let me walk with the men in the road
let me seek out the burdens that crush
let me speak a kind word of good cheer to the weak
who are falling behind in the rush
there are wounds to be healed, there are breaks we must mend
there's a cup of cold water to give
and the man in the road by the side of his friend
is the man who has learned to live
then tell me no more of the house by the road
there is only one place i can live
it's there with the men who are toiling along
who are needing the cheer i can give
it is pleasant to live in the house by the way
and be a friend, as the poet has said
but the master is bidding us, "bear ye their load
for your rest waiteth yonder ahead
i could not remain in the house by the road
and watch as the toilers go on
their faces beclouded with pain and with sin
so burdened, their strength nearly gone
i'll go to their side, i'll speak in good cheer
i'll help them to carry their load
and i'll smile at the man in the house by the way
as i walk with the crowd in the road
out there in the road that goes by the house
where the poet is singing his song
i'll walk and i'll work midst the heat of the day
and i'll help falling brothers along
too busy to live in the house by the way
too happy for such an abode
and my heart sings its praise to the master of all
who is helping me serve in the road
could we but draw back the curtains
that surround each other's lives
see the naked heart and spirit
know what spur the action gives
often we should find it better
purer than we judged we should
we should love each other better
if we only understood
could we judge all deeds by motives
see the good and bad within
often we should love the sinner
all the while we loathe the sin
could we know the powers working
to o'erthrow integrity
we should judge each other's errors
with more patient charity
if we knew the cares and trials
knew the effort all in vain
and the bitter disappointment
understood the loss and gain
would the grim, eternal roughness
seem--i wonder--just the same
should we help where now we hinder
should we pity where we blame
ah! we judge each other harshly
knowing not life's hidden force
knowing not the fount of action
is less turbid at its source
seeing not amid the evil
all the golden grains of good
oh! we'd love each other better
if we only understood
she sat on the sliding cushion
the dear, wee woman of four
her feet, in their shiny slippers
hung dangling over the floor
she meant to be good; she had promised
and so, with her big, brown eyes
she stared at the meeting-house windows
and counted the crawling flies
she looked far up at the preacher
but she thought of the honey bees
droning away at the blossoms
that whitened the cherry trees
she thought of a broken basket
where, curled in a dusky heap
lay snuggled and fast asleep
such soft warm bodies to cuddle
such queer little hearts to beat
such swift, round tongues to kiss
such sprawling, cushiony feet
she could feel in her clasping fingers
the touch of a satiny skin
and a cold wet nose exploring
the dimples under her chin
then a sudden ripple of laughter
ran over the parted lips
so quick that she could not catch it
with her rosy finger-tips
the people whispered, "bless the child
as each one waked from a nap
but the dear, wee woman hid her face
for shame in her mother's lap
it was an old, old, old, old lady
and a boy that was half past three
and the way that they played together
was beautiful to see
she couldn't go running and jumping
and the boy, no more could he
for he was a thin little fellow
with a thin little twisted knee
they sat in the yellow sunlight
out under the maple-tree
and the game that they played i'll tell you
just as it was told to me
it was hide-and-go-seek they were playing
though you'd never have known it to be
with an old, old, old, old lady
and a boy with a twisted knee
the boy would bend his face down
on his one little sound right knee
and he'd guess where she was hiding
in guesses one, two, three
he would cry, and laugh with glee
it wasn't the china-closet
but he still had two and three
in the chest with the queer old key
and she said: "you are _warm_ and _warmer
but you're not quite right," said she
where mamma's things used to be
so it must be the clothes-press, gran'ma
and he found her with his three
then she covered her face with her fingers
that were wrinkled and white and wee
and she guessed where the boy was hiding
with a one and a two and a three
and they never had stirred from their places
right under the maple-tree
this old, old, old, old lady
and the boy with the lame little knee
this dear, dear, dear old lady
and the boy who was half past three
they said, "the master is coming
to honor the town to-day
and none can tell at what house or home
the master will choose to stay
and i thought while my heart beat wildly
what if he should come to mine
how would i strive to entertain
and honor the guest divine
and straight i turned to toiling
to make my house more neat
i swept, and polished, and garnished
and decked it with blossoms sweet
i was troubled for fear the master
might come ere my work was done
and i hasted and worked the faster
and watched the hurrying sun
but right in the midst of my duties
a woman came to my door
she had come to tell me her sorrows
and my comfort and aid to implore
and i said, "i cannot listen
nor help you any, to-day
i have greater things to attend to
and the pleader turned away
but soon there came another
a cripple, thin, pale and gray
and said, "oh, let me stop and rest
a while in your house, i pray
i have traveled far since morning
i am hungry, and faint, and weak
my heart is full of misery
and comfort and help i seek
and i cried, "i am grieved and sorry
but i cannot help you to-day
i look for a great and noble guest
and the cripple went away
and the day wore onward swiftly
and my task was nearly done
and a prayer was ever in my heart
that the master to me might come
and i thought i would spring to meet him
and serve him with utmost care
when a little child stood by me
with a face so sweet and fair
sweet, but with marks of teardrops
and his clothes were tattered and old
a finger was bruised and bleeding
and his little bare feet were cold
and i said, "i'm sorry for you
you are sorely in need of care
but i cannot stop to give it
you must hasten otherwhere
and at the words, a shadow
swept o'er his blue-veined brow
but i am too busy now
at last the day was ended
and my toil was over and done
my house was swept and garnished
and i watched in the dark--alone
watched--but no footfall sounded
no one paused at my gate
no one entered my cottage door
i could only pray--and wait
i waited till night had deepened
and the master had not come
my labor had been for nothing
and i bowed my head and i wept
my heart was sore with longing
yet--in spite of it all--i slept
then the master stood before me
and his face was grave and fair
and craved your pity and care
three times you sent me onward
unhelped and uncomforted
and the blessing you might have had was lost
and your chance to serve has fled
how could i know it was thee
my very soul was shamed and bowed
in the depths of humility
and he said, "the sin is pardoned
but the blessing is lost to thee
for comforting not the least of mine
you have failed to comfort me
i wish there were some wonderful place
called the land of beginning again
where all our mistakes and all our heartaches
and all our poor, selfish griefs
could be dropped, like a shabby old coat, at the door
and never put on again
i wish we could come on it all unaware
like the hunter who finds a lost trail
and i wish that the one whom our blindness had done
the greatest injustice of all
could be at the gate like the old friend that waits
for the comrade he's gladdest to hail
we would find the things we intended to do
but forgot and remembered too late
little praises unspoken, little promises broken
and all of the thousand and one
little duties neglected that might have perfected
the days of one less fortunate
it wouldn't be possible not to be kind
in the land of beginning again
and the ones we misjudged and the ones whom we grudged
their moments of victory here
would find the grasp of our loving handclasp
more than penitent lips could explain
for what had been hardest we'd know had been best
and what had seemed loss would be gain
for there isn't a sting that will not take wing
when we've faced it and laughed it away
and i think that the laughter is most what we're after
in the land of beginning again
so i wish that there were some wonderful place
called the land of beginning again
where all our mistakes and all our heartaches
and all our poor, selfish griefs
could be dropped, like a ragged old coat, at the door
and never put on again
prop yer eyes wide open, joey
fur i've brought you sumpin' great
apples? no, a derned sight better
don't you take no int'rest? wait

oh, my god, can joe be dead
saint augustine! well hast thou said
that of our vices we can frame
a ladder, if we will but tread
beneath our feet each deed of shame
all common things, each day's events
that with the hour begin and end
our pleasures and our discontents
are rounds by which we may ascend
the low desire, the base design
that makes another's virtues less
the revel of the ruddy wine
and all occasions of excess
the longing for ignoble things
the strife for triumph more than truth
the hardening of the heart, that brings
irreverence for the dreams of youth
all thoughts of ill; all evil deeds
that have their root in thoughts of ill
whatever hinders or impedes
the action of the nobler will
all these must first be trampled down
beneath our feet, if we would gain
in the bright fields of fair renown
the right of eminent domain
we have not wings, we cannot soar
but we have feet to scale and climb
by slow degrees, by more and more
the cloudy summits of our time
the mighty pyramids of stone
that wedge-like cleave the desert airs
when nearer seen, and better known
are but gigantic flights of stairs
the distant mountains, that uprear
their solid bastions to the skies
are crossed by pathways, that appear
as we to higher levels rise
the heights by great men reached and kept
were not attained by sudden flight
but they, while their companions slept
were toiling upward in the night
standing on what too long we bore
with shoulders bent and downcast eyes
we may discern--unseen before
a path to higher destinies
nor deem the irrevocable past
as wholly wasted, wholly vain
if, rising on its wrecks, at last
to something nobler we attain
when i compare
what i have lost with what i have gained
what i have missed with what attained
little room do i find for pride
i am aware
how many days have been idly spent
how like an arrow the good intent
has fallen short or been turned aside
but who shall dare
to measure loss and gain in this wise
defeat may be victory in disguise
the lowest ebb in the turn of the tide
a fellow near kentucky's clime
cries, "boatman, do not tarry
and i'll give thee a silver dime
to row us o'er the ferry
this dark and stormy water
and she john thompson's daughter
with great precipitation
and should he find us here to-night
i'd lose my reputation
his horsemen hard have pressed me
and who will cheer my bonny bride
if yet they shall arrest me
out spoke the boatman then in time
i'll go not for your silver dime
but--for your manly spirit
in danger shall not tarry
for though a storm is coming on
i'll row you o'er the ferry
by this the wind more fiercely rose
the boat was at the landing
and with the drenching rain their clothes
grew wet where they were standing
but still, as wilder rose the wind
and as the night grew drearer
just back a piece came the police
their tramping sounded nearer
i'll leave the light of loving eyes
but not my father's money
and still they hurried in the race
of wind and rain unsparing
john thompson reached the landing-place
his wrath was turned to swearing
for by the lightning's angry flash
his child he did discover
one lovely hand held all the cash
and one was round her lover
across the stormy water
my daughter, oh, my daughter
the gold he piled went with his child
and he was left there, minus
my grandfather's clock was too tall for the shelf
so it stood ninety years on the floor
it was taller by half than the old man himself
though it weighed not a pennyweight more
it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
and was always his treasure and pride
but it stopped short ne'er to go again
when the old man died
in watching its pendulum swing to and fro
many hours had he spent while a boy
and in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know
and to share both his grief and his joy
for it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door
with a blooming and beautiful bride
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
my grandfather said that of those he could hire
not a servant so faithful he found
for it wasted no time and had but one desire
at the close of each week to be wound
and it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
and its hands never hung by its side
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
hush! my dear, lie still and slumber
holy angels guard thy bed
heavenly blessings without number
gently falling on thy head
sleep, my babe; thy food and raiment
house and home, thy friends provide
all without thy care or payment
all thy wants are well supplied
how much better thou'rt attended
than the son of god could be
when from heaven he descended
and became a child like thee
soft and easy is thy cradle
coarse and hard thy saviour lay
when his birthplace was a stable
and his softest bed was hay
blessed babe! what glorious features
spotless fair, divinely bright
must he dwell with brutal creatures
how could angels bear the sight
was there nothing but a manger
cursed sinners could afford
to receive the heavenly stranger
did they thus affront their lord
soft, my child: i did not chide thee
though my song might sound too hard
and her arm shall be thy guard
telling wonders from the sky
where they sought him, there they found him
with his virgin mother by
see the lovely babe a-dressing
lovely infant, how he smiled
when he wept, his mother's blessing
soothed and hush'd the holy child
lo, he slumbers in a manger
where the hornèd oxen fed
peace, my darling, here's no danger
there's no ox anear thy bed
trust and love him all thy days
then go dwell forever near him
see his face, and sing his praise
if all the skies were sunshine
our faces would be fain
to feel once more upon them
the cooling splash of rain
if all the world were music
our hearts would often long
for one sweet strain of silence
to break the endless song
if life were always merry
our souls would seek relief
and rest from weary laughter
in the quiet arms of grief
in a valley, centuries ago
grew a little fern leaf, green and slender
veining delicate and fibers tender
waving when the wind crept down so low
rushes tall, and moss, and grass grew round it
playful sunbeams darted in and found it
drops of dew stole down by night and crowned it
but no foot of man e'er came that way
earth was young and keeping holiday
monster fishes swam the silent main
stately forests waved their giant branches
mountains hurled their snowy avalanches
mammoth creatures stalked across the plain
nature reveled in grand mysteries
but the little fern was not like these
did not number with the hills and trees
only grew and waved its sweet, wild way
no one came to note it day by day
earth, one time, put on a frolic mood
heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion
of the strong, dread currents of the ocean
moved the hills and shook the haughty wood
crushed the little fern in soft, moist clay
covered it, and hid it safe away
oh, the long, long centuries since that day
oh, the changes! oh, life's bitter cost
since the little useless fern was lost
useless? lost? there came a thoughtful man
searching nature's secrets far and deep
from a fissure in a rocky steep
he withdrew a stone, o'er which there ran
fairy pencilings, a quaint design
leafage, veining, fibers, clear and fine
and the fern's life lay in every line
so, i think, god hides some souls away
sweetly to surprise us the last day
cleon hath ten thousand acres
cleon dwelleth in a palace
cleon hath a dozen fortunes
yet the poorer of the twain is
cleon, true, possesseth acres
half the charms to me it yieldeth
money cannot buy
cleon harbors sloth and dullness
he in velvet, i in fustian
cleon is a slave to grandeur
cleon fees a score of doctors
wealth-surrounded, care-environed
cleon fears to die
death may come--he'll find me ready
cleon sees no charms in nature
cleon hears no anthems ringing
nature sings to me forever
state for state, with all attendants
great were the hearts and strong the minds
of those who framed in high debate
the immortal league of love that binds
our fair, broad empire, state with state
and deep the gladness of the hour
when, as the auspicious task was done
in solemn trust the sword of power
was given to glory's unspoiled son
that noble race is gone--the suns
of fifty years have risen and set
but the bright links, those chosen ones
so strongly forged, are brighter yet
wide--as our own free race increase
wide shall extend the elastic chain
and bind in everlasting peace
state after state, a mighty train
a parody on "curfew shall not ring tonight
slow the kansas sun was setting
o'er the wheat fields far away
streaking all the air with cobwebs
at the close of one hot day
and the last rays kissed the forehead
of a man and maiden fair
he with whiskers short and frowsy
she with red and glistening hair
he with shut jaws stern and silent
she, with lips all cold and white
struggled to keep back the murmur
and i have a real lover
though he's rather young and green
but he has a horse and buggy
and a cow and thirty hens
boys that start out poor, dear papa
make the best of honest men
but if towser sees and bites him
fills his eyes with misty light
he will never come again, pa
towser must be tied to-night
like a carving knife through chicken
as it hunts the tender part
two of them are ripe to-day
towser must be loose to watch them
or they'll all be stole away
i have hoed them late and early
in dim morn and evening light
now they're grown i must not lose them
towser'll not be tied to-night
then the old man ambled forward
opened wide the kennel-door
towser bounded forth to meet him
as he oft had done before
and the farmer stooped and loosed him
from the dog-chain short and stout
to himself he softly chuckled
but the maiden at the window
saw the cruel teeth show white
in an undertone she murmured
then the maiden's brow grew thoughtful
and her breath came short and quick
till she spied the family clothesline
and she whispered, "that's the trick
from the kitchen door she glided
with a plate of meat and bread
towser wagged his tail in greeting
knowing well he would be fed
in his well-worn leather collar
tied she then the clothesline tight
all the time her white lips saying
but the front gate's free and open
when john henry lifts the latch
for the clothesline tight is fastened
to the harvest apple tree
you can run and watch the melons
but the front gate you can't see
then her glad ears hear a buggy
and her eyes grow big and bright
while her young heart says in gladness
up the path the young man saunters
with his eye and cheek aglow
for he loves the red-haired maiden
and he aims to tell her so
bessie's roguish little brother
in a fit of boyish glee
had untied the slender clothesline
from the harvest apple tree
then old towser heard the footsteps
raised his bristles, fixed for fight
then old towser bounded forward
passed the open kitchen door
bessie screamed and quickly followed
but john henry's gone before
down the path he speeds most quickly
for old towser sets the pace
and the maiden close behind them
shows them she is in the race
then the clothesline, can she get it
and her eyes grow big and bright
and she springs and grasps it firmly
oftentimes a little minute
forms the destiny of men
you can change the fate of nations
by the stroke of one small pen
towser made one last long effort
caught john henry by the pants
but john henry kept on running
for he thought that his last chance
but the maiden held on firmly
and the rope was drawn up tight
but old towser kept the garments
for he was not tied that night
then the father hears the racket
with long strides he soon is there
when john henry and the maiden
crouching, for the worst prepare
at his feet john tells his story
shows his clothing soiled and torn
and his face so sad and pleading
yet so white and scared and worn
touched the old man's heart with pity
filled his eyes with misty light
towser shall be tied to-night
o liberty, thou child of law
god's seal is on thy brow
o law, her mother first and last
god's very self art thou
two flowers alike, yet not alike
on the same stem that grow
two friends who cannot live apart
yet seem each other's foe
one, the smooth river's mirrored flow
which decks the world with green
and one, the bank of sturdy rock
which hems the river in
o daughter of the timeless past
o hope the prophets saw
god give us law in liberty
and liberty in law
beneath the hot midsummer sun
the men had marched all day
and now beside a rippling stream
upon the grass they lay
tiring of games and idle jest
as swept the hours along
they cried to one who mused apart
are those my mother used to sing
for me long years ago
to every mother's son of us
a mother's songs are dear
then sweetly rose the singer's voice
amid unwonted calm
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
the very stream was stilled
and hearts that never throbbed with fear
with tender thoughts were filled
ended the song, the singer said
as to his feet he rose
god grant us sweet repose
the soldier bent his head
then, glancing round, with smiling lips
sweet as the bugle call
let angels prostrate fall
ah, wondrous was the old tune's spell
as on the soldiers sang
man after man fell into line
and loud the voices rang
the songs are done, the camp is still
naught but the stream is heard
but, ah! the depths of every soul
by those old hymns are stirred
and up from many a bearded lip
in whispers soft and low
rises the prayer that mother taught
her boy long years ago
we all look on with anxious eyes
when father carves the duck
and mother almost always sighs
when father carves the duck
then all of us prepare to rise
and hold our bibs before our eyes
and be prepared for some surprise
when father carves the duck
he braces up and grabs the fork
whene'er he carves the duck
and won't allow a soul to talk
until he carves the duck
the fork is jabbed into the sides
across the breast the knife he slides
while every careful person hides
from flying chips of duck
the platter's always sure to slip
when father carves the duck
and how it makes the dishes skip
potatoes fly amuck
the squash and cabbage leap in space
we get some gravy in our face
and father mutters hindoo grace
whene'er he carves a duck
we then have learned to walk around
the dining room and pluck
from off the window-sills and walls
our share of father's duck
while father growls and blows and jaws
and swears the knife was full of flaws
and mother laughs at him because
he couldn't carve a duck
i was sitting in my study
writing letters when i heard
mamma mustn't be 'isturbed
want some ozzer fing to do
witing letters, is 'ou, mamma
tan't i wite a letter too
run and play with kitty, now
tan if 'ou will show me how
i would paint my darling's portrait
as his sweet eyes searched my face
hair of gold and eyes of azure
form of childish, witching grace
but the eager face was clouded
as i slowly shook my head
till i said, "i'll make a letter
of you, darling boy, instead
so i parted back the tresses
from his forehead high and white
and a stamp in sport i pasted
then i said, "now, little letter
go away and bear good news
and i smiled as down the staircase
clattered loud the little shoes
leaving me, the darling hurried
down to mary in his glee
i'se a letter, mary--see
no one heard the little prattler
as once more he climbed the stair
reached his little cap and tippet
standing on the entry stair
no one heard the front door open
no one saw the golden hair
as it floated o'er his shoulders
in the crisp october air
down the street the baby hastened
till he reached the office door
is there room for any more
papa lives with god, 'ou know
mamma sent me for a letter
does 'ou fink 'at i tan go
but the clerk in wonder answered
fain the clerk would have detained him
but the pleading face was gone
and the little feet were hastening
by the busy crowd swept on
suddenly the crowd was parted
people fled to left and right
as a pair of maddened horses
at the moment dashed in sight
no one saw the baby figure
no one saw the golden hair
till a voice of frightened sweetness
rang out on the autumn air
stood the beauteous vision there
then the little face lay lifeless
covered o'er with golden hair
reverently they raised my darling
brushed away the curls of gold
saw the stamp upon the forehead
growing now so icy cold
not a mark the face disfigured
showing where a hoof had trod
but the little life was ended
will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made
such a thing i'd never do
i gave you a wisp of hay
but didn't take your nest away
not i," said the cow, "moo-oo
such a thing i'd never do
will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made
i wouldn't be so mean, anyhow
i gave the hairs the nest to make
but the nest i did not take
not i," said the dog, "bow-wow
i'm not so mean, anyhow
will you listen to me
who stole four eggs i laid
and the nice nest i made
i wouldn't treat a poor bird so
i gave the wool the nest to line
but the nest was none of mine
baa! baa!" said the sheep; "oh, no
i wouldn't treat a poor bird so
what thief took away
a bird's nest to-day
said little mary green
of anything so mean
said little alice neal
how sad the bird would feel
a little boy hung down his head
and went and hid behind the bed
for he stole that pretty nest
from poor little yellow-breast
and he felt so full of shame
he didn't like to tell his name
i, who was always counted, they say
rather a bad stick anyway
splintered all over with dodges and tricks
known as "the worst of the deacon's six
i, the truant, saucy and bold
the one black sheep in my father's fold
went over the hill on a winter's day
tom could save what twenty could earn
but _givin'_ was somethin' he ne'er would learn
isaac could half o' the scriptur's speak
committed a hundred verses a week
never forgot, an' never slipped
but "honor thy father and mother," he skipped
as for susan, her heart was kind
an' good--what there was of it, mind
nothin' too big, an' nothin' too nice
nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice
for one she loved; an' that 'ere one
was herself, when all was said an' done
an' charley an' 'becca meant well, no doubt
but anyone could pull 'em about
an' all o' our folks ranked well, you see
save one poor fellow, an' that was me
an' when, one dark an' rainy night
a neighbor's horse went out o' sight
they hitched on me, as the guilty chap
that carried one end o' the halter-strap
an' i think, myself, that view of the case
wasn't altogether out o' place
my mother denied it, as mothers do
but i am inclined to believe 'twas true
though for me one thing might be said
that i, as well as the horse, was led
and the worst of whisky spurred me on
or else the deed would have never been done
but the keenest grief i ever felt
was when my mother beside me knelt
an' cried, an' prayed, till i melted down
as i wouldn't for half the horses in town
i kissed her fondly, then an' there
an' swore henceforth to be honest and square
i served my sentence--a bitter pill
some fellows should take who never will
and then i decided to go "out west
concludin' 'twould suit my health the best
where, how i prospered, i never could tell
but fortune seemed to like me well
an' somehow every vein i struck
was always bubbling over with luck
an', better than that, i was steady an' true
an' put my good resolutions through
but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor, an' said
an' died a christian; 'twill please 'em more
than if i had lived the same as before
but when this neighbor he wrote to me
i had a resurrection straightway
an' started for her that very day
and when i arrived where i was grown
i took good care that i shouldn't be known
but i bought the old cottage, through and through
of someone charley had sold it to
and held back neither work nor gold
to fix it up as it was of old
the same big fire-place, wide and high
flung up its cinders toward the sky
the old clock ticked on the corner-shelf
i wound it an' set it a-goin' myself
an' if everything wasn't just the same
neither i nor money was to blame
one blowin', blusterin' winter's day
with a team an' cutter i started away
my fiery nags was as black as coal
i hitched, an' entered the poor-house door
a poor old woman was scrubbin' the floor
she rose to her feet in great surprise
and looked, quite startled, into my eyes
i saw the whole of her trouble's trace
in the lines that marred her dear old face
you're adopted along o' your horse thief son
she didn't faint; she knelt by my side
an' thanked the lord, till i fairly cried
an' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant an' gay
an' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day
an' maybe our cottage wasn't warm an' bright
an' maybe it wasn't a pleasant sight
to see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea
an' frequently stoppin' an' kissin' me
an' maybe we didn't live happy for years
in spite of my brothers' and sisters' sneers
who often said, as i have heard
that they wouldn't own a prison-bird
for all of 'em owe me more or less
but i've learned one thing; an' it cheers a man
in always a-doin' the best he can
that whether on the big book, a blot
gets over a fellow's name or not
whenever he does a deed that's white
it's credited to him fair and right
an' when you hear the great bugle's notes
an' the lord divides his sheep and goats
however they may settle my case
wherever they may fix my place
my good old christian mother, you'll see
will be sure to stand right up for me
with _over the hill from the poor-house
i was mighty good-lookin' when i was young
peart an' black-eyed an' slim
with fellers a-courtin' me sunday nights
the likeliest one of 'em all was he
chipper an' han'som' an' trim
but i tossed up my head an' made fun o' the crowds
i said i hadn't no 'pinion o' men
an' i wouldn't take stock in him
but they kep' up a-comin' in spite o' my talk
i got so tired o' havin' 'em roun
i made up my mind i'd settle down
an' take up with him
so we was married one sunday in church
o'grady lived in shanty row
the neighbors often said
they wished that tim would move away
or that his goat was dead
he kept the neighborhood in fear
and the children always vexed
they couldn't tell jist whin or where
the goat would pop up next
ould missis casey stood wan day
the dirty clothes to rub
upon the washboard, when she dived
headforemosht o'er the tub
she lit upon her back an' yelled
as she was lying flat
o'grady's goat doon that
pat doolan's woife hung out the wash
upon the line to dry
she wint to take it in at night
but stopped to have a cry
the sleeves av two red flannel shirts
that once were worn by pat
were chewed off almost to the neck
o'grady's goat doon that
they had a party at mccune's
an' they wor having foon
whin suddinly there was a crash
an' ivrybody roon
the iseter soup fell on the floor
an' nearly drowned the cat
the stove was knocked to smithereens
o'grady's goat doon that
moike dyle was coortin' biddy shea
both standin' at the gate
an' they wor just about to kiss
aich oother sly and shwate
they coom togither loike two rams
an' mashed their noses flat
they niver shpake whin they goes by
o'grady's goat doon that
o'hoolerhan brought home a keg
av dannymite wan day
to blow a cistern in his yard
an' hid the stuff away
but suddinly an airthquake coom
o'hoolerhan, house an' hat
an' ivrything in sight wint up
o'grady's goat doon that
an' there was dooley's savhin's bank
that held the byes' sphare cash
one day the news came doon the sthreet
the bank had gone to smash
an' ivrybody 'round was dum
wid anger and wid fear
fer on the dhoor they red the whords
the folks in grady's naborhood
all live in fear and fright
they think it's certain death to go
around there after night
an' in their shlape they see a ghost
upon the air afloat
an' wake thimselves by shoutin' out
bethpeor; but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
by nebo's lonely mountain
on this side jordan's wave
in a vale in the land of moab
there lies a lonely grave
and no man knows that sepulchre
and no man saw it e'er
for the angels of god upturn'd the sod
and laid the dead man there
that was the grandest funeral
that ever pass'd on earth
but no man heard the trampling
or saw the train go forth
noiselessly as the daylight
comes back when night is done
and the crimson streak on ocean's cheek
grows into the great sun
noiselessly as the springtime
her crown of verdure weaves
and all the trees on all the hills
open their thousand leaves
so without sound of music
or voice of them that wept
silently down from the mountain's crown
the great procession swept
perchance the bald old eagle
on gray beth-peor's height
out of his lonely eyrie
look'd on the wondrous sight
perchance the lion, stalking
still shuns that hallow'd spot
for beast and bird have seen and heard
that which man knoweth not
but when the warrior dieth
his comrades in the war
with arms reversed and muffled drum
follow his funeral car
they show the banners taken
they tell his battles won
and after him lead his masterless steed
while peals the minute gun
amid the noblest of the land
we lay the sage to rest
and give the bard an honor'd place
with costly marble drest
in the great minster transept
where lights like glories fall
and the organ rings, and the sweet choir sings
along the emblazon'd wall
this was the truest warrior
that ever buckled sword
this was the most gifted poet
that ever breathed a word
and never earth's philosopher
traced with his golden pen
on the deathless page, truths half so sage
as he wrote down for men
and had he not high honor
the hillside for a pall
to lie in state while angels wait
with stars for tapers tall
and the dark rock-pines like tossing plumes
over his bier to wave
and god's own hand, in that lonely land
to lay him in the grave
in that strange grave without a name
whence his uncoffin'd clay
shall break again, o wondrous thought
before the judgment day
and stand with glory wrapt around
on the hills he never trod
and speak of the strife that won our life
with the incarnate son of god
o lonely grave in moab's land
o dark beth-peor's hill
speak to these curious hearts of ours
and teach them to be still
god hath his mysteries of grace
ways that we cannot tell
he hides them deep like the hidden sleep
of him he loved so well
alone in the dreary, pitiless street
with my torn old dress, and bare, cold feet
all day have i wandered to and fro
hungry and shivering, and nowhere to go
the night's coming on in darkness and dread
and the chill sleet beating upon my bare head
oh! why does the wind blow upon me so wild
is it because i am nobody's child
just over the way there's a flood of light
and warmth, and beauty, and all things bright
beautiful children, in robes so fair
are caroling songs in their rapture there
i wonder if they, in their blissful glee
would pity a poor little beggar like me
wandering alone in the merciless street
naked and shivering, and nothing to eat
oh! what shall i do when the night comes down
in its terrible blackness all over the town
shall i lay me down 'neath the angry sky
on the cold, hard pavement, alone to die
when the beautiful children their prayers have said
and their mammas have tucked them up snugly in bed
for no dear mother on me ever smiled
why is it, i wonder, i'm nobody's child
no father, no mother, no sister, not one
in all the world loves me--e'en the little dogs run
when i wander too near them; 'tis wondrous to see
how everything shrinks from a beggar like me
perhaps 'tis a dream; but sometimes, when i lie
gazing far up in the dark blue sky
watching for hours some large bright star
i fancy the beautiful gates are ajar
and a host of white-robed, nameless things
come fluttering o'er me on gilded wings
a hand that is strangely soft and fair
caresses gently my tangled hair
and a voice like the carol of some wild bird
the sweetest voice that was ever heard
calls me many a dear, pet name
till my heart and spirit are all aflame
they tell me of such unbounded love
and bid me come to their home above
and then with such pitiful, sad surprise
they look at me with their sweet, tender eyes
and it seems to me, out of the dreary night
i am going up to that world of light
and away from the hunger and storm so wild
i am sure i shall then be somebody's child
like a dream, it all comes o'er me as i hear the christmas bells
like a dream it floats before me, while the christmas anthem swells
like a dream it bears me onward in the silent, mystic flow
to a dear old sunny christmas in the happy long ago
and my thoughts go backward, backward, and the years that intervene
are but as the mists and shadows when the sunlight comes between
and all earthly wealth and splendor seem but as a fleeting show
as there comes to me the picture of a christmas long ago
i can see the great, wide hearthstone and the holly hung about
i can see the smiling faces, i can hear the children shout
i can feel the joy and gladness that the old room seem to fill
e'en the shadows on the ceiling--i can see them dancing still
i can see the little stockings hung about the chimney yet
i can feel my young heart thrilling lest the old man should forget
ah! that fancy! were the world mine, i would give it, if i might
to believe in old st. nicholas, and be a child to-night
just to hang my little stocking where it used to hang, and feel
for one moment all the old thoughts and the old hopes o'er me steal
but, oh! loved and loving faces, in the firelight's dancing glow
there will never come another like that christmas long ago
for the old home is deserted, and the ashes long have lain
in the great, old-fashioned fireplace that will never shine again
friendly hands that then clasped ours now are folded 'neath the snow
gone the dear ones who were with us on that christmas long ago
let the children have their christmas--let them have it while they may
life is short and childhood's fleeting, and there'll surely come a day
when st. nicholas will sadly pass on by the close-shut door
missing all the merry faces that had greeted him of yore
when no childish step shall echo through the quiet, silent room
when no childish smile shall brighten, and no laughter lift the gloom
when the shadows that fall 'round us in the fire-light's fitful glow
shall be ghosts of those who sat there in the christmas long ago
one sweetly solemn thought
comes to me o'er and o'er
i am nearer home to-day
than i've ever been before
nearer my father's house
where the many mansions be
nearer the great white throne
nearer the jasper sea
nearer the bound of life
where we lay our burdens down
nearer leaving the cross
nearer gaining the crown
but lying darkly between
winding down through the night
is the dim and unknown stream
that leads at last to the light
closer and closer my steps
come to the dark abysm
closer death to my lips
presses the awful chrism
father, perfect my trust
strengthen the might of my faith
let me feel as i would when i stand
on the rock of the shore of death
feel as i would when my feet
are slipping o'er the brink
for it may be i am nearer home
nearer now than i think
grandma told me all about it
told me so i could not doubt it
how she danced, my grandma danced, long ago
how she held her pretty head
how her dainty skirts she spread
how she turned her little toes
smiling little human rose
grandma's hair was bright and shining
dimpled cheeks, too! ah! how funny
bless me, now she wears a cap
my grandma does, and takes a nap every single day
yet she danced the minuet long ago
now she sits there rocking, rocking
always knitting grandpa's stocking
every girl was taught to knit long ago
but her figure is so neat
and her ways so staid and sweet
i can almost see her now
bending to her partner's bow, long ago
grandma says our modern jumping
rushing, whirling, dashing, bumping
would have shocked the gentle people long ago
no, they moved with stately grace
everything in proper place
gliding slowly forward, then
slowly courtesying back again
modern ways are quite alarming, grandma says
but boys were charming
girls and boys i mean, of course--long ago
sweetly modest, bravely shy
what if all of us should try just to feel
like those who met in the stately minuet, long ago
with the minuet in fashion
who could fly into a passion
all would wear the calm they wore long ago
and if in years to come, perchance
i tell my grandchild of our dance
i should really like to say
we did it in some such way, long ago
roger's my dog--come here, you scamp
jump for the gentleman--mind your eye
over the table--look out for the lamp
the rogue is growing a little old
five years we've tramped through wind and weather
and slept outdoors when nights were cold
and ate, and drank--and starved together
we've learned what comfort is, i tell you
a bed on the floor, a bit of rosin
a fire to thaw our thumbs (poor fellow
the paw he holds up there has been frozen
plenty of catgut for my fiddle
then a few nice buckwheats hot from the griddle
and roger and i set up for kings
no, thank you, sir, i never drink
roger and i are exceedingly moral
aren't we, roger? see him wink
well, something hot then, we won't quarrel
he's thirsty, too--see him nod his head
what a pity, sir, that dogs can't talk
he understands every word that's said
and he knows good milk from water and chalk
the truth is, sir, now i reflect
i've been so sadly given to grog
i wonder i've not lost the respect
but he sticks by through thick and thin
and this old coat with its empty pockets
and rags that smell of tobacco and gin
he'll follow while he has eyes in his sockets
there isn't another creature living
would do it, and prove, through every disaster
so fond, so faithful, and so forgiving
to such a miserable, thankless master
no, sir! see him wag his tail and grin
by george! it makes my old eyes water
that is, there's something in this gin
that chokes a fellow, but no matter
we'll have some music, if you're willing
and roger (hem! what a plague a cough is, sir
shall march a little.--start, you villain
paws up! eyes front! salute your officer
your cap while the gentleman gives a trifle
to aid a poor old patriot soldier
march! halt! now show how the rebel shakes
when he stands up to hear his sentence
now tell me how many drams it takes
to honor a jolly new acquaintance
five yelps--that's five; he's mighty knowing
the night's before us, fill the glasses
quick, sir! i'm ill, my brain is going
some brandy,--thank you;--there,--it passes
why not reform? that's easily said
but i've gone through such wretched treatment
sometimes forgetting the taste of bread
and scarce remembering what meat meant
that my poor stomach's past reform
and there are times when, mad with thinking
i'd sell out heaven for something warm
to prop a horrible inward sinking
is there a way to forget to think
at your age, sir, home, fortune, friends
a dear girl's love,--but i took to drink
the same old story; you know how it ends
if you could have seen these classic features
you needn't laugh, sir; i was not then
such a burning libel on god's creatures
i was one of your handsome men
if you had seen her, so fair, so young
whose head was happy on this breast
if you could have heard the songs i sung
when the wine went round, you wouldn't have guess'd
that ever i, sir, should be straying
from door to door, with fiddle and dog
ragged and penniless, and playing
to you to-night for a glass of grog
she's married since,--a parson's wife
better the soberest, prosiest life
than a blasted home and a broken heart
i have seen her--once; i was weak and spent
on the dusty road; a carriage stopped
but little she dreamed as on she went
who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped
you've set me talking, sir; i'm sorry
it makes me wild to think of the change
what do you care for a beggar's story
is it amusing? you find it strange
i had a mother so proud of me
if the happy spirits in heaven can see
the ruin and wretchedness here below
another glass, and strong, to deaden
this pain; then roger and i will start
i wonder, has he such a lumpish, leaden
aching thing, in place of a heart
he is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could
no doubt, remembering things that were
a virtuous kennel, with plenty of food
and himself a sober, respectable cur
i'm better now; that glass was warming
you rascal! limber your lazy feet
we must be fiddling and performing
for supper and bed, or starve in the street
not a very gay life to lead, you think
but soon we shall go where lodgings are free
and the sleepers need neither victuals nor drink
the sooner, the better for roger and me
oh, a wonderful stream is the river of time
as it runs through the realm of tears
with a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme
and a boundless sweep and a surge sublime
as it blends with the ocean of years
how the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow
and the summers, like buds between
and the year in the sheaf--so they come and they go
on the river's breast, with its ebb and flow
as it glides in the shadow and sheen
there's a magical isle up the river of time
where the softest of airs are playing
there's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime
and a song as sweet as a vesper chime
and the junes with the roses are staying
and the name of that isle is the long ago
and we bury our treasures there
there are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow
there are heaps of dust--but we love them so
there are trinkets and tresses of hair
there are fragments of song that nobody sings
and a part of an infant's prayer
there's a lute unswept, and a harp without strings
there are broken vows and pieces of rings
and the garments that she used to wear
there are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore
by the mirage is lifted in air
and we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar
sweet voices we heard in the days gone before
when the wind down the river is fair
oh, remembered for aye be the blessed isle
all the day of our life till night
when the evening comes with its beautiful smile
and our eyes are closing to slumber awhile
may that "greenwood" of soul be in sight
note: the last line of this poem needs explanation. "greenwood" is the
name of a cemetery in brooklyn, n.y. "greenwood of soul" means the
soul's resting place, or heaven
in an attic bare and cheerless, jim the newsboy dying lay
on a rough but clean straw pallet, at the fading of the day
scant the furniture about him but bright flowers were in the room
crimson phloxes, waxen lilies, roses laden with perfume
on a table by the bedside open at a well-worn page
where the mother had been reading lay a bible stained by age
now he could not hear the verses; he was flighty, and she wept
with her arms around her youngest, who close to her side had crept
blacking boots and selling papers, in all weathers day by day
brought upon poor jim consumption, which was eating life away
and this cry came with his anguish for each breath a struggle cost
papers, mister? morning papers?" then the cry fell to a moan
which was changed a moment later to another frenzied tone
it grows late, jack! night is coming. evening papers, here they are
soon a mission teacher entered, and approached the humble bed
then poor jim's mind cleared an instant, with his cool hand on his head
ma's been reading of the saviour, and through him i see my way
he is with me! jack, i charge you of our mother take good care
when jim's gone! hark! boots or papers, which will i be over there
black yer boots, sir? shine 'em right up! papers! read god's book instead
better'n papers that to die on! jack--" one gasp, and jim was dead
floating from that attic chamber came the teacher's voice in prayer
and it soothed the bitter sorrow of the mourners kneeling there
he commended them to heaven, while the tears rolled down his face
thanking god that jim had listened to sweet words of peace and grace
ever 'mid the want and squalor of the wretched and the poor
kind hearts find a ready welcome, and an always open door
for the sick are in strange places, mourning hearts are everywhere
and such need the voice of kindness, need sweet sympathy and prayer
break, break, break
on thy cold gray stones, o sea
and i would that my tongue could utter
the thoughts that arise in me
o well for the fisherman's boy
that he shouts with his sister at play
o well for the sailor lad
that he sings in his boat on the bay
and the stately ships go on
to their haven under the hill
but o for the touch of a vanished hand
and the sound of a voice that is still
break, break, break
at the foot of thy crags, o sea
but the tender grace of a day that is dead
will never come back to me
don't kill the birds, the pretty birds
that sing about your door
soon as the joyous spring has come
and chilling storms are o'er
the little birds, how sweet they sing
oh! let them joyous live
and never seek to take the life
that you can never give
don't kill the birds, the pretty birds
that play among the trees
should we dispense with these
the little birds, how fond they play
do not disturb their sport
but let them warble forth their songs
till winter cuts them short
don't kill the birds, the happy birds
that bless the fields and grove
so innocent to look upon
they claim our warmest love
the happy birds, the tuneful birds
how pleasant 'tis to see
no spot can be a cheerless place
where'er their presence be
i've got a letter, parson, from my son away out west
an' my old heart is heavy as an anvil in my breast
to think the boy whose future i had once so nicely planned
should wander from the right and come to such a bitter end
i told him when he left us, only three short years ago
he'd find himself a-plowing in a mighty crooked row
he'd miss his father's counsel and his mother's prayers, too
but he said the farm was hateful, an' he guessed he'd have to go
i know there's big temptations for a youngster in the west
but i believed our billy had the courage to resist
an' when he left i warned him of the ever waitin' snares
that lie like hidden serpents in life's pathway everywheres
but bill, he promised faithful to be careful, an' allowed
that he'd build a reputation that'd make us mighty proud
but it seems as how my counsel sort o' faded from his mind
and now he's got in trouble of the very worstest kind
his letters came so seldom that i somehow sort o' knowed
that billy was a-trampin' of a mighty rocky road
but never once imagined he would bow my head in shame
and in the dust would woller his old daddy's honored name
he writes from out in denver, an' the story's mighty short
i jess can't tell his mother!--it'll crush her poor old heart
an' so i reckoned, parson, you might break the news to her
bill's in the legislature but he doesn't say what fur
an old man going a lone highway
came, at the evening cold and gray
to a chasm vast and deep and wide
the old man crossed in the twilight dim
the sullen stream had no fear for him
but he turned when safe on the other side
and built a bridge to span the tide
your journey will end with the ending day
yon never again will pass this way
you've crossed the chasm, deep and wide
why build this bridge at evening tide
the builder lifted his old gray head
a youth whose feet must pass this way
this chasm that has been as naught to me
to that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be
he, too, must cross in the twilight dim
good friend, i am building this bridge for him
our band is few, but true and tried
our leader frank and bold
the british soldier trembles
when marion's name is told
our fortress is the good green wood
our tent the cypress tree
we know the forest round us
as seamen know the sea
we know its walls of thorny vines
its glades of reedy grass
its safe and silent islands
within the dark morass
woe to the english soldiery
that little dread us near
on them shall light at midnight
a strange and sudden fear
when, waking to their tents on fire
they grasp their arms in vain
and they who stand to face us
are beat to earth again
and they who fly in terror deem
a mighty host behind
and hear the tramp of thousands
upon the hollow wind
then sweet the hour that brings release
from danger and from toil
we talk the battle over
and share the battle's spoil
the woodland rings with laugh and shout
as if a hunt were up
and woodland flowers are gathered
to crown the soldier's cup
with merry songs we mock the wind
that in the pine-top grieves
and slumber long and sweetly
on beds of oaken leaves
well knows the fair and friendly moon
the band that marion leads
the glitter of their rifles
the scampering of their steeds
across the moonlight plains
that lifts their tossing manes
a moment in the british camp
a moment--and away
back to the pathless forest
before the peep of day
grave men there are by broad santee
grave men with hoary hairs
their hearts are all with marion
for marion are their prayers
and lovely ladies greet our band
with kindliest welcoming
with smiles like those of summer
and tears like those of spring
for them we wear these trusty arms
and lay them down no more
till we have driven the briton
forever from our shore
the minstrel-boy to the war is gone
in the ranks of death you'll find him
his father's sword he has girded on
and his wild harp slung behind him
one sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
one faithful harp shall praise thee
the minstrel fell!--but the foeman's chain
could not bring his proud soul under
the harp he loved ne'er spoke again
for he tore its chords asunder
and said, "no chains shall sully thee
thou soul of love and bravery
thy songs were made for the pure and free
they shall never sound in slavery
our old brown homestead reared its walls
from the wayside dust aloof
where the apple-boughs could almost cast
their fruitage on its roof
and the cherry-tree so near it grew
that when awake i've lain
in the lonesome nights, i've heard the limbs
as they creaked against the pane
and those orchard trees, o those orchard trees
i've seen my little brothers rocked
in their tops by the summer breeze
the sweet-brier under the window-sill
which the early birds made glad
and the damask rose by the garden fence
were all the flowers we had
i've looked at many a flower since then
exotics rich and rare
that to other eyes were lovelier
but not to me so fair
o those roses bright, o those roses bright
i have twined them with my sister's locks
that are hid in the dust from sight
we had a well, a deep old well
where the spring was never dry
and the cool drops down from the mossy stones
were falling constantly
and there never was water half so sweet
as that in my little cup
drawn up to the curb by the rude old sweep
which my father's hand set up
and that deep old well, o that deep old well
i remember yet the splashing sound
of the bucket as it fell
our homestead had an ample hearth
where at night we loved to meet
there my mother's voice was always kind
and her smile was always sweet
and there i've sat on my father's knee
and watched his thoughtful brow
with my childish hand in his raven hair
that hair is silver now
but that broad hearth's light, o that broad hearth's light
and my father's look, and my mother's smile
they are in my heart to-night
we were crowded in the cabin
not a soul would dare to sleep
it was midnight on the waters
and a storm was on the deep
to be shattered by the blast
and to hear the rattling trumpet
thunder, "cut away the mast
so we shuddered there in silence
for the stoutest held his breath
while the hungry sea was roaring
and the breakers talked with death
as thus we sat in darkness
each one busy with his prayers
as he staggered down the stairs
but his little daughter whispered
as she took his icy hand
just the same as on the land
then we kissed the little maiden
and we spoke in better cheer
and we anchored safe in harbor
when the morn was shining clear
whene'er a noble deed is wrought
whene'er is spoken a noble thought
our hearts, in glad surprise
to higher levels rise
the tidal wave of deeper souls
into our inmost being rolls
and lifts us unawares
out of all meaner cares
honor to those whose words or deeds
thus help us in our daily needs
and by their overflow
raise us from what is low
thus thought i, as by night i read
of the great army of the dead
the trenches cold and damp
the starved and frozen camp
the wounded from the battle-plain
in dreary hospitals of pain
the cheerless corridors
the cold and stony floors
lo! in that house of misery
a lady with a lamp i see
pass through the glimmering gloom
and flit from room to room
and slow, as in a dream of bliss
the speechless sufferer turns to kiss
her shadow, as it falls
upon the darkening walls
as if a door in heaven should be
opened and then closed suddenly
the vision came and went
the light shone and was spent
on england's annals, through the long
hereafter of her speech and song
that light its rays shall cast
from portals of the past
a lady with a lamp shall stand
in the great history of the land
a noble type of good
heroic womanhood
nor even shall be wanting here
the palm, the lily, and the spear
the symbols that of yore
saint filomena bore
the feast is o'er! now brimming wine
in lordly cup is seen to shine
before each eager guest
and silence fills the crowded hall
as deep as when the herald's call
thrills in the loyal breast
then up arose the noble host
and, smiling, cried: "a toast! a toast
to all our ladies fair
here before all, i pledge the name
of staunton's proud and beauteous dame
the ladye gundamere
then to his feet each gallant sprung
and joyous was the shout that rung
as stanley gave the word
and every cup was raised on high
nor ceased the loud and gladsome cry
till stanley's voice was heard
and lowly bent his haughty head
now each in turn must play his part
and pledge the lady of his heart
like gallant knight and true
then one by one each guest sprang up
and drained in turn the brimming cup
and named the loved one's name
and each, as hand on high he raised
his lady's grace or beauty praised
her constancy and fame
on him are fixed those countless eyes
a gallant knight is he
envied by some, admired by all
far famed in lady's bower and hall
the flower of chivalry
st. leon raised his kindling eye
and lifts the sparkling cup on high
deep graven on this grateful heart
till memory be dead
when lighter passions long have past
so holy 'tis and true
to one, whose love hath longer dwelt
more deeply fixed, more keenly felt
than any pledged by you
each guest upstarted at the word
and laid a hand upon his sword
with fury flashing eye
and stanley said: "we crave the name
proud knight, of this most peerless dame
whose love you count so high
st. leon paused, as if he would
not breathe her name in careless mood
thus lightly to another
then bent his noble head, as though
to give that word the reverence due
and gently said: "my mother
o for one hour of youthful joy
give back my twentieth spring
i'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy
than reign a gray-beard king
off with the spoils of wrinkled age
away with learning's crown
tear out life's wisdom-written page
and dash its trophies down
one moment let my life-blood stream
from boyhood's fount of flame
give me one giddy, reeling dream
of life all love and fame
my listening angel heard the prayer
and, calmly smiling, said
thy hasty wish hath sped
to bid thee fondly stay
while the swift seasons hurry back
to find the wished-for day
ah! truest soul of womankind
without thee what were life
one bliss i cannot leave behind
i'll take--my--precious--wife
the angel took a sapphire pen
and wrote in rainbow dew
and be a husband, too
before the change appears
remember, all their gifts have fled
with those dissolving years
my fond paternal joys
i could not bear to leave them all
i'll take--my--girl--and--boys
the smiling angel dropped his pen
the man would be a boy again
and be a father too
and so i laughed--my laughter woke
the household with its noise
and wrote my dream, when morning broke
to please the gray-haired boys
the bells of mount vernon are ringing to-day
and what say their melodious numbers
to the flag blooming air? list, what do they say
the world's monument stands the potomac beside
and what says the shaft to the river
death crowns him a hero forever
the bards crown the heroes and children rehearse
the songs that give heroes to story
and what say the bards to the children? "no verse
can yet measure washington's glory
and freedom shall triumph forever
and time must long wait the true song of his birth
who sleeps by the beautiful river
april! april! are you here
oh, how fresh the wind is blowing
see! the sky is bright and clear
oh, how green the grass is growing
april! april! are you here
april! april! is it you
see how fair the flowers are springing
sun is warm and brooks are clear
oh, how glad the birds are singing
april! april! is it you
april! april! you are here
though your smiling turn to weeping
though your skies grow cold and drear
though your gentle winds are sleeping
april! april! you are here
oh, such a commotion under the ground
when march called, "ho, there! ho
such spreading of rootlets far and wide
such whispering to and fro
and, "are you ready?" the snowdrop asked
then, "ha! ha! ha!" a chorus came
of laughter soft and low
from the millions of flowers under the ground
yes--millions--beginning to grow
o, the pretty brave things! through the coldest days
imprisoned in walls of brown
they never lost heart though the blast shrieked loud
and the sleet and the hail came down
but patiently each wrought her beautiful dress
or fashioned her beautiful crown
and now they are coming to brighten the world
still shadowed by winter's frown
and well may they cheerily laugh, "ha! ha
in a chorus soft and low
the millions of flowers hid under the ground
yes--millions--beginning to grow

down to the bay o' fundy
an' all i know is they was cried
in meetin' come nex' sunday
it was the twilight hour
behind the western hill the sun had sunk
leaving the evening sky aglow with crimson light
the air is filled with fragrance and with sound
high in the tops of shadowy vine-wreathed trees
grave parent-birds were twittering good-night songs
to still their restless brood
across the way
a noisy little brook made pleasant
music on the summer air
and farther on, the sweet, faint sound
of whippoorwill falls rose on the air, and fell
like some sweet chant at vespers
the air is heavy
with the scent of mignonette and rose
and from the beds of flowers the tall
white lilies point like angel fingers upward
casting on the air an incense sweet
that brings to mind the old, old story
of the alabaster box that loving mary
broke upon the master's feet
upon his vine-wreathed porch
an old white-headed man sits dreaming
happy, happy dreams of days that are no more
and listening to the quaint old song
with which his daughter lulled her child to rest
the darkness deepens
lord, with me abide
and as he listens to the sounds that fill the
summer air, sweet, dreamy thoughts
of his "lost youth" come crowding thickly up
and, for a while, he seems a boy again
with feet all bare
he wades the rippling brook, and with a boyish shout
gathers the violets blue, and nodding ferns
that wave a welcome from the other side
with those he wreathes
the sunny head of little nell, a neighbor's child
companion of his sorrows and his joys
sweet, dainty nell, whose baby life
seemed early linked with his
and whom he loved with all a boy's devotion
long years have flown
no longer boy and girl, but man and woman grown
they stand again beside the brook, that murmurs
ever in its course, nor stays for time nor man
and tell the old, old story
and promise to be true till life for them shall end
again the years roll on
and they are old. the frost of age
has touched the once-brown hair
and left it white as are the chaliced lilies
children, whose rosy lips once claimed
a father's blessing and a mother's love
have grown to man's estate, save two
whom god called early home to wait
for them in heaven
and then the old man thinks
how on a night like this, when faint
and sweet as half-remembered dreams
old whippoorwill falls did murmur soft
its evening psalms, when fragrant lilies
pointed up the way her christ had gone
god called the wife and mother home
and bade him wait
oh! why is it so hard for
man to wait? to sit with folded hands
apart, amid the busy throng
and hear the buzz and hum of toil around
to see men reap and bind the golden sheaves
of earthly fruits, while he looks idly on
and knows he may not join
but only wait till god has said, "enough
and calls him home
and thus the old man dreams
and then awakes; awakes to hear
the sweet old song just dying
on the pulsing evening air
and comforts flee
lord of the helpless
oh, abide with me
god said: i am tired of kings
i suffer them no more
up to my ear the morning brings
the outrage of the poor
think ye i have made this ball
a field of havoc and war
where tyrants great and tyrants small
might harry the weak and poor
my angel--his name is freedom
choose him to be your king
he shall cut pathways east and west
and fend you with his wing
i will never have a noble
no lineage counted great
fishers and choppers and plowmen
shall constitute a state
and ye shall succor man
help them who cannot help again
beware from right to swerve
the rosy clouds float overhead
the sun is going down
and now the sandman's gentle tread
comes stealing through the town
and, as he shakes his hand
straightway there lies on babies' eyes
his gift of shining sand
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town
from sunny beaches far away
yes, in another land
he gathers up, at break of day
his store of shining sand
no tempests beat that shore remote
no ships may sail that way
his little boat alone may float
within that lovely bay
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town
he smiles to see the eyelids close
above the happy eyes
and every child right well he knows
oh, he is very wise
but if, as he goes through the land
a naughty baby cries
his other hand takes dull gray sand
to close the wakeful eyes
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town
so when you hear the sandman's song
sound through the twilight sweet
be sure you do not keep him long
a-waiting in the street
lie softly down, dear little head
rest quiet, busy hands
till by your bed when good-night's said
he strews the shining sands
blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes and brown
as shuts the rose, they softly close
when he goes through the town
ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky
the flying cloud, the frosty light
the year is dying in the night
ring out, wild bells, and let him die
ring out the old, ring in the new
ring, happy bells, across the snow
the year is going, let him go
ring out the false, ring in the true
ring out the grief that saps the mind
for those that here we see no more
ring out the feud of rich and poor
ring in redress to all mankind
ring out a slowly dying cause
and ancient forms of party strife
ring in the nobler modes of life
with sweeter manners, purer laws
ring out false pride in place and blood
the civic slander and the spite
ring in the love of truth and right
ring in the common love of good
ring out old shapes of foul disease
ring out the narrowing lust of gold
ring out the thousand wars of old
ring in the thousand years of peace
ring in the valiant man and free
the larger heart, the kindlier hand
ring out the darkness of the land
ring in the christ that is to be
among the legends sung or said
along our rocky shore
the wishing bridge of marblehead
may well be sung once more
an hundred years ago (so ran
the old-time story) all
good wishes said above its span
would, soon or late, befall
if pure and earnest, never failed
the prayers of man or maid
for him who on the deep sea sailed
for her at home who stayed
once thither came two girls from school
and wished in childish glee
and one would be a queen and rule
and one the world would see
time passed; with change of hopes and fears
and in the selfsame place
two women, gray with middle years
stood wondering, face to face
with wakened memories, as they met
they queried what had been
said one, "i am a queen
where, lacking crown and throne
i rule by loving services
and patient toil alone
the other said: "the great world lies
beyond me as it laid
o'er love's and duty's boundaries
my feet have never strayed
its common sounds i hear
my widowed mother's sick-bed room
sufficeth for my sphere
of travel far and wide
and in a dreamy pilgrimage
we wander side by side
my book becomes to me
a magic glass: my watch i keep
but all the world i see
while fancy's privilege
is mine to walk the earth at will
thanks to the wishing bridge
the other cried, "and say
god gives the wishes of our youth
but in his own best way
these are the things i hold divine
a trusting chi id's hand laid in mine
rich brown earth and wind-tossed trees
the taste of grapes and the drone of bees
a rhythmic gallop, long june days
a rose-hedged lane and lovers' lays
the welcome smile on neighbors' faces
cool, wide hills and open places
breeze-blown fields of silver rye
the wild, sweet note of the plover's cry
fresh spring showers and scent of box
the soft, pale tint of the garden phlox
lilacs blooming, a drowsy noon
a flight of geese and an autumn moon
rolling meadows and storm-washed heights
a fountain murmur on summer nights
a dappled fawn in the forest hush
simple words and the song of a thrush
rose-red dawns and a mate to share
with comrade soul my gypsy fare
a waiting fire when the twilight ends
a gallant heart and the voice of friends
the bravest battle that ever was fought
shall i tell you where and when
on the map of the world you will find it not
nay, not with cannon or battle shot
with sword or nobler pen
nay, not with eloquent words or thought
from mouths of wonderful men
but deep in the walled-up woman's heart
of woman that would not yield
but bravely, silently, bore her part
lo, there is that battle field
no marshaling troup, no bivouac song
no banner to gleam or wave
but oh! these battles, they last so long
from babyhood to the grave
yet, faithful as a bridge of stars
she fights in her walled-up town
fights on and on in the endless wars
then, silent, unseen, goes down
oh, ye with banner and battle shot
and soldiers to shout and praise
i tell you the kingliest victories fought
were fought in those silent ways
oh, spotless in a world of shame
with splendid and silent scorn
go back to god as white as you came
the kingliest warrior born
what to a novice she could say
of courtship, love and matrimony
quoth echo plainly,--'matter-o'-money
a dashing damsel, gay and pert
a pattern of inconstancy
or selfish, mercenary flirt
quoth echo, sharply,--'nary flirt
that long has lured the dear deceiver
she promise to amend her life
and sin no more; can i believe her
quoth echo, very promptly;--'leave her
on me should venture to bestow it
pray should i act the wiser part
to take the treasure or forgo it
quoth echo, with decision,--'go it
to bind her fate in hymen's fetter
she vow she means to die a maid
in answer to my loving letter
quoth echo, rather coolly,--'let her
i find my heart entwined about
with cupid's dear, delicious chain
so closely that i can't get out
quoth echo, laughingly,--'get out
as pure and fair as heaven can make her
will share my labor and my rest
till envious death shall overtake her
quoth echo (sotto voce),-'take her
life! i know not what thou art
but know that thou and i must part
and when, or how, or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet
life! we've been long together
through pleasant and through cloudy weather
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear
then steal away; give little warning
choose thine own time
say not good night, but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning
in the hush and the lonely silence
of the chill october night
some wizard has worked his magic
with fairy fingers light
the leaves of the sturdy oak trees
are splendid with crimson and red
and the golden flags of the maple
are fluttering overhead
through the tangle of faded grasses
there are trailing vines ablaze
and the glory of warmth and color
gleams through the autumn haze
like banners of marching armies
that farther and farther go
down the winding roads and valleys
the boughs of the sumacs glow
so open your eyes, little children
and open your hearts as well
till the charm of the bright october
shall fold you in its spell
not who you are, but what you are
that's what the world demands to know
just what you are, what you can do
to help mankind to live and grow
your lineage matters not at all
nor counts one whit your gold or gear
what can you do to show the world
the reason for your being here
for just what space you occupy
the world requires you pay the rent
it does not shower its gifts galore
its benefits are only lent
and it has need of workers true
willing of hand, alert of brain
go forth and prove what you can do
nor wait to count o'er loss or gain
give of your best to help and cheer
the more you give the more you grow
this message evermore rings true
in time you reap whate'er you sow
no failure you have need to fear
except to fail to do your best
what have you done, what can you do
that is the question, that the test

down the valleys of hall
i hurry amain to reach the plain
run the rapid and leap the fall
split at the rock and together again

and flee from folly on every side
with a lover's pain to attain the plain
far from the hills of habersham
far from the valleys of hall
all down the hills of habersham
all through the valleys of hall
the rushes cried "abide, abide
the wilful waterweeds held me thrall
the laving laurel turned my tide
the ferns and the fondling grass said "stay

and the little reeds sighed "abide, abide

here in the valleys of hall
high o'er the hills of habersham
veiling the valleys of hall
the hickory told me manifold
fair tales of shade, the poplar tall
wrought me her shadowy self to hold
the chestnut, the oak, the walnut, the pine

these glades in the valleys of hall

the district school-master was sitting behind his great book-laden desk
close-watching the motions of scholars, pathetic and gay and grotesque
as whisper the half-leafless branches, when autumn's brisk breezes have
his little scrub-thicket of pupils sent upward a half-smothered hum
there was little tom timms on the front seat, whose face was withstanding
a drouth
and jolly jack gibbs just behind him, with a rainy new moon for a mouth
there were both of the smith boys, as studious as if they bore names that
could bloom
and jim jones, a heaven-built mechanic, the slyest young knave in the room
with a countenance grave as a horse's, and his honest eyes fixed on a pin
queer-bent on a deeply-laid project to tunnel joe hawkins's skin
there were anxious young novices, drilling their spelling-books into their
brain
loud-puffing each half-whispered letter, like an engine just starting its
train
there was one fiercely muscular fellow, who scowled at the sums on his
slate
and leered at the innocent figures a look of unspeakable hate
and set his white teeth close together, and gave his thin lips a short
twist
as to say, "i could whip you, confound you! could such things be done with
the fist
there were two knowing girls in the corner, each one with some beauty
possessed
in a whisper discussing the problem which one the young master likes best
a class in the front, with their readers, were telling, with difficult
pains
how perished brave marco bozzaris while bleeding at all of his veins
and a boy on the floor to be punished, a statue of idleness stood
making faces at all of the others, and enjoying the scene all he could
around were the walls, gray and dingy, which every old school-sanctum hath
with many a break on their surface, where grinned a wood-grating of lath
a patch of thick plaster, just over the school-master's rickety chair
seemed threat'ningly o'er him suspended, like damocles' sword, by a hair
there were tracks on the desks where the knife-blades had wandered in
search of their prey
their tops were as duskily spattered as if they drank ink every day
the square stove it puffed and it crackled, and broke out in red flaming
sores
till the great iron quadruped trembled like a dog fierce to rush
out-o'-doors
white snowflakes looked in at the windows; the gale pressed its lips to the
cracks
and the children's hot faces were streaming, the while they were freezing
their backs
now marco bozzaris had fallen, and all of his suff'rings were o'er
and the class to their seats were retreating, when footsteps were heard
at the door
and five of the good district fathers marched into the room in a row
and stood themselves up by the fire, and shook off their white cloaks of
and the spokesman, a grave squire of sixty, with countenance solemnly sad
spoke thus, while the children all listened, with all of the ears that
they had
concernin' complaints that's been entered, an' fault that has lately been
found
to pace off the width of your doin's, an' witness what you've been about
an' see if it's paying to keep you, or whether we'd best turn ye out
you give 'em too tight of a reinin', an' touch 'em up more than they need
you're nicer than wise in the matter of holdin' the book in one han
an' you turn a stray _g_ in their _doin's_, an' tack an odd _d
on their _an
there ain't no great good comes of speakin' the words so polite, as i see
providin' you know what the facts is, an' tell 'em off jest as they be
an' then there's that readin' in corncert, is censured from first unto
it kicks up a heap of a racket, when folks is a-travelin' past
whatever is done as to readin', providin' things go to my say
shan't hang on no new-fangled hinges, but swing in the old-fashioned way
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and nodded obliquely, and muttered: "them 'ere is my sentiments tew
that you turn the _u_ out o' your _labour_, an' make the word shorter
than 'tis
an' clip the _k_ off yer _musick_, which makes my son ephraim perplexed
an' when he spells out as he ought'r, you pass the word on to the next
they say there's some new-grafted books here that don't take them letters
along
but if it is so, just depend on 't, them new-grafted books is made wrong
you might just as well say that jackson didn't know all there was about
as to say that old spellin'-book webster didn't know what them letters was
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and scratched their heads slyly and softly, and said: "them's my sentiments
is that you have left tare an' tret out, an' also the old rule o' three
an' likewise brought in a new study, some high-steppin' scholars to please
with saw-bucks an' crosses and pothooks, an' _w's, x's, y's_ an' _z's
we ain't got no time for such foolin'; there ain't no great good to be
reached
by tiptoein' childr'n up higher than ever their fathers was teached
and the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was
and cocked one eye up to the ceiling, and said: "them's my sentiments tew
concernin' some things in the grammar you're teachin' our gals for to say
my gals is as steady as clockwork, and never give cause for much fear
but they come home from school t'other evenin' a-talking such stuff as this
an' 'they
an' they answered my questions: 'it's grammar'--'twas all i could get 'em
to say
now if, 'stead of doin' your duty, you're carryin' matters on so
as to make the gals say that they love you, it's just all that i want to
now jim, the young heaven-built mechanic, in the dusk of the evening
before
had well-nigh unjointed the stovepipe, to make it come down on the floor
and the squire bringing smartly his foot down, as a clincher to what he had
a joint of the pipe fell upon him, and larruped him square on the head
the soot flew in clouds all about him, and blotted with black all the place
and the squire and the other four fathers were peppered with black in the
the school, ever sharp for amusement, laid down all their cumbersome books
and, spite of the teacher's endeavors, laughed loud at their visitors
looks
and the squire, as he stalked to the doorway, swore oaths of a violet hue
and the four district fathers, who followed, seemed to say: "them's my
sentiments tew

the harp that once through tara's halls
the soul of music shed
now hangs as mute on tara's walls
as if that soul were fled
so sleeps the pride of former days
so glory's thrill is o'er
and hearts, that once beat high for praise
now feel that pulse no more
no more to chiefs and ladies bright
the harp of tara swells
the chord alone, that breaks at night
its tale of ruin tells
thus freedom now so seldom wakes
the only throb she gives
is when some heart indignant breaks
to show that still she lives
at paris it was, at the opera there
and she looked like a queen in a book that night
with the wreath of pearl in her raven hair
and the brooch on her breast so bright
of all the operas that verdi wrote
the best, to my taste, is the trovatore
and mario can soothe, with a tenor note
the souls in purgatory
the moon on the tower slept soft as snow
and who was not thrilled in the strangest way
as we heard him sing, while the gas burned low
the emperor there, in his box of state
looked grave, as if he had just then seen
the red flag wave from the city gate
where his eagles in bronze had been
the empress, too, had a tear in her eye
you'd have said that her fancy had gone back again
for one moment, under the old blue sky
to the old glad life in spain
well, there in our front-row box we sat
my gaze was fixed on my opera hat
and hers on the stage hard by
and both were silent, and both were sad
like a queen she leaned on her full white arm
with that regal, indolent air she had
so confident of her charm
i have not a doubt she was thinking then
of her former lord, good soul that he was
who died the richest and roundest of men
the marquis of carabas
i hope that, to get to the kingdom of heaven
through a needle's eye he had not to pass
i wish him well, for the jointure given
to my lady of carabas
meanwhile, i was thinking of my first love
as i had not been thinking of aught for years
till over my eyes there began to move
something that felt like tears
i thought of the dress that she wore last time
when we stood 'neath the cypress trees together
in that lost land, in that soft clime
in the crimson evening weather
of that muslin dress (for the eve was hot
and her warm white neck in its golden chain
and her full soft hair, just tied in a knot
and falling loose again
and the jasmine flower in her fair young breast
and the one bird singing alone to his nest
and the one star over the tower
i thought of our little quarrels and strife
and the letter that brought me back my ring
and it all seemed then, in the waste of life
such a very little thing
for i thought of her grave below the hill
which the sentinel cypress tree stands over
and i thought, "were she only living still
how i could forgive her and love her
and i swear, as i thought of her thus, in that hour
and of how, after all, old things are best
that i smelt the smell of that jasmine flower
which she used to wear in her breast
it smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet
it made me creep, and it made me cold
like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet
where a mummy is half unrolled
and i turned and looked: she was sitting there
in a dim box over the stage, and drest
in that muslin dress, with that full, soft hair
and that jasmine in her breast
i was here, and she was there
and the glittering horse-shoe curved between
from my bride betrothed, with her raven hair
and her sumptuous, scornful mien
to my early love, with her eyes downcast
and over her primrose face the shade
there was but a step to be made
to my early love from my future bride
one moment i looked. then i stole to the door
i traversed the passage; and down at her side
i was sitting, a moment more
my thinking of her or the music's strain
or something which never will be exprest
had brought her back from the grave again
with the jasmine in her breast
she is not dead, and she is not wed
but she loves me now, and she loved me then
and the very first word that her sweet lips said
my heart grew youthful again
the marchioness there, of carabas
she is wealthy, and young, and handsome still
and but for her--well, we'll let that pass
she may marry whomever she will
but i will marry my own first love
with her primrose face, for old things are best
and the flower in her bosom, i prize it above
the brooch in my lady's breast
the world is filled with folly and sin
and love must cling where it can, i say
for beauty is easy enough to win
but one isn't loved every day
and i think in the lives of most women and men
there's a moment when all would go smooth and even
if only the dead could find out when
to come back, and be forgiven
but oh the smell of that jasmine flower
and oh, that music! and oh, the way
that voice rang out from the donjon tower
i love my prairies, they are mine
from zenith to horizon line
clipping a world of sky and sod
like the bended arm and wrist of god
i love their grasses. the skies
are larger, and my restless eyes
fasten on more of earth and air
than seashore furnishes anywhere
i love the hazel thickets; and the breeze
the never resting prairie winds. the trees
that stand like spear points high
against the dark blue sky
are wonderful to me. i love the gold
of newly shaven stubble, rolled
a royal carpet toward the sun, fit to be
the pathway of a deity
i love the life of pasture lands; the songs of birds
are not more thrilling to me than the herd's
mad bellowing or the shadow stride
of mounted herdsmen at my side
i love my prairies, they are mine
from high sun to horizon line
the mountains and the cold gray sea
are not for me, are not for me
home they brought her warrior dead
she nor swoon'd, nor utter'd cry
all her maidens, watching, said
then they praised him, soft and low
call'd him worthy to be loved
truest friend and noblest foe
yet she neither spoke nor moved
stole a maiden from her place
lightly to the warrior stept
took the face-cloth from the face
yet she neither moved nor wept
rose a nurse of ninety years
set his child upon her knee
like summer tempest came her tears
sweet is the voice that calls
from babbling waterfalls
in meadows where the downy seeds are flying
and soft the breezes blow
and eddying come and go
in faded gardens where the rose is dying
among the stubbled corn
the blithe quail pipes at morn
the merry partridge drums in hidden places
and glittering insects gleam
above the reedy stream
where busy spiders spin their filmy laces
at eve, cool shadows fall
across the garden wall
and on the clustered grapes to purple turning
and pearly vapors lie
along the eastern sky
where the broad harvest-moon is redly burning
ah, soon on field and hill
the wind shall whistle chill
and patriarch swallows call their flocks together
to fly from frost and snow
and seek for lands where blow
the fairer blossoms of a balmier weather
the cricket chirps all day
the squirrel eyes askance the chestnuts browning
the wild fowl fly afar
above the foamy bar
and hasten southward ere the skies are frowning
now comes a fragrant breeze
through the dark cedar-trees
and round about my temples fondly lingers
in gentle playfulness
like to the soft caress
bestowed in happier days by loving fingers
yet, though a sense of grief
comes with the falling leaf
and memory makes the summer doubly pleasant
in all my autumn dreams
a future summer gleams
passing the fairest glories of the present
far back, in my musings, my thoughts have been cast
to the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed
i loved all its rooms from the pantry to hall
but the blessed old kitchen was dearer than all
its chairs and its tables no brighter could be
and all its surroundings were sacred to me
from the nail in the ceiling to the latch on the door
and i loved every crack in that old kitchen floor
i remember the fireplace with mouth high and wide
and the old-fashioned oven that stood by its side
out of which each thanksgiving came puddings and pies
and they fairly bewildered and dazzled our eyes
and then old st. nicholas slyly and still
came down every christmas our stockings to fill
but the dearest of memories laid up in store
is my mother a-sweeping that old kitchen floor
to-night those old musings come back at their will
but the wheel and its music forever are still
the band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away
and the fingers that turned it are mold'ring in clay
the hearthstone so sacred is just as 'twas then
and the voices of children ring out there again
the sun at the window looks in as of yore
but it sees other feet on that old kitchen floor
the night was dark when sam set out
to court old jones's daughter
he kinder felt as if he must
and kinder hadn't oughter
his heart against his waistcoat throbbed
his feelings had a tussle
which nearly conquered him despite
six feet of bone and muscle
the candle in the window shone
with a most doleful glimmer
and sam he felt his courage ooze
and through his fingers simmer
says he: "now, sam, don't be a fool
take courage, shaking doubter
go on, and pop the question right
for you can't live without her
but still, as he drew near the house
his knees got in a tremble
the beating of his heart ne'er beat
his efforts to dissemble
says he: "now, sam, don't be a goose
and let the female wimmin
knock all your thoughts a-skelter so
and set your heart a-swimmin
so sam, he kinder raised the latch
his courage also raising
and in a moment he sat inside
cid jones's crops a-praising
he tried awhile to talk the farm
in words half dull, half witty
not knowing that old jones well knew
his only thought was--kitty
at last the old folks went to bed
the joneses were but human
old jones was something of a man
and mrs. jones--a woman
and kitty she the pitcher took
and started for the cellar
it wasn't often that she had
so promising a feller
and somehow when she came upstairs
and sam had drank his cider
there seemed a difference in the chairs
and sam was close beside her
his stalwart arm dropped round her waist
her head dropped on his shoulder
and sam--well, he had changed his tune
and grown a trifle bolder
but this, if you live long enough
you surely will discover
there's nothing in this world of ours
except the loved and lover
the morning sky was growing gray
as sam the farm was leaving
his face was surely not the face
of one half grieved, or grieving
and kitty she walked smiling back
with blushing face, and slowly
there's something in the humblest love
that makes it pure and holy
and did he marry her, you ask
she stands there with the ladle
a-skimming of the morning's milk
that's sam who rocks the cradle
the north winds beat and clamor at the door
the drifted snow lies heaped along the street
swept by a blinding storm of hail and sleet
the clouded heavens no guiding starlight lend
but o'er the earth in gloom and darkness bend
gigantic shadows, by the night lamps thrown
dance their weird revels fitfully alone
in lofty halls, where fortune takes its ease
sunk in the treasures of all lands and seas
in happy homes, where warmth and comfort meet
the weary traveler with their smiles to greet
in lowly dwellings, where the needy swarm
round starving embers, chilling limbs to warm
rises the prayer that makes the sad heart light
but hark! above the beating of the storm
peals on the startled ear the fire alarm
yon gloomy heaven's aflame with sudden light
and heart-beats quicken with a strange affright
from tranquil slumbers springs, at duty's call
the ready friend no danger can appall
fierce for the conflict, sturdy, true, and brave
he hurries forth to battle and to save
from yonder dwelling, fiercely shooting out
devouring all they coil themselves about
the flaming furies, mounting high and higher
wrap the frail structure in a cloak of fire
strong arms are battling with the stubborn foe
in vain attempts their power to overthrow
with mocking glee they revel with their prey
defying human skill to check their way
and see! far up above the flame's hot breath
something that's human waits a horrid death
a little child, with waving golden hair
stands, like a phantom, 'mid the horrid glare
her pale, sweet face against the window pressed
while sobs of terror shake her tender breast
and from the crowd beneath, in accents wild
a mother screams, "o god! my child! my child
up goes a ladder. through the startled throng
a hardy fireman swiftly moves along
mounts sure and fast along the slender way
fearing no danger, dreading but delay
the stifling smoke-clouds lower in his path
sharp tongues of flame assail him in their wrath
but up, still up he goes! the goal is won
his strong arm beats the sash, and he is gone
gone to his death. the wily flames surround
and burn and beat his ladder to the ground
in flaming columns move with quickened beat
to rear a massive wall 'gainst his retreat
courageous heart, thy mission was so pure
suffering humanity must thy loss deplore
henceforth with martyred heroes thou shalt live
crowned with all honors nobleness can give
nay, not so fast; subdue these gloomy fears
behold! he quickly on the roof appears
bearing the tender child, his jacket warm
flung round her shrinking form to guard from harm
up with your ladders! quick! 'tis but a chance
behold, how fast the roaring flames advance
quick! quick! brave spirits, to his rescue fly
up! up! by heavens, this hero must not die
silence! he comes along the burning road
bearing, with tender care, his living load
aha! he totters! heaven in mercy save
the good, true heart that can so nobly brave
he's up again! and now he's coming fast
one moment, and the fiery ordeal's passed
and now he's safe! bold flames, ye fought in vain
a happy mother clasps her child again
one bright midsummer day
the gallant steamer ocean queen
swept proudly on her way
bright faces clustered on the deck
or, leaning o'er the side
watched carelessly the feathery foam
that flecked the rippling tide
ah, who beneath that cloudless sky
that smiling bends serene
could dream that danger, awful, vast
impended o'er the scene
could dream that ere an hour had sped
that frame of sturdy oak
would sink beneath the lake's blue waves
blackened with fire and smoke
a seaman sought the captain's side
a moment whispered low
the captain's swarthy face grew pale
he hurried down below
alas, too late! though quick, and sharp
and clear his orders came
no human efforts could avail
to quench th' insidious flame
the bad news quickly reached the deck
it sped from lip to lip
and ghastly faces everywhere
looked from the doomed ship
a hundred lips implore
a sailor, whose heroic soul
that hour should yet reveal
by name john maynard, eastern-born
stood calmly at the wheel
above the smothered roar
make for the nearest shore
no terror pales the helmsman's cheek
or clouds his dauntless eye
as, in a sailor's measured tone
his voice responds, "ay! ay
three hundred souls, the steamer's freight
crowd forward wild with fear
while at the stern the dreaded flames
above the deck appear
john maynard watched the nearing flames
but still with steady hand
he grasped the wheel, and steadfastly
he steered the ship to land
he heard the captain cry
a voice from out the stifling smoke
faintly responds, "ay! ay
but half a mile! a hundred hands
stretch eagerly to shore
but half a mile! that distance sped
peril shall all be o'er
but half a mile! yet stay, the flames
no longer slowly creep
but gather round that helmsman bold
with fierce, impetuous sweep
the captain cries once more
and we shall reach the shore
through flame and smoke that dauntless heart
responded firmly still
unawed, though face to face with death
the flames approach with giant strides
they scorch his hand and brow
one arm, disabled, seeks his side
ah! he is conquered now
but no, his teeth are firmly set
he crushes down his pain
his knee upon the stanchion pressed
he guides the ship again
one moment yet! one moment yet
brave heart, thy task is o'er
the pebbles grate beneath the keel
the steamer touches shore
three hundred grateful voices rise
in praise to god that he
hath saved them from the fearful fire
and from the engulfing sea
but where is he, that helmsman bold
the captain saw him reel
his nerveless hands released their task
he sank beside the wheel
the wave received his lifeless corse
blackened with smoke and fire
god rest him! never hero had
a nobler funeral pyre
piller fights is fun, i tell you
there isn't anything i'd rather do
than get a big piller and hold it tight
stand up in bed and then just fight
us boys allers have our piller fights
and the best night of all is pa's lodge night
soon as ever he goes, we say "good night
then go right upstairs for a piller fight
sometimes maybe ma comes to the stairs
and hollers up, "boys, have you said your prayers
and then george will holler "yes, mamma," for he always has
good deal of preacher about george, pa says
ma says "pleasant dreams," and shuts the door
if she's a-listenin' both of us snore
but as soon as ever she goes we light a light
and pitch right into our piller fight
we play that the bed is bunker hill
and george is americans, so he stands still
but i am the british, so i must hit
as hard as ever i can to make him git
we played buena vista one night
tell you, that was an awful hard fight
held up our pillers like they was a flag
an' hollered, "little more grape-juice, captain bragg
that was the night that george hit the nail
you just ought to have seen those feathers sail
i was covered as white as flour
me and him picked them up for 'most an hour
next day when our ma saw that there mess
she was pretty mad, you better guess
and she told our pa, and he just said
tell you, he whipped us till we were sore
and made us both promise to do it no more
that was a long time ago, and now lodge nights
or when pa's away we have piller fights
but in buena vista george is bound
to see there aren't any nails anywhere 'round
piller fights is fun, i tell you
there isn't anything i'd rather do
than get a big piller and hold it tight
stand up in bed, and then just fight

i sat alone with my conscience
in a place where time had ceased
and we talked of my former living
in the land where the years increased
and i felt i should have to answer
the question it might put to me
and to face the question and answer
throughout an eternity
the ghosts of forgotten actions
came floating before my sight
and things that i thought had perished
were alive with a terrible might
and the vision of life's dark record
was an awful thing to face
alone with my conscience sitting
in that solemnly silent place
and i thought of a far-away warning
of a sorrow that was to be mine
in a land that then was the future
but now is the present time
and i thought of my former thinking
of the judgment day to be
but sitting alone with my conscience
seemed judgment enough for me
and i wondered if there was a future
to this land beyond the grave
but no one gave me an answer
and no one came to save
then i felt that the future was present
and the present would never go by
for it was but the thought of a future
become an eternity
then i woke from my timely dreaming
and the vision passed away
and i knew the far-away warning
was a warning of yesterday
and i pray that i may not forget it
in this land before the grave
that i may not cry out in the future
and no one come to save
i have learned a solemn lesson
which i ought to have known before
and which, though i learned it dreaming
i hope to forget no more
so i sit alone with my conscience
in the place where the years increase
and i try to fathom the future
in the land where time shall cease
and i know of the future judgment
how dreadful soe'er it be
that to sit alone with my conscience
will be judgment enough for me
there's a dandy little fellow
who dresses all in yellow
in yellow with an overcoat of green
with his hair all crisp and curly
in the springtime bright and early
a-tripping o'er the meadow he is seen
through all the bright june weather
like a jolly little tramp
he wanders o'er the hillside, down the road
around his yellow feather
thy gypsy fireflies camp
his companions are the wood lark and the toad
but at last this little fellow
doffs his dainty coat of yellow
and very feebly totters o'er the green
for he very old is growing
and with hair all white and flowing
a-nodding in the sunlight he is seen
oh, poor dandy, once so spandy
golden dancer on the lea
older growing, white hair flowing
poor little baldhead dandy now is he
it's easy to talk of the patience of job, humph! job hed nothin' to try
ef he'd been married to 'bijah brown, folks wouldn't have dared come
nigh him
trials, indeed! now i'll tell you what--ef you want to be sick of your
jest come and change places with me a spell--for i'm an inventor's wife
and such inventions! i'm never sure, when i take up my coffee-pot
that 'bijah hain't been "improvin'" it and it mayn't go off like a shot
why, didn't he make me a cradle once, that would keep itself a-rockin
and didn't it pitch the baby out, and wasn't his head bruised shockin
and there was his "patent peeler," too--a wonderful thing, i'll say
but it hed one fault-it never stopped till the apple was peeled away
as for locks and clocks, and mowin' machines and reapers, and all such
trash
why, 'bijah's invented heaps of 'em but they don't bring in no cash
law! that don't worry him--not at all; he's the most aggravatin'est man
he'll set in his little workshop there, and whistle, and think, and plan
inventin' a jew's-harp to go by steam, or a new-fangled powder-horn
while the children's goin' barefoot to school and the weeds is chokin
our corn
when 'bijah and me kep' company, he warn't like this, you know
our folks all thought he was dreadful smart--but that was years ago
he was handsome as any pictur then, and he had such a glib, bright way
i never thought that a time would come when i'd rue my weddin' day
but when i've been forced to chop wood, and tend to the farm beside
and look at bijah a-settin' there, i've jest dropped down and cried
we lost the hull of our turnip crop while he was inventin' a gun
but i counted it one of my marcies when it bu'st before 'twas done
so he turned it into a "burglar alarm." it ought to give thieves a fright
sometimes i wonder if 'bijah's crazy, he does sech cur'ous things
hev i told you about his bedstead yit?--'twas full of wheels and springs
it hed a key to wind it up, and a clock face at the head
all you did was to turn them hands, and at any hour you said
that bed got up and shook itself, and bounced you on the floor
and then shet up, jest like a box, so you couldn't sleep any more
wa'al, 'bijah he fixed it all complete, and he sot it at half-past five
but he hadn't mor'n got into it when--dear me! sakes alive
them wheels began to whiz and whir! i heered a fearful snap
and there was that bedstead, with 'bijah inside, shet up jest like a trap
i screamed, of course, but 'twan't no use, then i worked that hull long
night
a-trying to open the pesky thing. at last i got in a fright
i couldn't hear his voice inside, and i thought he might be dyin
so i took a crow-bar and smashed it in.--there was 'bijah peacefully
inventin' a way to git out agin. that was all very well to say
but i don't b'lieve he'd have found it out if i'd left him in all day
now, sence i've told you my story, do you wonder i'm tired of life
or think it strange i often wish i warn't an inventor's wife
the snow and the silence came down together
through the night so white and so still
and young folks housed from the bitter weather
housed from the storm and the chill
heard in their dreams the sleigh-bells jingle
coasted the hill-sides under the moon
felt their cheeks with the keen air tingle
skimmed the ice with their steel-clad shoon
they saw the snow when they rose in the morning
glittering ghosts of the vanished night
though the sun shone clear in the winter dawning
and the day with a frosty pomp was bright
out in the clear, cold, winter weather
out in the winter air, like wine
kate with her dancing scarlet feather
bess with her peacock plumage fine
joe and jack with their pealing laughter
frank and tom with their gay hallo
and half a score of roisterers after
out in the witching, wonderful snow
shivering graybeards shuffle and stumble
righting themselves with a frozen frown
grumbling at every snowy tumble
but young folks know why the snow came down
closed eyes can't see the white roses
cold hands can't hold them, you know
breath that is stilled cannot gather
the odors that sweet from them blow
death, with a peace beyond dreaming
its children of earth doth endow
life is the time we can help them
so give them the flowers now
here are the struggles and striving
here are the cares and the tears
now is the time to be smoothing
the frowns and the furrows and fears
what to closed eyes are kind sayings
what to hushed heart is deep vow
naught can avail after parting
so give them the flowers now
just a kind word or a greeting
just a warm grasp or a smile
these are the flowers that will lighten
the burdens for many a mile
after the journey is over
what is the use of them; how
can they carry them who must be carried
oh, give them the flowers now
blooms from the happy heart's garden
plucked in the spirit of love
blooms that are earthly reflections
of flowers that blossom above
words cannot tell what a measure
of blessing such gifts will allow
to dwell in the lives of many
so give them the flowers now
some die too late and some too soon
at early morning, heat of noon
or the chill evening twilight. thou
whom the rich heavens did so endow
with eyes of power and jove's own brow
with all the massive strength that fills
thy home-horizon's granite hills
with rarest gifts of heart and head
from manliest stock inherited
new england's stateliest type of man
in port and speech olympian
whom no one met, at first, but took
a second awed and wondering look
on phidias' unveiled masterpiece
whose words, in simplest home-spun clad
the saxon strength of caedmon's had
with power reserved at need to reach
the roman forum's loftiest speech
sweet with persuasion, eloquent
in passion, cool in argument
or, ponderous, falling on thy foes
as fell the norse god's hammer blows
crushing as if with talus' flail
through error's logic-woven mail
and failing only when they tried
the adamant of the righteous side
thou, foiled in aim and hope, bereaved
of old friends, by the new deceived
too soon for us, too soon for thee
beside thy lonely northern sea
where long and low the marsh-lands spread
laid wearily down thy august head
thou shouldst have lived to feel below
thy feet disunion's fierce upthrow
the late-sprung mine that underlaid
thy sad concessions vainly made
thou shouldst have seen from sumter's wall
the star-flag of the union fall
and armed rebellion pressing on
the broken lines of washington
no stronger voice than thine had then
called out the utmost might of men
to make the union's charter free
and strengthen law by liberty
how had that stern arbitrament
to thy gray age youth's vigor lent
shaming ambition's paltry prize
before thy disillusioned eyes
breaking the spell about thee wound
like the green withes that samson bound
redeeming, in one effort grand
thyself and thy imperiled land
ah cruel fate, that closed to thee
o sleeper by the northern sea
the gates of opportunity
god fills the gaps of human need
each crisis brings its word and deed
wise men and strong we did not lack
but still, with memory turning back
in the dark hours we thought of thee
and thy lone grave beside the sea
above that grave the east winds blow
and from the marsh-lands drifting slow
the sea-fog comes, with evermore
the wave-wash of a lonely shore
and sea-bird's melancholy cry
as nature fain would typify
the sadness of a closing scene
the loss of that which should have been
but, where thy native mountains bare
their foreheads to diviner air
fit emblem of enduring fame
one lofty summit keeps thy name
for thee the cosmic forces did
the rearing of that pyramid
the prescient ages shaping with
fire, flood, and frost thy monolith
sunrise and sunset lay thereon
with hands of light their benison
the stars of midnight pause to set
their jewels in its coronet
and evermore that mountain mass
seems climbing from the shadowy pass
to light, as if to manifest
thy nobler self, they life at best
what flower is this that greets the morn
its hues from heaven so freshly born
with burning star and flaming band
it kindles all the sunset land
o tell us what its name may be
is this the flower of liberty
it is the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty
in savage nature's far abode
its tender seed our fathers sowed
the storm-winds rocked its swelling bud
its opening leaves were streaked with blood
till lo! earth's tyrants shook to see
the full-blown flower of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty
behold its streaming rays unite
one mingling flood of braided light
the red that fires the southern rose
with spotless white from northern snows
and, spangled o'er its azure, see
the sister stars of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty
the blades of heroes fence it round
where'er it springs is holy ground
from tower and dome its glories spread
it waves where lonely sentries tread
it makes the land as ocean free
and plants an empire on the sea
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty
thy sacred leaves, fair freedom's flower
shall ever float on dome and tower
to all their heavenly colors true
in blackening frost or crimson dew
and god love us as we love thee
thrice holy flower of liberty
then hail the banner of the free
the starry flower of liberty
little lamb, who made thee
dost thou know who made thee
gave thee life, and made thee feed
by the stream and o'er the mead
gave thee clothing of delight
softest clothing, woolly, bright
gave thee such a tender voice
making all the vales rejoice
little lamb, who made thee
dost thou know who made thee
little lamb, i'll tell thee
little lamb, i'll tell thee
he is called by thy name
for he calls himself a lamb
he is meek and he is mild
he became a little child
i a child, and thou a lamb
we are called by his name
little lamb, god bless thee
little lamb, god bless thee
from the lips of the soldier standing near
and "here" was the answer the next replied
this time no answer followed the call
only the rear man had seen him fall
killed or wounded he could not tell
there they stood in the failing light
these men of battle, with grave dark looks
as plain to be read as open books
while slowly gathered the shades of night
the fern on the hillside was splashed with blood
and down in the corn, where the poppies grew
were redder stains than the poppies knew
and crimson-dyed was the river's flood
two stalwart soldiers into the line
bearing between them herbert kline
wounded and bleeding, to answer his name
they were brothers, these two; the sad winds sighed
and a shudder crept through the cornfield near
just after the enemy wavered and broke
i paused a moment and gave him a drink
he murmured his mother's name i think
and death came with it and closed his eyes
for that company's roll when called that night
of a hundred men who went into the fight
numbered but twenty that answered "here
god send us a little home
to come back to when we roam
low walls and fluted tiles
wide windows, a view for miles
red firelight and deep chairs
small white beds upstairs
great talk in little nooks
dim colors, rows of books
one picture on each wall
not many things at all
god send us a little ground
tall trees standing round
homely flowers in brown sod
overhead, thy stars, o god
god bless, when winds blow
our home and all we know
no, comrades, i thank you--not any for me
my last chain is riven--henceforward i'm free
i will go to my home and my children to-night
with no fumes of liquor their spirits to blight
and, with tears in my eyes, i will beg my poor wife
to forgive me the wreck i have made of her life
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
just look at me now, boys, in rags and disgrace
with my bleared, haggard eyes, and my red, bloated face
mark my faltering step and my weak, palsied hand
and the mark on my brow that is worse than cain's brand
see my crownless old hat, and my elbows and knees
alike, warmed by the sun, or chilled by the breeze
why, even the children will hoot as i pass
but i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
you would hardly believe, boys, to look at me now
that a mother's soft hand was pressed on my brow
when she kissed me, and blessed me, her darling, her pride
ere she lay down to rest by my dead father's side
but with love in her eyes, she looked up to the sky
bidding me meet her there and whispered "good-bye
and i'll do it, god helping! your _smile_ i let pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
ah! i reeled home last night, it was not very late
for i'd spent my last sixpence, and landlords won't wait
on a fellow who's left every cent in their till
and has pawned his last bed, their coffers to fill
oh, the torments i felt, and the pangs i endured
and i begged for one glass--just one would have cured
but they kicked me out doors! i let that, too, pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
at home, my pet susie, with her rich golden hair
i saw through the window, just kneeling in prayer
from her pale, bony hands, her torn sleeves hung down
and her feet, cold and bare, shrank beneath her scant gown
and she prayed--prayed for _bread_, just a poor crust of bread
for one crust, on her knees my pet darling plead
and i heard, with no penny to buy one, alas
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
for susie, my darling, my wee six-year-old
though fainting with hunger and shivering with cold
there, on the bare floor, asked god to bless _me
and she said, "don't cry, mamma! he will; for you see
i _believe_ what i ask for!" then sobered, i crept
away from the house; and that night, when i slept
next my heart lay the pledge! you smile! let it pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
my darling child saved me! her faith and her love
are akin to my dear sainted mother's above
i will make my words true, or i'll die in the race
and sober i'll go to my last resting place
and she shall kneel there, and, weeping, thank god
no _drunkard_ lies under the daisy-strewn sod
not a drop more of poison my lips shall e'er pass
for i've drank my last glass, boys
i have drank my last glass
ye banks, and braes, and streams around
the castle o' montgomery
green be your woods, and fair your flowers
your waters never drumlie
there simmer first unfauld her robes
and there the langest tarry
for there i took the last fareweel
o' my sweet highland mary
how sweetly bloom'd the gay green birk
how rich the hawthorn's blossom
as, underneath their fragrant shade
i clasp'd her to my bosom
the golden hours, on angel wings
flew o'er me and my dearie
for dear to me as light and life
was my sweet highland mary
wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace
our parting was fu' tender
and, pledging aft to meet again
we tore oursels asunder
but, oh, fell death's untimely frost
that nipp'd my flower sae early
now green's the sod and cauld's the clay
that wraps my highland mary
oh, pale, pale now, those rosy lips
i aft ha'e kiss'd, sae fondly
and closed for aye the sparkling glance
that dwalt on me sae kindly
and mouldering now in silent dust
that heart that lo'ed me dearly
but still within my bosom's core
shall live my highland mary
little one, come to my knee
hark, how the rain is pouring
over the roof, in the pitch-black night
and the wind in the woods a-roaring
hush, my darling, and listen
then pay for the story with kisses
father was lost in the pitch-black night
in just such a storm as this is
high up on the lonely mountains
where the wild men watched and waited
wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush
and i on my path belated
the rain and the night together
came down, and the wind came after
bending the props of the pine-tree roof
and snapping many a rafter
i crept along in the darkness
stunned, and bruised, and blinded
crept to a fir with thick-set boughs
and a sheltering rock behind it
there, from the blowing and raining
crouching, i sought to hide me
something rustled, two green eyes shone
and a wolf lay down beside me
little one, be not frightened
i and the wolf together
side by side, through the long, long night
hid from the awful weather
his wet fur pressed against me
each of us warmed the other
each of us felt, in the stormy dark
that beast and man was brother
and when the falling forest
no longer crashed in warning
each of us went from our hiding-place
forth in the wild, wet morning
darling, kiss me in payment
hark, how the wind is roaring
father's house is a better place
when the stormy rain is pouring
she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamed upon my sight
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moment's ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilight's, too, her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn
a dancing shape, an image gay
to haunt, to startle, and way-lay
i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit, yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin-liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records, promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food
for transient sorrows, simple wiles
praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles
and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveler between life and death
the reason firm, the temperate will
endurance, foresight, strength, and skill
a perfect woman, nobly planned
to warn, to comfort, and command
and yet a spirit still, and bright
with something of angelic light
in may, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes
i found the fresh rhodora in the woods
spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook
to please the desert and the sluggish brook
the purple petals, fallen in the pool
made the black water with their beauty gay
here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool
and court the flower that cheapens his array
rhodora! if the sages ask thee why
this charm is wasted on the earth and sky
tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing
then beauty is its own excuse for being
why thou wert there, o rival of the rose
i never thought to ask, i never knew
but, in my simple ignorance, suppose
the self-same power that brought me there brought you
there was a boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs
and islands of winander!--many a time
at evening, when the earliest stars began
to move along the edges of the hills
rising or setting, would he stand alone
beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake
and there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
uplifted, he, as through an instrument
blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
that they might answer him,--and they would shout
across the watery vale, and shout again
responsive to his call,--with quivering peals
and long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
of jocund din! and, when there came a pause
of silence such as baffled his best skill
then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung
listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
has carried far into his heart the voice
of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
would enter unawares into his mind
with all its solemn imagery, its rocks
its woods, and that uncertain heaven received
into the bosom of the steady lake
this boy was taken from his mates, and died
in childhood, ere he was full twelve years old
pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
where he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs
upon a slope above the village-school
and through that church-yard when my way has led
on summer-evenings, i believe, that there
a long half-hour together i have stood
mute--looking at the grave in which he lies
on the top of the crumpetty tree
the quangle wangle sat
but his face you could not see
on account of his beaver hat
for his hat was a hundred and two feet wide
with ribbons and bibbons on every side
and bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace
so that nobody ever could see the face
of the quangle wangle quee
the quangle wangle said
to himself on the crumpetty tree
are the best of food for me
but the longer i live on this crumpetty tree
the plainer than ever it seems to me
that very few people come this way
and that life on the whole is far from gay
said the quangle wangle quee
but there came to the crumpetty tree
mr. and mrs. canary
and they said, "did ever you see
any spot so charmingly airy
may we build a nest on your lovely hat
mr. quangle wangle, grant us that
oh, please let us come and build a nest
of whatever material suits you best
mr. quangle wangle quee
and besides, to the crumpetty tree
came the stork, the duck, and the owl
the snail and the bumblebee
the frog and the fimble fowl
and all of them said, "we humbly beg
we may build our homes on your lovely hat
mr. quangle wangle, grant us that
mr. quangle wangle quee
and the golden grouse came there
and the pobble who has no toes
and the small olympian bear
and the dong with a luminous nose
and the blue baboon who played the flute
and the orient calf from the land of tute
and the attery squash, and the bisky bat
all came and built on the lovely hat
of the quangle wangle quee
and the quangle wangle said
to himself on the crumpetty tree
what a wonderful noise there'll be
and at night by the light of the mulberry moon
they danced to the flute of the blue baboon
on the broad green leaves of the crumpetty tree
and all were as happy as happy could be
with the quangle wangle quee
said the king to his daughters three
now say what shall they be
then up and spake the eldest daughter
that lady tall and grand
and gold rings for my hand
thereafter spake the second daughter
that was both white and red
and a gold comb for my head
then came the turn of the least daughter
that was whiter than thistle-down
and among the gold of her blithesome hair
dim shone the golden crown
and sang 'neath my bower eaves
till i dreamed, as his music made me
then the brow of the king swelled crimson
with a flush of angry scorn
and chosen as ye were born
that is happy binding the sheaves
then he saw her dead mother in her face
and said, "thou shalt have thy leaves
he mounted and rode three days and nights
till he came to vanity fair
and 'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk
but no singing leaves were there
then deep in the greenwood rode he
and asked of every tree
i pray you give it me
but the trees all kept their counsel
and never a word said they
only there sighed from the pine-tops
a music of seas far away
only the pattering aspen
made a sound of growing rain
that fell ever faster and faster
then faltered to silence again
that would win both hose and shoon
and will bring to me the singing leaves
if they grow under the moon
then lightly turned him walter the page
by the stirrup as he ran
of a king and gentleman
you meet at your castle-gate
and the princess shall get the singing leaves
or mine be a traitor's fate
the king's head dropt upon his breast
a moment, as it might be
then walter took from next his heart
a packet small and thin
the singing leaves are therein
as the king rode in at his castle-gate
a maiden to meet him ran
and "welcome, father!" she laughed and cried
together, the princess anne
she took the packet, and the smile
deepened down beneath the tear
it deepened down till it reached her heart
and then gushed up again
and lighted her tears as the sudden sun
transfigures the summer rain
and the first leaf, when it was opened
sang: "i am walter the page
and the songs i sing 'neath thy window
are my only heritage
and the second leaf sang: "but in the land
that is neither on earth nor sea
my lute and i are lords of more
than thrice this kingdom's fee
and the third leaf sang, "be mine! be mine
and ever it sang, "be mine
then sweeter it sang and ever sweeter
and said, "i am thine, thine, thine
at the first leaf she grew pale enough
at the second she turned aside
at the third,'twas as if a lily flushed
with a rose's red heart's tide
for they sing to my very heart," she said
she brought to him her beauty and truth
but and broad earldoms three
and he made her queen of the broader lands
he held of his lute in fee
never yet was a springtime
late though lingered the snow
that the sap stirred not at the whisper
of the south wind, sweet and low
never yet was a springtime
when the buds forgot to blow
ever the wings of the summer
are folded under the mold
life that has known no dying
is love's to have and to hold
till sudden, the burgeoning easter
the song! the green and the gold
farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness
this is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
the tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him
the third day comes a frost, a killing frost
and,--when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
his greatness is a-ripening,--nips his root
and then he falls, as i do. i have ventured
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
this many summers in a sea of glory
but far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
at length broke under me, and now has left me
weary, and old with service, to the mercy
of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me
vain pomp and glory of this world, i hate ye
i feel my heart new opened. o, how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours
there is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to
that sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
more pangs and fears than wars or women have
and when he falls, he falls like lucifer
never to hope again
want any papers, mister
wish you'd buy 'em of me
ten year old, an' a fam'ly
an' bizness dull, you see
fact, boss! there's tom, an' tibby
an' dad, an' mam, an' mam's cat
none on 'em earning money
what do you think of that
he's workin' for gov'ment now
they give him his board for nothin
all along of a drunken row
been there a year or so
so i'm taking care of the others
doing as well as i know
she's a kitten, a real maltee
i picked her up last summer
some boys was a drownin' of she
throw'd her inter a hogshead
but a p'liceman came along
so i jest grabbed up the kitten
and put for home, right strong
and tom's my dog; he an' tibby
hain't never quarreled yet
they sleep in my bed in winter
an' keeps me warm--you bet
mam's cat sleeps in the corner
with a piller made of her paw
can't she growl like a tiger
if anyone comes to our straw
what's a feller to do
some nights, when i'm tired an' hungry
seems as if each on 'em knew
they'll all three cuddle around me
till i get cheery, and say
well, p'raps i'll have sisters an' brothers
an' money an' clothes, too, some day
but if i do git rich, boss
said newsboys could be presidents
if only they acted right
so, if i was president, mister
the very first thing i'd do
i'd buy poor tom an' tibby
a dinner--an' mam's cat, too
none o' your scraps an' leavin's
but a good square meal for all three
if you think i'd skimp my friends, boss
that shows you don't know _me
so 'ere's your papers--come take one
gimme a lift if you can
for now you've heard my story
you see i'm a fam'ly man
not far advanced was morning day
when marmion did his troop array
to surrey's camp to ride
he had safe conduct for his band
beneath the royal seal and hand
and douglas gave a guide
the ancient earl, with stately grace
would clara on her palfrey place
and whispered in an undertone
the train from out the castle drew
but marmion stopped to bid adieu
sent hither by your king's behest
while in tantallon's towers i stayed
part we in friendship from your land
and, noble earl, receive my hand
but douglas round him drew his cloak
folded his arms, and thus he spoke
be open, at my sovereign's will
to each one whom he lists, howe'er
unmeet to be the owner's peer
my castles are my king's alone
from turret to foundation-stone
the hand of douglas is his own
and never shall in friendly grasp
the hand of such as marmion clasp
burned marmion's swarthy cheek like fire
and shook his very frame for ire
and--"this to me!" he said
such hand as marmion's had not spared
to cleave the douglas' head
and, first, i tell thee, haughty peer
he who does england's message here
even in thy pitch of pride
here in thy hold, thy vassals near
and lay your hands upon your sword
i tell thee thou'rt defied
and if thou said'st i am not peer
to any lord in scotland here
lowland or highland, far or near
lord angus, thou hast lied
on the earl's cheek the flush of rage
o'ercame the ashen hue of age
fierce he broke forth,--"and dar'st thou then
to beard the lion in his den
the douglas in his hall
and hop'st thou hence unscathed to go
no, by st. bride of bothwell, no
up drawbridge, grooms,--what, warder, ho
let the portcullis fall
lord marmion turned,--well was his need
and dashed the rowels in his steed
like arrow through the archway sprung
the ponderous grate behind him rung
to pass there was such scanty room
the bars, descending, razed his plume
the steed along the drawbridge flies
just as it trembled on the rise
not lighter does the swallow skim
along the smooth lake's level brim
and when lord marmion reached his band
he halts, and turns with clenched hand
and shout of loud defiance pours
and shook his gauntlet at the towers
but soon he reined his fury's pace
though most unworthy of the name
old age ne'er cools the douglas blood
i thought to slay him where he stood
i warrant him a warrior tried
with this his mandate he recalls
and slowly seeks his castle halls
han'som, stranger? yes, she's purty an' ez peart ez she kin be
clever? w'y! she ain't no chicken, but she's good enough for me
what's her name? 'tis kind o' common, yit i ain't ashamed to tell
she's ole "fiddler" filkin's daughter, an' her dad he calls her "nell
i wuz drivin' on the "central" jist about a year ago
on the run from winnemucca up to reno in washoe
there's no end o' skeery places. 'taint a road fur one who dreams
with its curves an' awful tres'les over rocks an' mountain streams
an' wuz tearin' up the mountain like a summer thunder-shower
round the bends an' by the ledges, 'bout ez fast ez we could go
with the mountain peaks above us an' the river down below
ez we come nigh to a tres'le 'crost a holler, deep an' wild
suddenly i saw a baby, 'twuz the station-keeper's child
toddlin' right along the timbers with a bold an' fearless tread
right afore the locomotive, not a hundred rods ahead
i jist jumped an' grabbed the throttle an' i fa'rly held my breath
fur i felt i couldn't stop her till the child wuz crushed to death
when a woman sprang afore me, like a sudden streak o' light
caught the boy, an' 'twixt the timbers in a second sank from sight
i jist whis'l'd all the brakes on. an' we worked with might an' main
till the fire flew from the drivers, but we couldn't stop the train
an' it rumbled on above her. how she screamed ez we rolled by
an' the river roared below us--i shall hear her till i die
then we stopt; the sun wuz shinin'; i ran back along the ridge
an' i found her--dead? no! livin'! she wuz hangin' to the bridge
where she dropt down thro' the crossties, with one arm about a sill
an' the other round the baby, who wuz yellin' fur to kill
so we saved 'em. she wuz gritty. she's ez peart ez she kin be
now we're married--she's no chicken, but she's good enough for me

she's my wife. ther' ain't none better than ole filkin's daughter "nell
a traveler on the dusty road
strewed acorns on the lea
and one took root and sprouted up
and grew into a tree
love sought its shade, at evening time
to breathe his early vows
and age was pleased, in heats of noon
to bask beneath its boughs
the dormouse loved its dangling twigs
the birds sweet music bore
it stood a glory in its place
a blessing evermore
a little spring had lost its way
amid the grass and fern
a passing stranger scooped a well
where weary men might turn
he walled it in, and hung with care
a ladle at the brink
he thought not of the deed he did
but judged that all might drink
he paused again, and lo! the well
by summer never dried
had cooled ten thousand parching tongues
and saved a life beside
a dreamer dropped a random thought
a simple fancy of the brain
but strong in being true
it shone upon a genial mind
and, lo! its light became
a lamp of life, a beacon ray
a monitory flame
the thought was small, its issue great
a watch-fire on the hill
it shed its radiance far adown
and cheers the valley still
a nameless man, amid a crowd
that thronged the daily mart
let fall a word of hope and love
unstudied from the heart
a whisper on the tumult thrown
a transitory breath
it raised a brother from the dust
it saved a soul from death
o germ! o fount! o word of love
o thought at random cast
ye were but little at the first
but mighty at the last
when the humid showers gather over all the starry spheres
and the melancholy darkness gently weeps in rainy tears
and listen to the patter of the soft rain overhead
every tinkle on the shingles has an echo in the heart
and a thousand dreamy fancies into busy being start
and a thousand recollections weave their bright hues into woof
as i listen to the patter of the soft rain on the roof
there in fancy comes my mother, as she used to years agone
to survey the infant sleepers ere she left them till the dawn
i can see her bending o'er me, as i listen to the strain
which is played upon the shingles by the patter of the rain
then my little seraph sister, with her wings and waving hair
and her bright-eyed, cherub brother--a serene, angelic pair
glide around my wakeful pillow with their praise or mild reproof
as i listen to the murmur of the soft rain on the roof
and another comes to thrill me with her eyes' delicious blue
i forget, as gazing on her, that her heart was all untrue
i remember that i loved her as i ne'er may love again
and my heart's quick pulses vibrate to the patter of the rain
there is naught in art's bravuras that can work with such a spell
in the spirit's pure, deep fountains, whence the holy passions swell
as that melody of nature, that subdued, subduing strain
which is played upon the shingles by the patter of the rain
the "bhisti," or water-carriers attached to regiments in india, is often
one of the most devoted subjects of the british crown, and he is much

you may talk o' gin an' beer
when you're quartered safe out 'ere

but if it comes to slaughter
you will do your work on water
an' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it
now in injia's sunny clime
where i used to spend my time
a-servin' of 'er majesty the queen
of all them black-faced crew
the finest man i knew
was our regimental _bhisti_, gunga din
he was "din! din! din
you limping lump o' brick-dust, gunga din
hi! _slippy hitherao
water, get it! _panee lao
you squidgy-nosed, old idol, gunga din
the uniform 'e wore
was nothin' much before
an' rather less than 'arf o' that be'ind
for a twisty piece o' rag
an' a goatskin water bag
was all the field-equipment 'e could find
when the sweatin' troop-train lay
in a sidin' through the day
where the 'eat would make your bloomin' eyebrows crawl
we shouted "harry by
till our throats were bricky-dry
then we wopped 'im 'cause 'e couldn't serve us all
it was "din! din! din
you 'eathen, where the mischief 'ave you been
you put some _juldee_ in it
or i'll _marrow_ you this minute
if you don't fill up my helmet, gunga din
till the longest day was done
an' 'e didn't seem to know the use o' fear
if we charged or broke or cut
you could bet your bloomin' nut
with 'is _mussick_ on 'is back
an' watch us till the bugles made "retire
an' for all 'is dirty 'ide
when 'e went to tend the wounded under fire
it was "din! din! din

when the cartridges ran out
you could 'ear the front-files shout

when i dropped be'ind the fight
with a bullet where my belt-plate should 'a' been

will ye give it up to slaves
will ye look for greener graves
hope ye mercy still
what's the mercy despots feel

read it on yon bristling steel
ask it--ye who will
fear ye foes who kill for hire
will ye to your homes retire
look behind you! they're afire
and, before you, see
who have done it! from the vale
on they come! and will ye quail
leaden rain and iron hail
let their welcome be
in the god of battles trust
die we may--and die we must
but, o where can dust to dust
be consigned so well
as where heaven its dews shall shed
on the martyred patriot's bed
and the rocks shall raise their head
of his deeds to tell
why dost thou wildly rush and roar
mad river, o mad river
wilt thou not pause and cease to pour
thy hurrying, headlong waters o'er
this rocky shelf forever
what secret trouble stirs thy breast
why all this fret and flurry
dost thou not know that what is best
in this too restless world is rest
from overwork and worry
what wouldst thou in these mountains seek
o stranger from the city
is it perhaps some foolish freak
of thine, to put the words i speak
into a plaintive ditty
yes; i would learn of thee thy song
with all its flowing numbers
and in a voice as fresh and strong
as thine is, sing it all day long
and hear it in my slumbers
a brooklet nameless and unknown
was i at first, resembling
a little child, that all alone
comes venturing down the stairs of stone
irresolute and trembling
later, by wayward fancies led
for the wide world i panted
out of the forest dark and dread
across the open fields i fled
like one pursued and haunted
i tossed my arms, i sang aloud
my voice exultant blending
with thunder from the passing cloud
the wind, the forest bent and bowed
the rush of rain descending
i heard the distant ocean call
imploring and entreating
drawn onward, o'er this rocky wall
i plunged, and the loud waterfall
made answer to the greeting
and now, beset with many ills
a toilsome life i follow
compelled to carry from the hills
these logs to the impatient mills
below there in the hollow
yet something ever cheers and charms
the rudeness of my labors
daily i water with these arms
the cattle of a hundred farms
and have the birds for neighbors
men call me mad, and well they may
when, full of rage and trouble
i burst my banks of sand and clay
and sweep their wooden bridge away
like withered reeds or stubble
now go and write thy little rhyme
as of thine own creating
thou seest the day is past its prime
i can no longer waste my time
the mills are tired of waiting
when papa was a little boy you really couldn't find
in all the country round about a child so quick to mind
his mother never called but once, and he was always there
he never made the baby cry or pulled his sister's hair
he never slid down banisters or made the slightest noise
and never in his life was known to fight with other boys
he always rose at six o'clock and went to bed at eight
and never lay abed till noon; and never sat up late
he finished latin, french and greek when he was ten year old
and knew the spanish alphabet as soon as he was told
he never, never thought of play until his work was done
he labored hard from break of day until the set of sun
he never scraped his muddy shoes upon the parlor floor
and never answered, back his ma, and never banged the door
i looked at john,--john looked at me
as well as though my locks were jet
and when i found that i must speak
my voice seemed strangely low and weak
and then i listening bent my head
a house and land while you shall live
if, in return, from out your seven
one child to me for aye is given
i looked at john's old garments worn
i thought of all that john had borne
of poverty, and work, and care
which i, though willing, could not share
of seven hungry mouths to feed
of seven little children's need
and then of this
asleep"; so walking hand in hand
dear john and i surveyed our band
first to the cradle lightly stepped
where lilian, the baby, slept
her damp curls lay, like gold alight
a glory 'gainst the pillow white
softly her father stooped to lay
his rough hand down in loving way
when dream or whisper made her stir
and huskily he said, "not _her
we stooped beside the trundle-bed
and one long ray of lamp-light shed
athwart the boyish faces there
in sleep so pitiful and fair
i saw on jamie's rough red cheek
a tear undried; ere john could speak
and kissed him as we hurried by
pale, patient robby's angel face
still in his sleep bore suffering's trace
he whispered, while our eyes were dim
poor dick! sad dick! our wayward son
turbulent, reckless, idle one
could _he_ be spared? "nay, he who gave
bids us befriend him to the grave
only a mother's heart can be
patient enough for such as he
and so," said john, "i would not dare
to send him from her bedside prayer
then stole we softly up above
and knelt by mary, child of love
i said to john. quite silently
he lifted up a curl, that lay
across her cheek in wilful way
and shook his head; "nay, love, not thee
the while my heart beat audibly
only one more, our eldest lad
trusty and truthful, good and glad
so like his father: "no, john, no
i cannot, will not, let him go
and so we wrote, in courteous way
we could not give one child away
and afterward toil lighter seemed
thinking of that of which we dreamed
happy, in truth, that not one face
we missed from its accustomed place
thankful to work for all the seven
trusting then to one in heaven
it was a starry night in june, the air was soft and still
when the "minute-men" from cambridge came, and gathered on the hill
beneath us lay the sleeping town, around us frowned the fleet
but the pulse of freemen, not of slaves, within our bosoms beat
and every heart rose high with hope, as fearlessly we said
the trench is marked, the tools are brought, we utter not a word
but stack our guns, then fall to work with mattock and with spade
a thousand men with sinewy arms, and not a sound is made
so still were we, the stars beneath, that scarce a whisper fell
we heard the red-coat's musket click, and heard him cry, "all's well
see how the morn, is breaking; the red is in the sky
the mist is creeping from the stream that floats in silence by
the "lively's" hall looms through the fog, and they our works have spied
for the ruddy flash and round-shot part in thunder from her side
and the "falcon" and the "cerberus" make every bosom thrill
with gun and shell, and drum and bell, and boatswain's whistle shrill
but deep and wider grows the trench, as spade and mattock ply
for we have to cope with fearful odds, and the time is drawing nigh
up with the pine-tree banner! our gallant prescott stands
amid the plunging shells and shot, and plants it with his hands
up with the shout! for putnam comes upon his reeking bay
with bloody spur and foaming bit, in haste to join the fray
but thou whose soul is glowing in the summer of thy years
unvanquishable warren, thou, the youngest of thy peers
wert born and bred, and shaped and made, to act a patriot's part
and dear to us thy presence is as heart's blood to the heart
hark! from the town a trumpet! the barges at the wharf
are crowded with the living freight; and now they're pushing off
with clash and glitter, trump and drum, in all its bright array
behold the splendid sacrifice move slowly o'er the bay
and still and still the barges fill, and still across the deep
like thunder clouds along the sky, the hostile transports sweep
and now they're forming at the point; and now the lines advance
we see beneath the sultry sun their polished bayonets glance
we hear anear the throbbing drum, the bugle-challenge ring
quick bursts and loud the flashing cloud, and rolls from wing to wing
but on the height our bulwark stands, tremendous in its gloom
as sullen as a tropic sky, and silent as a tomb
and so we waited till we saw, at scarce ten rifles' length
the old vindictive saxon spite, in all its stubborn strength
when sudden, flash on flash, around the jagged rampart burst
from every gun the livid light upon the foe accursed
then quailed a monarch's might before a free-born people's ire
then drank the sward the veteran's life, where swept the yeoman's fire
then, staggered by the shot, he saw their serried columns reel
and fall, as falls the bearded rye beneath the reaper's steel
and then arose a mighty shout that might have waked the dead
and every man hath dropped his gun to clutch a neighbor's hand
as his heart kept praying all the while for home and native land
thrice on that day we stood the shock of thrice a thousand foes
and thrice that day within our lines the shout of victory rose
and though our swift fire slackened then, and, reddening in the skies
we saw from charlestown's roofs and walls the flamy columns rise
yet while we had a cartridge left, we still maintained the fight
nor gained the foe one foot of ground upon that blood-stained height
what though for us no laurels bloom, and o'er the nameless brave
no sculptured trophy, scroll, nor hatch records a warrior grave
what though the day to us was lost!--upon that deathless page
the everlasting charter stands for every land and age
for man hath broke his felon bonds, and cast them in the dust
and claimed his heritage divine, and justified the trust
while through his rifted prison-bars the hues of freedom pour
o'er every nation, race and clime, on every sea and shore
such glories as the patriarch viewed, when, mid the darkest skies
he saw above a ruined world the bow of promise rise
we squander health in search of wealth
we scheme and toil and save
then squander wealth in search of health
but only find a grave
we live, and boast of what we own
we die, and only get a stone
it may be that the words i spoke
to cheer him on his way
to him were vain, but i myself
was braver all that day
billy's dead, and gone to glory--so is billy's sister nell
there's a tale i know about them, were i poet i would tell
soft it comes, with perfume laden, like a breath of country air
wafted down the filthy alley, bringing fragrant odors there
in that vile and filthy alley, long ago one winter's day
dying quick of want and fever, hapless, patient billy lay
while beside him sat his sister, in the garret's dismal gloom
cheering with her gentle presence billy's pathway to the tomb
many a tale of elf and fairy did she tell the dying child
till his eyes lost half their anguish, and his worn, wan features smiled
tales herself had heard haphazard, caught amid the babel roar
lisped about by tiny gossips playing round their mothers' door
then she felt his wasted fingers tighten feebly as she told
how beyond this dismal alley lay a land of shining gold
where, when all the pain was over,--where, when all the tears were shed
he would be a white-frocked angel, with a gold thing on his head
then she told some garbled story of a kind-eyed saviour's love
how he'd built for little children great big playgrounds up above
where they sang and played at hopscotch and at horses all the day
and where beadles and policemen never frightened them away
this was nell's idea of heaven,--just a bit of what she'd heard
with a little bit invented, and a little bit inferred
but her brother lay and listened, and he seemed to understand
for he closed his eyes and murmured he could see the promised land
oh, the children look so happy and they're all so strong and well
i can see them there with jesus--he is playing with them, too
let as run away and join them, if there's room for me and you
she was eight, this little maiden, and her life had all been spent
in the garret and the alley, where they starved to pay the rent
where a drunken father's curses and a drunken mother's blows
drove her forth into the gutter from the day's dawn to its close
but she knew enough, this outcast, just to tell this sinking boy
you must die," she whispered, "billy, and i am not even ill
but i'll come to you, dear brother,--yes, i promise that i will
i heard father say to mother that he knew you couldn't last
they will put you in a coffin, then you'll wake and be up there
while i'm left alone to suffer in this garret bleak and bare
gentle jesus will not beat me; he's not cruel or unkind
but i can't help thinking, nelly, i should like to take away
something, sister, that you gave me, i might look at every day
to a great green lovely meadow, where we played and ran about
and the van that took us halted by a sweet bright patch of land
where the fine red blossoms grew, dear, half as big as mother's hand
those
and he told me, i remember, that the pretty name was rose
i have never seen them since, dear--how i wish that i had one
just to keep and think of you, nell, when i'm up beyond the sun
not a word said little nelly; but at night, when billy slept
on she flung her scanty garments and then down the stairs she crept
through the silent streets of london she ran nimbly as a fawn
running on and running ever till the night had changed to dawn
when the foggy sun had risen, and the mist had cleared away
all around her, wrapped in snowdrift, there the open country lay
she was tired, her limbs were frozen, and the roads had cut her feet
but there came no flowery gardens her poor tearful eyes to greet
she had traced the road by asking, she had learnt the way to go
she had found the famous meadow--it was wrapped in cruel snow
not a buttercup or daisy, not a single verdant blade
showed its head above its prison. then she knelt her down and prayed
with her eyes upcast to heaven, down she sank upon the ground
and she prayed to god to tell her where the roses might be found
then the cold blast numbed her senses, and her sight grew strangely dim
and a sudden, awful tremor seemed to seize her every limb
and as she prayed a chariot came thundering down the hill
and a lady sat there, toying with a red rose, rare and sweet
as she passed she flung it from her, and it fell at nelly's feet
just a word her lord had spoken caused her ladyship to fret
and the rose had been his present, so she flung it in a pet
but the poor, half-blinded nelly thought it fallen from the skies
and she murmured, "thank you, jesus!" as she clasped the dainty prize
lo! that night from but the alley did a child's soul pass away
from dirt and sin and misery up to where god's children play
lo! that night a wild, fierce snowstorm burst in fury o'er the land
and at morn they found nell frozen, with the red rose in her hand
billy's dead, and gone to glory--so is billy's sister nell
am i bold to say this happened in the land where angels dwell
that the children met in heaven, after all their earthly woes
and that nelly kissed her brother, and said, "billy, here's your rose
mine is a wild, strange story,--the strangest you ever heard
there are many who won't believe it, but it's gospel, every word
it's the biggest drama of any in a long, adventurous life
the scene was a ship, and the actors--were myself and my new-wed wife
you musn't mind if i ramble, and lose the thread now and then
i'm old, you know, and i wander--it's a way with old women and men
for their lives lie all behind them, and their thoughts go far away
and are tempted afield, like children lost on a summer day
the years must be five-and-twenty that have passed since that awful night
but i see it again this evening, i can never shut out the sight
we were only a few weeks married, i and the wife, you know
when we had an offer for melbourne, and made up our minds to go
we'd acted together in england, traveling up and down
with a strolling band of players, going from town to town
we played the lovers together--we were leading lady and gent
and at last we played in earnest, and straight to the church we went
the parson gave us his blessing, and i gave nellie the ring
and swore that i'd love and cherish, and endow her with everything
how we smiled at that part of the service when i said "i thee endow
but as to the "love and cherish," i meant to keep that vow
we were only a couple of strollers; we had coin when the show was good
when it wasn't we went without it, and we did the best we could
we were happy, and loved each other, and laughed at the shifts we made
where love makes plenty of sunshine, there poverty casts no shade
well, at last we got to london, and did pretty well for a bit
then the business dropped to nothing, and the manager took a flit
stepped off one sunday morning, forgetting the treasury call
but our luck was in, and we managed right on our feet to fall
we got an offer for melbourne,--got it that very week
those were the days when thousands went over to fortune seek
the days of the great gold fever, and a manager thought the spot
good for a "spec," and took us as actors among his lot
we hadn't a friend in england--we'd only ourselves to please
and we jumped at the chance of trying our fortune across the seas
we went on a sailing vessel, and the journey was long and rough
we hadn't been out a fortnight before we had had enough
but use is a second nature, and we'd got not to mind a storm
when misery came upon us,--came in a hideous form
my poor little wife fell ailing, grew worse, and at last so bad
that the doctor said she was dying,--i thought 'twould have sent me mad
dying where leagues of billows seemed to shriek for their prey
and the nearest land was hundreds--aye, thousands--of miles away
she raved one night in a fever, and the next lay still as death
so still i'd to bend and listen for the faintest sign of breath
she seemed in a sleep, and sleeping, with a smile on her thin, wan face
she passed away one morning, while i prayed to the throne of grace
i knelt in the little cabin, and prayer after prayer i said
till the surgeon came and told me it was useless--my wife was dead
dead! i wouldn't believe it. they forced me away that night
for i raved in my wild despairing, the shock sent me mad outright
i was shut in the farthest cabin, and i beat my head on the side
and all day long in my madness, "they've murdered her!" i cried
they locked me away from my fellows,--put me in cruel chains
it seems i had seized a weapon to beat out the surgeon's brains
i cried in my wild, mad fury, that he was a devil sent
to gloat o'er the frenzied anguish with which my heart was rent
i spent that night with the irons heavy upon my wrists
and my wife lay dead quite near me. i beat with my fettered fists
beat at my prison panels, and then--o god!--and then
i heard the shrieks of women and the tramp of hurrying men
i heard the cry, "ship afire!" caught up by a hundred throats
and over the roar the captain shouting to lower the boats
then cry upon cry, and curses, and the crackle of burning wood
and the place grew hot as a furnace, i could feel it where i stood
i beat at the door and shouted, but never a sound came back
and the timbers above me started, till right through a yawning crack
i could see the flames shoot upward, seizing on mast and sail
fanned in their burning fury by the breath of the howling gale
i dashed at the door in fury, shrieking, "i will not die
die in this burning prison!"--but i caught no answering cry
then, suddenly, right upon me, the flames crept up with a roar
and their fiery tongues shot forward, cracking my prison door
i was free--with the heavy iron door dragging me down to death
i fought my way to the cabin, choked with the burning breath
of the flames that danced around me like man-mocking fiends at play
and then--o god! i can see it, and shall to my dying day
there lay my nell as they'd left her, dead in her berth that night
the flames flung a smile on her features,--a horrible, lurid light
god knows how i reached and touched her, but i found myself by her side
i thought she was living a moment, i forgot that my nell had died
in the shock of those awful seconds reason came back to my brain
i heard a sound as of breathing, and then a low cry of pain
oh, was there mercy in heaven? was there a god in the skies
the dead woman's lips were moving, the dead woman opened her eyes
i cursed like a madman raving--i cried to her, "nell! my nell
they had left us alone and helpless, alone in that burning hell
they had left us alone to perish--forgotten me living--and she
had been left for the fire to bear her to heaven, instead of the sea
i clutched at her, roused her shrieking, the stupor was on her still
i seized her in spite of my fetters,--fear gave a giant's will
god knows how i did it, but blindly i fought through the flames and the
wreck
up--up to the air, and brought her safe to the untouched deck
we'd a moment of life together,--a moment of life, the time
for one last word to each other,--'twas a moment supreme, sublime
from the trance we'd for death mistaken, the heat had brought her to life
and i was fettered and helpless, so we lay there, husband and wife
it was but a moment, but ages seemed to have passed away
when a shout came over the water, and i looked, and lo, there lay
right away from the vessel, a boat that was standing by
they had seen our forms on the vessel, as the flames lit up the sky
i shouted a prayer to heaven, then called to my wife, and she
tore with new strength at my fetters--god helped her, and i was free
then over the burning bulwarks we leaped for one chance of life
did they save us? well, here i am, sir, and yonder's my dear old wife
we were out in the boat till daylight, when a great ship passing by
took us on board, and at melbourne landed us by and by
we've played many parts in dramas since we went on that famous trip
but ne'er such a scene together as we had on the burning ship
a sad-faced little fellow sits alone in deep disgrace
there's a lump arising in his throat, tears streaming down his face
he wandered from his playmates, for he doesn't want to hear
their shouts of merry laughter, since the world has lost its cheer
he has sipped the cup of sorrow, he has drained the bitter glass
and his heart is fairly breaking; he's the boy who didn't pass
in the apple tree the robin sings a cheery little song
but he doesn't seem to hear it, showing plainly something's wrong
comes his faithful little spaniel for a romp and bit of play
but the troubled little fellow sternly bids him go away
all alone he sits in sorrow, with his hair a tangled mass
and his eyes are red with weeping; he's the boy who didn't pass
how he hates himself for failing, he can hear his playmates jeer
for they've left him with the dullards--gone ahead a half a year
and he tried so hard to conquer, oh, he tried to do his best
but now he knows, he's weaker, yes, and duller than the rest
he's ashamed to tell his mother, for he thinks she'll hate him, too
the little boy who didn't pass, who failed of getting through
oh, you who boast a laughing son, and speak of him as bright
and you who love a little girl who comes to you at night
with smiling eyes, with dancing feet, with honors from her school
turn to that lonely little boy who thinks he is a fool
and take him kindly by the hand, the dullest in his class
he is the one who most needs love, the boy who didn't pass
yes, it's a quiet station, but it suits me well enough
i want a bit of the smooth now, for i've had my share o' rough
this berth that the company gave me, they gave as the work was light
i was never fit for the signals after one awful night
i'd been in the box from a younker, and i'd never felt the strain
of the lives at my right hand's mercy in every passing train
one day there was something happened, and it made my nerves go queer
and it's all through that as you find me the station-master here
i was on at the box down yonder--that's where we turn the mails
and specials, and fast expresses, on to the center rails
the side's for the other traffic--the luggage and local slows
it was rare hard work at christmas, when double the traffic grows
i've been in the box down yonder nigh sixteen hours a day
till my eyes grew dim and heavy, and my thoughts went all astray
but i've worked the points half-sleeping--and once i slept outright
till the roar of the limited woke me, and i nearly died with fright
then i thought of the lives in peril, and what might have been their fate
had i sprung to the points that evening a tenth of a tick too late
and a cold and ghastly shiver ran icily through my frame
as i fancied the public clamor, the trial, and bitter shame
i could see the bloody wreckage--i could see the mangled slain
and the picture was seared for ever, blood-red, on my heated brain
that moment my nerve was shattered, for i couldn't shut out the thought
of the lives i held in my keeping, and the ruin that might be wrought
that night in our little cottage, as i kissed our sleeping child
my wife looked up from her sewing, and told me, as she smiled
that johnny had made his mind up--he'd be a pointsman, too
i frowned, for my heart was heavy, and my wife she saw the look
lord bless you! my little alice could read me like a book
i'd to tell her of what had happened, and i said that i must leave
for a pointsman's arm ain't trusty when terror lurks in his sleeve
but she cheered me up in a minute, and that night, ere we went to sleep
she made me give her a promise, which i swore that i'd always keep
it was always to do my duty. "do that, and then, come what will
you'll have no worry." said alice, "if things go well or ill
there's something that always tells us the thing that we ought to do
my wife was a bit religious, and in with the chapel crew
now, the very next day the missus had to go to the market town
she'd the christmas things to see to, and she wanted to buy a gown
she'd be gone for a spell, for the parley didn't come back till eight
and i knew, on a christmas eve, too, the trains would be extra late
so she settled to leave me johnny, and then she could turn the key
for she'd have some parcels to carry, and the boy would be safe with me
he was five, was our little johnny, and quiet, and nice, and good
he was mad to go with daddy, and i'd often promised he should
it was noon when the missus started,--her train went by my box
she could see, as she passed my window, her darling's curly locks
i lifted him up to mammy, and he kissed his little hand
then sat, like a mouse, in the corner, and thought it was fairyland
but somehow i fell a-thinking of a scene that would not fade
of how i had slept on duty, until i grew afraid
for the thought would weigh upon me, one day i might come to lie
in a felon's cell for the slaughter of those i had doomed to die
the fit that had come upon me, like a hideous nightmare seemed
till i rubbed my eyes and started like a sleeper who has dreamed
for a time the box had vanished--i'd worked like a mere machine
my mind had been on the wander, and i'd neither heard nor seen
with a start i thought of johnny, and i turned the boy to seek
then i uttered a groan of anguish, for my lips refused to speak
there had flashed such a scene of horror swift on my startled sight
that it curdled my blood in terror and sent my red lips white
it was all in one awful moment--i saw that the boy was lost
he had gone for a toy, i fancied, some child from a train had tossed
the local was easing slowly to stop at the station here
and the limited mail was coming, and i had the line to clear
i could hear the roar of the engine, i could almost feel its breath
and right on the center metals stood my boy in the jaws of death
on came the fierce fiend, tearing straight for the center line
and the hand that must wreck or save it, o merciful god, was mine
up to god's ear that moment a wild, fierce question flew
on the wind came the words, "your duty," borne to my listening ear
then i set my teeth, and my breathing was fierce and short and quick
the hot black smoke of the engine came with a rush before
i turned the mail to the center, and by it flew with a roar
then i sank on my knees in horror, and hid my ashen face
i had given my child to heaven; his life was a hundred's grace
had i held my hand a moment, i had hurled the flying mail
to shatter the creeping local that stood on the other rail
where is my boy, my darling? o god! let me hide my eyes
how can i look--his father--on that which there mangled lies
that voice!--o merciful heaven!--'tis the child's, and he calls my name
i hear, but i cannot see him, for my eyes are filled with flame
i knew no more that night, sir, for i fell, as i heard the boy
the place reeled round, and i fainted,--swooned with the sudden joy
but i heard on the christmas morning, when i woke in my own warm bed
with alice's arms around me, and a strange wild dream in my head
that she'd come by the early local, being anxious about the lad
and had seen him there on the metals, and the sight nigh drove her mad
she had seen him just as the engine of the limited closed my view
and she leapt on the line and saved him just as the mail dashed through
she was back in the train in a second, and both were safe and sound
the moment they stopped at the station she ran here, and i was found
with my eyes like a madman's glaring, and my face a ghastly white
i heard the boy, and i fainted, and i hadn't my wits that night
who told me to do my duty? what voice was that on the wind
was it fancy that brought it to me? or were there god's lips behind
if i hadn't 'a' done my duty--had i ventured to disobey
my bonny boy and his mother might have died by my hand that day
hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings
and phoebus 'gins arise
his steeds to water at those springs
on chaliced flowers that lies
and winking mary-buds begin
to ope their golden eyes
with every thing that pretty is
my lady sweet, arise
arise, arise
in a dark and dismal alley where the sunshine never came
dwelt a little lad named tommy, sickly, delicate, and lame
he had never yet been healthy, but had lain since he was born
dragging out his weak existence well nigh hopeless and forlorn
he was six, was little tommy, 'twas just five years ago
since his drunken mother dropped him, and the babe was crippled so
he had never known the comfort of a mother's tender care
but her cruel blows and curses made his pain still worse to bear
there he lay within the cellar, from the morning till the night
starved, neglected, cursed, ill-treated, nought to make his dull life
bright
not a single friend to love him, not a loving thing to love
for he knew not of a saviour, or a heaven up above
tommy's little heart was sinking, and he felt so lonely, till
floating up the quiet alley, wafted inwards from the street
came the sound of some one singing, sounding, oh! so clear and sweet
eagerly did tommy listen as the singing came
oh! that he could see the singer! how he wished he wasn't lame
then he called and shouted loudly, till the singer heard the sound
and on noting whence it issued, soon the little cripple found
all her garments torn and ragged, her appearance far from neat
most folks call me singing jessie; wot may your name chance to be
for it makes me feel so happy--sing me something, anything
jessie laughed, and answered smiling, "i can't stay here very long
but i'll sing a hymn to please you, wot i calls the 'glory song
then she sang to him of heaven, pearly gates, and streets of gold
where the happy angel children are not starved or nipped with cold
but where happiness and gladness never can decrease or end
and where kind and loving jesus is their sovereign and their friend
oh! how tommy's eyes did glisten as he drank in every word
as it fell from "singing jessie"--was it true, what he had heard
and so anxiously he asked her, "is there really such a place
and a tear began to trickle down his pallid little face
and if yer will love the saviour, yer shall go there when yer die
when i'm down in this 'ere cellar, and he's up in heaven above
so the little ragged maiden who had heard at sunday school
all about the way to heaven, and the christian's golden rule
taught the little cripple tommy how to love, and how to pray
then she sang a "song of jesus," kissed his cheek and went away
tommy lay within the cellar which had grown so dark and cold
thinking all about the children in the streets of shining gold
and he heeded not the darkness of that damp and chilly room
for the joy in tommy's bosom could disperse the deepest gloom
so he put his hands together, and he closed his little eyes
and in accents weak, yet earnest, sent this message to the skies
that yer cared for little cripples who is weak and very poor
and i never heard of heaven till that jessie came to-day
and told me all about it, so i wants to try and pray
and i somehow must believe it, for it seems so prime and good
and she told me if i loved you, i should see yer when i die
in the bright and happy heaven that is up beyond the sky
for i heard my mother whisper, she'd be glad if i could go
and i'm cold and hungry sometimes; and i feel so lonely, too
can't yer take me, gentle jesus, up to heaven along o' you
and your kindness to me, jesus, i would surely not forget
i would love you all i know of, and would never make a noise
can't you find me just a corner, where i'll watch the other boys
for i feel so glad and happy, and i do so want to go
how i long to see yer, jesus, and the children all so bright
come and fetch me, won't yer, jesus? come and fetch me home tonight
tommy ceased his supplication, he had told his soul's desire
and he waited for the answer till his head began to tire
then he turned towards his corner and lay huddled in a heap
closed his little eyes so gently, and was quickly fast asleep
oh, i wish that every scoffer could have seen his little face
as he lay there in the corner, in that damp, and noisome place
for his countenance was shining like an angel's, fair and bright
and it seemed to fill the cellar with a holy, heavenly light
he had only heard of jesus from a ragged singing girl
he might well have wondered, pondered, till his brain began to whirl
but he took it as she told it, and believed it then and there
simply trusting in the saviour, and his kind and tender care
in the morning, when the mother came to wake her crippled boy
she discovered that his features wore a look of sweetest joy
and she shook him somewhat roughly, but the cripple's face was cold
he had gone to join the children in the streets of shining gold
tommy's prayer had soon been answered, and the angel death had come
to remove him from his cellar, to his bright and heavenly home
where sweet comfort, joy, and gladness never can decrease or end
and where jesus reigns eternally, his sovereign and his friend
it was a bright and lovely summer's morn
fair bloomed the flowers, the birds sang softly sweet
the air was redolent with perfumed balm
and nature scattered, with unsparing hand
her loveliest graces over hill and dale
an artist, weary of his narrow room
within the city's pent and heated walls
had wandered long amid the ripening fields
until, remembering his neglected themes
he thought to turn his truant steps toward home
these led him through a rustic, winding lane
lined with green hedge-rows spangled close with flowers
and overarched by trees of noblest growth
but when at last he reached the farther end
of this sweet labyrinth, he there beheld
a vision of such pure, pathetic grace
that weariness and haste were both obscured
it was a child--a young and lovely child
with eyes of heavenly hue, bright golden hair
and dimpled hands clasped in a morning prayer
kneeling beside its youthful mother's knee
upon that baby brow of spotless snow
no single trace of guilt, or pain, or woe
no line of bitter grief or dark despair
of envy, hatred, malice, worldly care
had ever yet been written. with bated breath
and hand uplifted as in warning, swift
the artist seized his pencil, and there traced
in soft and tender lines that image fair
then, when 'twas finished, wrote beneath one word
a word of holiest import--innocence
years fled and brought with them a subtle change
scattering time's snow upon the artist's brow
but leaving there the laurel wreath of fame
while all men spake in words of praise his name
for he had traced full many a noble work
upon the canvas that had touched men's souls
and drawn them from the baser things of earth
toward the light and purity of heaven
one day, in tossing o'er his folio's leaves
he chanced upon the picture of the child
which he had sketched that bright morn long before
and then forgotten. now, as he paused to gaze
a ray of inspiration seemed to dart
straight from those eyes to his. he took the sketch
placed it before his easel, and with care
that seemed but pleasure, painted a fair theme
touching and still re-touching each bright lineament
until all seemed to glow with life divine
the artist could not pause. he needs must have
a meet companion for his fairest theme
and so he sought the wretched haunts of sin
through miry courts of misery and guilt
seeking a face which at the last was found
within a prison cell there crouched a man
nay, rather say a fiend--with countenance seamed
and marred by all the horrid lines of sin
each mark of degradation might be traced
and every scene of horror he had known
and every wicked deed that he had done
were visibly written on his lineaments
even the last, worst deed of all, that left him here
a parricide within a murderer's cell
here then the artist found him; and with hand
made skillful by its oft-repeated toil
transferred unto his canvas that vile face
and also wrote beneath it just one word
a word of darkest import--it was vice
then with some inspiration not his own
thinking, perchance, to touch that guilty heart
and wake it to repentance e'er too late
the artist told the tale of that bright morn
placed the two pictured faces side by side
and brought the wretch before them. with a shriek
that echoed through those vaulted corridors
like to the cries that issue from the lips
of souls forever doomed to woe
prostrate upon the stony floor he fell
and hid his face and groaned aloud in anguish
in the gracious years forever fled
that innocent and happy little child
these very hands were raised to god in prayer
that now are reddened with a mother's blood
great heaven! can such things be? almighty power
send forth thy dart and strike me where i lie
he rose, laid hold upon the artist's arm
and grasped it with demoniac power
the while he cried: "go forth, i say, go forth
and tell my history to the tempted youth
i looked upon the wine when it was red
i heeded not my mother's piteous prayers
i heeded not the warnings of my friends
but tasted of the wine when it was red
until it left a demon in my heart
that led me onward, step by step, to this
this horrible place from which my body goes
unto the gallows, and my soul to hell
he ceased as last. the artist turned and fled
but even as he went, unto his ears
were borne the awful echoes of despair
which the lost wretch flung on the empty air
cursing the demon that had brought him there
there are two kinds of people on earth to-day
just two kinds of people, no more, i say
not the sinner and saint, for it's well understood
the good are half bad and the bad are half good
not the rich and the poor, for to rate a man's wealth
you must first know the state of his conscience and health
not the humble and proud, for in life's little span
who puts on vain airs is not counted a man
not the happy and sad, for the swift flying years
bring each man his laughter and each man his tears
no; the two kinds of people on earth i mean
are the people who lift and the people who lean
wherever you go, you will find the earth's masses
are always divided in just these two classes
and, oddly enough, you will find, too, i ween
there's only one lifter to twenty who lean
in which class are you? are you easing the load
of overtaxed lifters, who toil down the road
or are you a leaner, who lets others share
your portion of labor, and worry and care
it isn't the thing you do, dear
it's the thing you leave undone
that gives you a bit of a heartache
at the setting of the sun
the tender word forgotten
the letter you did not write
the flowers you did not send, dear
are your haunting ghosts at night
the stone you might have lifted
out of a brother's way
the bit of hearthstone counsel
you were hurried too much to say
the loving touch of the hand, dear
the gentle, winning tone
which you had no time nor thought for
with troubles enough of your own
those little acts of kindness
so easily out of mind
those chances to be angels
which we poor mortals find
they come in night and silence
each sad, reproachful wraith
when hope is faint and flagging
and a chill has fallen on faith
for life is all too short, dear
and sorrow is all too great
to suffer our slow compassion
that tarries until too late
and it isn't the thing you do, dear
it's the thing you leave undone
which gives you a bit of a heartache
at the setting of the sun
give me that grand old volume, the gift of a mother's love
tho' the spirit that first taught me has winged its flight above
yet, with no legacy but this, she has left me wealth untold
yea, mightier than earth's riches, or the wealth of ophir's gold
when a child, i've kneeled beside her, in our dear old cottage home
and listened to her reading from that prized and cherished tome
as with low and gentle cadence, and a meek and reverent mien
god's word fell from her trembling lips, like a presence felt and seen
solemn and sweet the counsels that spring from its open page
written with all the fervor and zeal of  the prophet age
full of the inspiration of the holy bards who trod
caring not for the scoffer's scorn, if they gained a soul to god
men who in mind were godlike, and have left on its blazoned scroll
food for all coming ages in its manna of the soul
who, through long days of anguish, and nights devoid of ease
still wrote with the burning pen of faith its higher mysteries
i can list that good man yonder, in the gray church by the brook
take up that marvelous tale of love, of the story and the book
how through the twilight glimmer, from the earliest dawn of time
it was handed down as an heirloom, in almost every clime
how through strong persecution and the struggle of evil days
the precious light of the truth ne'er died, but was fanned to a beacon
blaze
how in far-off lands, where the cypress bends o'er the laurel bough
it was hid like some precious treasure, and they bled for its truth, as
he tells how there stood around it a phalanx none could break
though steel and fire and lash swept on, and the cruel wave lapt the stake
how dungeon doors and prison bars had never damped the flame
but raised up converts to the creed whence christian comfort came
that housed in caves and caverns--how it stirs our scottish blood
the convenanters, sword in hand, poured forth the crimson flood
and eloquent grows the preacher, as the sabbath sunshine falls
thro' cobwebbed and checkered pane, a halo on the walls
that still 'mid sore disaster, in the heat and strife of doubt
some bear the gospel oriflamme, and one by one march out
till forth from heathen kingdoms, and isles beyond the sea
the glorious tidings of the book spread christ's salvation free
so i cling to my mother's bible, in its torn and tattered boards
as one of the greatest gems of art, and the king of all other hoards
as in life the true consoler, and in death ere the judgment call
the guide that will lead to the shining shore, where the father waits
for all
this poem was read by edwin markham at the dedication of the lincoln
memorial at washington, d.c., may 30, 1922. before reading, he said: "no
oration, no poem, can rise to the high level of this historic hour
nevertheless, i venture to inscribe this revised version of my lincoln
poem to this stupendous lincoln memorial, to this far-shining monument
of remembrance, erected in immortal marble to the honor of our deathless
martyr--the consecrated statesman, the ideal american, the ever-beloved
friend of humanity
when the norn mother saw the whirlwind hour
greatening and darkening as it hurried on
she left the heaven of heroes and came down
to make a man to meet the mortal need
she took the tried clay of the common road
clay warm yet with the genial heat of earth
dasht through it all a strain of prophecy
tempered the heap with thrill of human tears
then mixt a laughter with the serious stuff
into the shape she breathed a flame to light
that tender, tragic, ever-changing face
and laid on him a sense of the mystic powers
moving--all husht--behind the mortal veil
here was a man to hold against the world
a man to match the mountains and the sea
the color of the ground was in him, the red earth
the smack and tang of elemental things
the rectitude and patience of the cliff
the good-will of the rain that loves all leaves
the friendly welcome of the wayside well
the courage of the bird that dares the sea
the gladness of the wind that shakes the corn
the pity of the snow that hides all scars
the secrecy of streams that make their way
under the mountain to the rifted rock
the tolerance and equity of light
that gives as freely to the shrinking flower
as to the great oak flaring to the wind
to the grave's low hill as to the matterhorn
that shoulders out the sky. sprung from the west
he drank the valorous youth of a new world
the strength of virgin forests braced his mind
the hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul
his words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts
were roots that firmly gript the granite truth
up from log cabin to the capitol
one fire was on his spirit, one resolve
to send the keen ax to the root of wrong
clearing a free way for the feet of god
the eyes of conscience testing every stroke
to make his deed the measure of a man
he built the rail-pile as he built the state
pouring his splendid strength through every blow
the grip that swung the ax in illinois
was on the pen that set a people free
so came the captain with the mighty heart
and when the judgment thunders split the house
wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest
he held the ridgepole up, and spikt again
the rafters of the home. he held his place
held the long purpose like a growing tree
held on through blame and faltered not at praise
and when he fell in whirlwind, he went down
as when a lordly cedar, green with boughs
goes down with a great shout upon the hills
and leaves a lonesome place against the sky
if i had known in the morning
how wearily all the day
the words unkind
would trouble my mind
i said when you went away
i had been more careful, darling
nor given you needless pain
but we vex "our own
with look and tone
we may never take back again
for though in the quiet evening
you may give me the kiss of peace
yet it might be
that never for me
the pain of the heart should cease
how many go forth in the morning
that never come home at night
and hearts have broken
for harsh words spoken
that sorrow can ne'er set right
we have careful thoughts for the stranger
and smiles for the sometime guest
but oft for "our own
the bitter tone
though we love "our own" the best
ah, lips with the curve impatient
ah, brow with that look of scorn
were the night too late
to undo the work of morn
the gate was thrown open, i rode out alone
more proud than a monarch, who sits on a throne
i am but a jockey, but shout upon shout
went up from the people who watched me ride out
and the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd
were as earnest as those to which monarch e'er bowed
my heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain
as i patted my salvator's soft, silken mane
and a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand
as we passed by the multitude down to the stand
the great wave of cheering came billowing back
as the hoofs of brave tenny ran swift down the track
and he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle
our noble opponent, well trained for the tussle
that waited us there on the smooth, shining course
my salvator, fair to the lovers of horse
as a beautiful woman is fair to man's sight
pure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright
stood taking the plaudits as only his due
and nothing at all unexpected or new
and then there before us as the bright flag is spread
there's a roar from the grand stand, and tenny's ahead
at the sound of the voices that shouted, "a go
he sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow
i tighten the reins on prince charlie's great son
he is off like a rocket, the race is begun
half-way down the furlong their heads are together
scarce room 'twixt their noses to wedge in a feather
past grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife
ah, salvator, boy, 'tis the race of your life
i press my knees closer, i coax him, i urge
i feel him go out with a leap and a surge
i see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride
while backward, still backward, falls tenny beside
we are nearing the turn, the first quarter is passed
the distance elongates; still tenny sweeps on
as graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn
his awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained
a noble opponent well born and well trained
i glanced o'er my shoulder; ha! tenny! the cost
of that one second's flagging will be--the race lost
one second's yielding of courage and strength
and the daylight between us has doubled its length
the first mile is covered, the race is mine--no
for the blue blood of tenny responds to a blow
he shoots through the air like a ball from a gun
and the two lengths between us are shortened to one
my heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump
for tenny's long neck is at salvator's rump
and now with new courage grown bolder and bolder
i see him once more running shoulder to shoulder
with knees, hands and body i press my grand steed
i urge him, i coax him, i pray him to heed
o salvator! salvator! list to my calls
for the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls
there's a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm
as close to the saddle leaps tenny's great form
one mighty plunge, and with knee, limb and hand
i lift my horse first by a nose past the stand
we are under the string now--the great race is done
and salvator, salvator, salvator won
cheer, hoary-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, i say
though ye live twice the space that's allotted to men
ye never will see such a grand race again
let the shouts of the populace roar like the surf
for salvator, salvator, king of the turf
he has rivaled the record of thirteen long years
he has won the first place in the vast line of peers
and even his enemies grant him his place
down into the dust let old records be hurled
and hang out 2:05 to the gaze of the world
i'd like to hunt the injuns 't roam the boundless plain
i'd like to be a pirate an' plow the ragin' main
an' capture some big island, in lordly pomp to rule
but i just can't be nothin' cause i got to go to school
the least amount o' learnin' by a flickerin' pitch pine knot
an' many a darin' boy like me grows up to be a fool
an' never 'mounts to nothin' 'cause he's got to go to school
i'd like to be a cowboy an' rope the texas steer
i'd like to be a sleuth-houn' or a bloody buccaneer
an' leave the foe to welter where their blood had made a pool
but how can i git famous? 'cause i got to go to school
i don't see how my parents kin make the big mistake
o' keepin' down a boy like me 'at's got a name to make
it ain't no wonder boys is bad, an' balky as a mule
life ain't worth livin' if you've got to waste your time in school
i'd like to be regarded as "the terror of the plains
i'd like to hear my victims shriek an' clank their prison chains
i'd like to face the enemy with gaze serene an' cool
an' wipe 'em off the earth, but pshaw! i got to go to school
what good is 'rithmetic an' things, exceptin' jest for girls
er them there fauntleroys 'at wears their hair in pretty curls
an' if my name is never seen on hist'ry's page, why, you'll
remember 'at it's all because i got to go to school
silent he watched them--the soldiers and dog
tin toys on the little armchair
keeping their tryst through the slow going years
for the hand that had stationed them there
and he said that perchance the dust and the rust
hid the griefs that the toy friends knew
and his heart watched with them all the dark years
yearning ever for little boy blue
three mourners they were for little boy blue
three ere the cold winds had begun
now two are left watching--the soldier and dog
but for him the vigil is done
for him too, the angel has chanted a song
a song that is lulling and true
he has seen the white gates of the mansions of rest
thrown wide by his little boy blue
god sent not the angel of death for his soul
not the reaper who cometh for all
but out of the shadows that curtained the day
he heard his lost little one call
heard the voice that he loved, and following fast
passed on to the far-away strand
and he walks the streets of the city of peace
with little boy blue by the hand
in gettysburg at break of day
the hosts of war are held in leash
to gird them for the coming fray
e'er brazen-throated monsters flame
mad hounds of death that tear and maim
ho, boys in blue
and gray so true
fate calls to-day the roll of fame
on cemetery hill was done
the clangor of four hundred guns
through drifting smoke the morning sun
shone down a line of battled gray
where pickett's waiting soldiers lay
virginians all
heed glory's call
you die at gettysburg to-day
great lee had named; he knew them well
oft had their steel the battle stayed
o warriors of the eagle plume
fate points for you the hour of doom
ring rebel yell
war cry and knell
the stars, to-night, will set in gloom
o pickett's men, ye sons of fate
awe-stricken nations bide your deeds
for you the centuries did wait
while wrong had writ her lengthening scroll
and god had set the judgment roll
a thousand years
shall wait in tears
and one swift hour bring to goal
the charge is done, a cause is lost
but pickett's men heed not the din
of ragged columns battle tost
for fame enshrouds them on the field
and pierced, virginia, is thy shield
but stars and bars
shall drape thy scars
no cause is lost till honor yield
w'en you see a man in woe
walk right up and say "hullo
say "hullo" and "how d'ye do
how's the world a-usin' you
slap the fellow on the back
bring your hand down with a whack
walk right up, and don't go slow
grin an' shake, an' say "hullo
is he clothed in rags? oh! sho
walk right up an' say "hullo
rags is but a cotton roll
jest for wrappin' up a soul
an' a soul is worth a true
hale and hearty "how d'ye do
don't wait for the crowd to go
walk right up and say "hullo
when big vessels meet, they say
they saloot an' sail away
jest the same are you an' me
lonesome ships upon a sea
each one sailin' his own log
for a port behind the fog
let your speakin' trumpet blow
lift your horn an' cry "hullo
say "hullo!" an' "how d'ye do
other folks are good as you
w'en you leave your house of clay
wanderin' in the far away
w'en you travel through the strange
country t'other side the range
then the souls you've cheered will know
who ye be, an' say "hullo
bring, novelist, your note-book! bring, dramatist, your pen
and i'll tell you a simple story of what women do for men
it's only a tale of a lifeboat, of the dying and the dead
of the terrible storm and shipwreck that happened off mumbles head
maybe you have traveled in wales, sir, and know it north and south
maybe you are friends with the "natives" that dwell at oystermouth
it happens, no doubt, that from bristol you've crossed in a casual way
and have sailed your yacht in the summer in the blue of swansea bay
well! it isn't like that in the winter, when the lighthouse stands alone
in the teeth of atlantic breakers that foam on its face of stone
it wasn't like that when the hurricane blew, and the storm-bell tolled
or when
there was news of a wreck, and the lifeboat launched, and a desperate cry
for men
when in the world did the coxswain shirk? a brave old salt was he
proud to the bone of as four strong lads as ever had tasted the sea
welshmen all to the lungs and loins, who, about that coast, 'twas said
had saved some hundred lives apiece--at a shilling or so a head
so the father launched the lifeboat, in the teeth of the tempest's roar
and he stood like a man at the rudder, with an eye on his boys at the oar
out to the wreck went the father! out to the wreck went the sons
leaving the weeping of women, and booming of signal guns
leaving the mother who loved them, and the girls that the sailors love
going to death for duty, and trusting to god above
do you murmur a prayer, my brothers, when cozy and safe in bed
for men like these, who are ready to die for a wreck off mumbles head
it didn't go well with the lifeboat! 'twas a terrible storm that blew
and it snapped the' rope in a second that was flung to the drowning crew
and then the anchor parted--'twas a tussle to keep afloat
but the father stuck to the rudder, and the boys to the brave old boat
then at last on the poor doomed lifeboat a wave broke mountains high
half of the crew swam shoreward, half to the sheltered caves
but father and sons were fighting death in the foam of the angry waves
up at a lighthouse window two women beheld the storm
and saw in the boiling breakers a figure--a fighting form
it might be a gray-haired father, then the women held their breath
it might be a fair-haired brother, who was having a round with death
it might be a lover, a husband, whose kisses were on the lips
of the women whose love is the life of men going down to the sea in ships
they had seen the launch of the lifeboat, they had seen the worst, and
then, kissing each other, these women went down from the lighthouse
straight to shore
there by the rocks on the breakers these sisters, hand in hand
beheld once more that desperate man who struggled to reach the land
but what are a couple of women with only a man to save
what are a couple of women? well, more than three craven men
who stood by the shore with chattering teeth, refusing to stir--and then
off went the women's shawls, sir; in a second they're torn and rent
then knotting them into a rope of love, straight into the sea they went
as they caught the waves on their foreheads, resisting the fierce attack
we'll lose our lives, god willing, before that man shall drown
just follow me, brave, to the shingle, and we'll bring him safe to land
wait for the next wave, darling! only a minute more
and i'll have him safe in my arms, dear, and we'll drag him to the shore
up to the arms in the water, fighting it breast to breast
they caught and saved a brother alive. god bless them! you know the rest
well, many a heart beat stronger, and many a tear was shed
and many a glass was tossed right off to "the women of mumbles head
that man on the enjine thar
don't pack the han'somest countenance
every inch of it sportin' a scar
but i tell you, pard, thar ain't money enough
piled up in the national banks
to buy that face, nor a single scar
an' a better one never war knowed
bin a runnin' yar since the fust machine
war put on the quincy road
an' thar ain't a galoot that pulls a plug
from maine to the jumpin' off place
that knows more about the big iron hoss
than him with the battered-up face
in a sort o' legitimate way
he got it a-trying to save a gal
up yar on the road last may
i heven't much time for to spin you the yarn
for we pull out at two-twenty-five
just wait till i climb up an' toss in some coal
so's to keep old '90' alive
left quincy a half an hour late
an' war skimmin' along purty lively, so's not
to lay out no. 21 freight
the '90' war more than whoopin' 'em up
an' a-quiverin' in every nerve
when all to once jim yelled 'merciful god
as she shoved her sharp nose 'round a curve
stood a gal on the track, her hands raised aloft
an' her face jist as white as the snow
it seems she war so paralyzed with the fright
that she couldn't move for'ard or back
an' when jim pulled the whistle she fainted an' fell
right down in a heap on the track
the look that cum over jim's face
he throw'd the old lever cl'r back like a shot
so's to slacken the '90's' wild pace
then let on the air brakes as quick as a flash
an' out through the window he fled
an' skinned 'long the runnin' board cla'r in front
an' lay on the pilot ahead
he grabbed a tight hold, of her arm
an' raised her right up so's to throw her one side
out o' reach of danger an' harm
but somehow he slipped an' fell with his head
on the rail as he throw'd the young lass
an' the pilot in strikin' him, ground up his face
in a frightful and horrible mass
to that spot where the poor fellow lay
an' there sot the gal with his head in her lap
an' wipin' the warm blood away
the tears rolled in torrents right down from her eyes
while she sobbed like her heart war all broke
i tell you, my friend, such a sight as that 'ar
would move the tough heart of an oak
what for week arter week the boy lay
a-hoverin' right in the shadder o' death
an' that gal by his bed every day
but nursin' an' doctorin' brought him around
kinder snatched him right outer the grave
his face ain't so han'some as 'twar, but his heart
remains just as noble an' brave
he fell dead in love, did this jim
but hadn't the heart to ax her to have
sich a batter'd-up rooster as him
she know'd how he felt, and last new year's day
war the fust o' leap year as you know
so she jist cornered jim an' proposed on the spot
an' you bet he didn't say no
an' has laid up a snug pile o' cash
the weddin's to be on the first o' next may
jist a year from the day o' the smash
the gal says he risked his dear life to save hers
an' she'll just turn the tables about
an' give him the life that he saved--thar's the bell
good day, sir, we're goin' to pull out
sometimes w'en i am playin' with some fellers 'at i knows

dear little flag in the window there
hung with a tear and a woman's prayer
child of old glory, born with a star
oh, what a wonderful flag you are
blue is your star in its field of white
dipped in the red that was born of fight
born of the blood that our forebears shed
to raise your mother, the flag, o'er-head
and now you've come, in this frenzied day
to speak from a window--to speak and say
gone, to be gone till the victory's won
the flag of his mother--i speak for her
who stands by my window and waits and fears
but hides from the others her unwept tears
for the safe return of a martial mate
a mate gone forth where the war god thrives
to save from sacrifice other men's wives
the often unthought of--the sisters, too
i am the flag of a mother's son
who won't come home till the victory's won
dear little flag in the window there
hung with a tear and a woman's prayer
child of old glory, born with a star
oh, what a wonderful flag you are
cheeriest room, that morn, the kitchen. helped by bridget's willing hands
bustled hannah, deftly mixing pies, for ready waiting pans
little flossie flitted round them, and her curling, floating hair
glinted gold-like, gleamed and glistened, in the sparkling sunlit air
slouched a figure o'er the lawn; a man so wretched and forlore
tattered, grim, so like a beggar, ne'er had trod that path before
his shirt was torn, his hat was gone, bare and begrimed his knees
face with blood and dirt disfigured, elbows peeped from out his sleeves
rat-tat-tat, upon the entrance, brought aunt hannah to the door
parched lips humbly plead for water, as she scanned his misery o'er
wrathful came the dame's quick answer; made him cower, shame, and start
out of sight, despairing, saddened, hurt and angry to the heart
move, you thief! leave now these grounds, sir, or our dogs will help you
quick
then the man with dragging footsteps hopeless, wishing himself dead
crept away from sight of plenty, starved in place of being fed
wandered farther from the mansion, till he reached a purling brook
babbling, trilling broken music by a green and shady nook
here sweet flossie found him fainting; in her hands were food and drink
pale like death lay he before her, yet the child-heart did not shrink
then the rags from off his forehead, she with dainty hands offstripped
in the brooklet's rippling waters, her own lace-trimmed 'kerchief dipped
then with sweet and holy pity, which, within her, did not daunt
bathed the blood and grime-stained visage of that sin-soiled son of want
wrung she then the linen cleanly, bandaged up the wound again
ere the still eyes opened slowly; white lips murmuring, "am i sane
paused he mute and undecided, while deep sobs his form did shake
with an avalanche of feeling, and great tears came rolling down
o'er a face unused to showing aught except a sullen frown
that "our god" unsealed a fountain his whole life had never known
when that human angel near him spoke of her god as his own
it may help you to forgive her: 'love your enemies and those
who despitefully may use you; love them whether friends or foes
then she glided from his vision, left him prostrate on the ground
conning o'er and o'er that lesson--with a grace to him new found
sunlight filtering through green branches as they wind-wave dance and dip
finds a prayer his mother taught him, trembling on his crime-stained lip
hist! a step, an angry mutter, and the owner of the place
gentle flossie's haughty father, and the tramp stood face to face
off with it, and cast it down here. come! be quick about it now
as the man did not obey him, flossie's father lashed his cheek
with a riding-whip he carried; struck him hard and cut him deep
quick the tramp bore down upon him, felled him, o'er him where he lay
raised a knife to seek his life-blood. then there came a thought to stay
all his angry, murderous impulse, caused the knife to shuddering fall
at midnight, lambent, lurid flames light up the sky with fiercest beams
wild cries, "fire! fire!" ring through the air, and red like blood each
flame now seems
they faster grow, they higher throw weird, direful arms which ever lean
about the gray stone mansion old. now roars the wind to aid the scene
the flames yet higher, wilder play. a shudder runs through all around
distinctly as in light of day, at topmost window from the ground
sweet flossie stands, her golden hair enhaloed now by firelit air
loud rang the father's cry: "o god! my child! my child! will no one dare
for her sweet sake the flaming stair?" look, one steps forth with muffled
leaps through the flames with fleetest feet, on trembling ladder runs a
with life and death--the window gains. deep silence falls on all around
till bursts aloud a sobbing wail. the ladder falls with crashing sound
a flaming, treacherous mass. o god! she was so young and he so brave
look once again. see! see! on highest roof he stands--the fiery wave
fierce rolling round--his arms enclasp the child--god help him yet to save
he cries, then makes a vaulting leap
a tree branch catches, with sure aim
and by the act proclaims his name
the air was rent, the cheers rang loud
a rough voice cried from out the crowd
none dares that leap but flying jim
a jail-bird--outlaw--thief, indeed
yet o'er them all takes kingly lead
i've breathed the flames, 'twill not be long
then hushed all murmurs through the throng
with reverent hands they bore him where
the summer evening's cooling air
came softly sighing through the trees
the child's proud father on his knees
forgiveness sought of god and jim
which dying lips accorded him
a mark of whip on white face stirred
to gleaming scarlet at his words
she taught me that and i fulfill
i would her hand might touch my face
though she's so pure and i so base
low flossie bent and kissed the brow
with smile of bliss transfigured now
death, the angel, sealed it there
in a pioneer's cabin out west, so they say
a great big black grizzly trotted one day
and seated himself on the hearths and began
to lap the contents of a two gallon pan
of milk and potatoes,--an excellent meal
and then looked, about to see what he could steal
the lord of the mansion awoke from his sleep
and, hearing a racket, he ventured to peep
just out in the kitchen, to see what was there
and was scared to behold a great grizzly bear
so he screamed in alarm to his slumbering frau
so betty leaped up, and the poker she seized
while her man shut the door, and against it he squeezed
as betty then laid on the grizzly her blows
now on his forehead, and now on his nose
her man through the key-hole kept shouting within
now poke with the poker, and' poke his eyes out
so, with rapping and poking, poor betty alone
at last laid sir bruin as dead as a stone
now when the old man saw the bear was no more
he ventured to poke his nose out of the door
and there was the grizzly stretched on the floor
then off to the neighbors he hastened, to tell
all the wonderful things that that morning befell
and he published the marvellous story afar
how "me and my betty jist slaughtered a bar
o yes, come and see, all the neighbors they seed it
come and see what we did, me and betty, we did it
they grew in beauty, side by side
they filled one home with glee
their graves are severed, far and wide
by mount, and stream and sea
the same fond mother bent at night
o'er each fair sleeping brow
she had each folded flower in sight
where are those dreamers now
one, 'midst the forest of the west
by a dark stream is laid
the indian knows his place of rest
far in the cedar shade
the sea, the blue lone sea, hath one
he lies where pearls lie deep
o'er his low bed may weep
one sleeps where southern vines are drest
above the noble slain
he wrapped his colors round his breast
on a blood-red field of spain
and one--o'er _her_ the myrtle showers
its leaves, by soft winds fanned
she faded 'midst italian flowers
the last of that bright band
and parted thus they rest, who play'd
beneath the same green tree
whose voices mingled as they pray'd
around the parent knee
they that with smiles lit up the hall
and cheer'd with song the hearth
alas! for love, if _thou_ wert all
and naught beyond, o earth
nae shoon to hide her tiny taes
nae stockings on her feet
her supple ankles white as snow
or early blossoms sweet
her simple dress of sprinkled pink
her double, dimpled chin
her pucker'd lip and bonny mou
with nae ane tooth between
her een sae like her mither's een
twa gentle, liquid things
her face is like an angel's face
we're glad she has nae wings
away, away in the northland
where the hours of the day are few
and the nights are so long in winter
they cannot sleep them through
where they harness the swift reindeer
to the sledges, when it snows
and the children look like bears' cubs
in their funny, furry clothes
they tell them a curious story
i don't believe 't is true
and yet you may learn a lesson
if i tell the tale to you
once, when the good saint peter
lived in the world below
and walked about it, preaching
just as he did, you know
he came to the door of a cottage
in traveling round the earth
where a little woman was making cakes
and baking them on the hearth
and being faint with fasting
for the day was almost done
he asked her, from her store of cakes
to give him a single one
so she made a very little cake
but as it baking lay
she looked at it, and thought it seemed
too large to give away
therefore she kneaded another
and still a smaller one
but it looked, when she turned it over
as large as the first had done
then she took a tiny scrap of dough
and rolled, and rolled it flat
and baked it thin as a wafer
but she couldn't part with that
for she said, "my cakes that seem too small
when i eat of them myself
are yet too large to give away
so she put them on the shelf
then good saint peter grew angry
for he was hungry and faint
and surely such a woman
was enough to provoke a saint
and he said, "you are far too selfish
to dwell in a human form
to have both food and shelter
and fire to keep you warm
and shall get your scanty food
by boring, and boring, and boring
all day in the hard dry wood
then up she went through the chimney
never speaking a word
and out of the top flew a woodpecker
for she was changed to a bird
she had a scarlet cap on her head
and that was left the same
bat all the rest of her clothes were burned
black as a coal in the flame
and every country school boy
has seen her in the wood
where she lives in the woods till this very day
boring and boring for food
and this is the lesson she teaches
live not for yourself alone
lest the needs you will not pity
shall one day be your own
give plenty of what is given to you
listen to pity's call
don't think the little you give is great
and the much you get is small
now, my little boy, remember that
and try to be kind and good
when you see the woodpecker's sooty dress
and see her scarlet hood
you mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live
as selfishly as you can
but you will be changed to a smaller thing
a mean and selfish man
did you tackle the trouble that came your way
with a resolute heart and cheerful
or hide year face from the light of day
with a craven soul and fearful
oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce
or a trouble is what you make it
and it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts
but only how did you take it
you are beaten to earth? well, well, what's that
come up with a smiling face
its nothing against you to fall down flat
but to lie there--that's disgrace
the harder you're thrown, why, the higher the bounce
be proud of your blackened eye
it isn't the fact that you're licked that counts
it's how did you fight--and why
and though you be done to the death, what then
if you battled the best you could
if you played your part in the world of men
why, the critic will call it good
death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce
and whether he's slow or spry
it isn't the fact that you're dead that counts
but only how did you die
when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and the school for the day is dismissed
and the little ones gather around me
to bid me good-night and be kissed
oh, the little white arms that encircle
my neck in a tender embrace
oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven
shedding sunshine and love on my face
and when they, are gone, i sit dreaming
of my childhood, too lovely to last
of love that my heart will remember
when it wakes to the pulse of the past
ere the world and its wickedness made me
a partner of sorrow and sin
when the glory of god was about me
and the glory of gladness within
oh, my heart grows as weak as a woman's
and the fountains of feeling will flow
when i think of the paths, steep and stony
where the feet of the dear ones must go
of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them
of the tempests of fate blowing wild
oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy
as the innocent heart of a child
they are idols of hearts and of households
they are angels of god in disguise
his sunlight still sleeps in their tresses
his glory still beams in their eyes
oh, those truants from earth and from heaven
they have made me more manly and mild
and i know how jesus could liken
the kingdom of god to a child
seek not a life for the dear ones
all radiant, as others have done
but that life may have just enough shadow
to temper the glare of the sun
i would pray god to guard them from evil
but my prayer would bound back to myself
ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner
but the sinner must pray for himself
the twig is so easily bended
i have banished the rule of the rod
i have taught them the goodness of knowledge
they have taught me the goodness of god
my heart is a dungeon of darkness
where i shut them from breaking a rule
my frown is sufficient correction
my love is the law of the school
i shall leave the old house in the autumn
to traverse the threshold no more
ah! how i shall sigh for the dear ones
that meet me each morn at the door
i shall miss the good-nights and the kisses
and the gush of their innocent glee
the group on the green and the flowers
that are brought every morning to me
i shall miss them at morn and at evening
their song in the school and the street
i shall miss the low hum of their voices
and the tramp of their delicate feet
when the lessons and tasks are all ended
and death says the school is dismissed
may the little ones gather around me
to bid me good-night and be kissed
the sunlight shone on walls of stone
and towers sublime and tall
king alfred sat upon his throne
within his council hall
and glancing o'er the splendid throng
with grave and solemn face
to where his noble vassals stood
he saw a vacant place
with anxious look, he said
before the monarch could express
the sorrow that he felt
a soldier, with a war-worn face
approached the throne, and knelt
o king, at thy command
and many a proud and haughty dane
has fallen by my hand
and 'neath the greenwood tree
it is but fair for thee to give
yon vacant place to me
my wisdom has done more for thee
than either sword or spear
have made thee more renown
than all the triumphs of the field
have given to thy crown
my talents have been thine
bestow this earldom, then, on me
for it is justly mine
yet, while before the monarch's throne
these men contending stood
a woman crossed the floor, who wore
the weeds of widowhood
and slowly to king alfred's feet
a fair-haired boy she led
of holderness," she said
let no man do him wrong
for he is weak and fatherless
and thou art just and strong
can such a feeble child as this
do aught for thee, o king
to draw thy deadly bows
when thou art wanting crafty men
to crush thy mortal foes
with earnest voice the fair young boy
replied: "i cannot fight
but i can pray to god, o king
and god can give thee might
the king bent down and kissed the child
the courtiers turned away
our blood may stain the sod
but what are human strength and power
without the help of god
try, try again
if at first you don't succeed
try, try again
then your courage shall appear
for if you will persevere
you will conquer, never fear
try, try again
once or twice though you should fail
try, try again
if at last you would prevail
try, try again
if we strive 'tis no disgrace
tho' we may not win the race
what should you do in that case
try, try again
if you find your task is hard
try, try again
time will bring you your reward
try, try again
all that other folks can do
why, with patience, may not you
only keep this rule in view
try, try again
ye say they all have passed away--that noble race and brave
that their light canoes have vanished from off the crested wave
that,'mid the forests where they roamed, there rings no hunter's shout
but their name is on your waters--ye may not wash it out
where strong niagara's thunders wake the echo of the world
where red missouri bringeth rich tribute from the west
and rappahannock sweetly sleeps on green virginia's breast
ye say their cone-like cabins, that clustered o'er the vale
have fled away like withered leaves, before the autumn's gale
but their memory liveth on your hills, their baptism on your shore
your everlasting rivers speak their dialect of yore
old massachusetts wears it upon her lordly crown
and broad ohio bears it amid his young renown
connecticut hath wreathed it where her quiet foliage waves
and bold kentucky breathes it hoarse through all her ancient caves
wachusett hides its lingering voice within his rocky heart
and alleghany graves its tone throughout his lofty chart
monadnock on his forehead hoar doth seal the sacred trust
your mountains build their monument, though ye destroy their dust
ye call those red-browed brethren the insects of an hour
crushed like the noteless worm amid the regions of their power
ye drive them from their fathers' lands, ye break of faith the seal
but can ye from the court of heaven exclude their last appeal
ye see their unresisting tribes, with toilsome steps and slow
on through the trackless desert pass, a caravan of woe
think ye the eternal ear is deaf? his sleepless vision dim
think ye the soul's blood may not cry from that far land to him
sick in the hospital. he confided to a friend, colonel hawkins of
tennessee, that he was grieving because his fiancee, a nashville girl
had not written to him. the soldier died soon afterward, colonel hawkins
having promised to open and answer any mail that came for him. this poem
is in reply to a letter from his friend's fiancee, in which she curtly
broke the engagement
your letter, lady, came too late
for heaven had claimed its own
ah, sudden change--from prison bars
unto the great white throne
and yet i think he would have stayed
to live for his disdain
could he have read the careless words
which you have sent in vain
so full of patience did he wait
through many a weary hour
that o'er his simple soldier-faith
not even death had power
and you--did others whisper low
their homage in your ear
as though among their shallow throng
his spirit had a peer
i would that you were by me now
to draw the sheet aside
and see how pure the look he wore
the moment when he died
the sorrow that you gave to him
had left its weary trace
as 'twere the shadow of the cross
upon his pallid face
the winter's cold to spring
ah, trust of fickle maiden's love
thou art a bitter thing
for when these valleys, bright in may
once more with blossoms wave
the northern violets shall blow
above his humble grave
your dole of scanty words had been
but one more pang to bear
for him who kissed unto the last
your tress of golden hair
i did not put it where he said
for when the angels come
i would not have them find the sign
of falsehood in the tomb
i've read your letter, and i know
the wiles that you have wrought
to win that trusting heart of his
and gained it--cruel thought
what lavish wealth men sometimes give
for what is worthless all
what manly bosoms beat for them
in folly's falsest thrall
you shall not pity him, for now
his sorrow has an end
yet would that you could stand with me
beside my fallen friend
and i forgive you for his sake
as he--if he be forgiven
may e'en be pleading grace for you
before the court of heaven
to-night the cold winds whistle by
as i my vigil keep
within the prison dead-house, where
few mourners come to weep
a rude plank coffin holds his form
yet death exalts his face
and i would rather see him thus
than clasped in your embrace
to-night your home may shine with light
and ring with merry song
and you be smiling as your soul
had done no deadly wrong
your hand so fair that none would think
it penned these words of pain
your skin so white--would god your heart
were half as free from stain
i'd rather be my comrade dead
than you in life supreme
for yours the sinner's waking dread
and his the martyr's dream
whom serve we in this life we serve
in that which is to come
he chose his way, you--yours; let god
pronounce the fitting doom
a harbor in a sunny, southern city
ships at their anchor, riding in the lee
a little lad, with steadfast eyes, and dreamy
who ever watched the waters lovingly
a group of sailors, quaintly garbed and bearded
strange tales, that snared the fancy of the child
of far-off lands, strange beasts, and birds, and people
of storm and sea-fight, danger-filled and wild
and ever in the boyish soul was ringing
the urging, surging challenge of the sea
to dare,--as these men dared, its wrath and danger
to learn,--as they, its charm and mystery
columbus, by the sunny, southern harbor
you dreamed the dreams that manhood years made true
thank god for men--their deeds have crowned the ages
who once were little dreamy lads like you
i'm not a chicken; i have seen
full many a chill september
and though i was a youngster then
that gale i well remember
the day before, my kite-string snapped
and i, my kite pursuing
the wind whisked off my palm-leaf hat
for me two storms were brewing
it came as quarrels sometimes do
when married folks get clashing
there was a heavy sigh or two
before the fire was flashing
a little stir among the clouds
before they rent asunder
a little rocking of the trees
and then came on the thunder
lord! how the ponds and rivers boiled
and how the shingles rattled
and oaks were scattered on the ground
as if the titans battled
and all above was in a howl
and all below a clatter
the earth was like a frying-pan
or some such hissing matter
it chanced to be our washing-day
and all our things were drying
the storm came roaring through the lines
and set them all a-flying
i saw the shirts and petticoats
go riding off like witches
i lost, ah! bitterly i wept
i lost my sunday breeches
i saw them straddling through the air
alas! too late to win them
i saw them chase the clouds, as if
the devil had been in them
they were my darlings and my pride
my boyhood's only riches
that night i saw them in my dreams
how changed from what i knew them
the dews had steeped their faded threads
the winds had whistled through them
i saw the wide and ghastly rents
where demon claws had torn them
a hole was in their amplest part
as if an imp had worn them
i have had many happy years
and tailors kind and clever
but those young pantaloons have gone
forever and forever
and not till fate has cut the last
of all my earthly stitches
this aching heart shall cease to mourn
my loved, my long-lost breeches
somewhere, out on the blue sea sailing
where the winds dance and spin
beyond the reach of my eager hailing
over the breakers' din
out where the dark storm-clouds are lifting
out where the blinding fog is drifting
out where the treacherous sand is shifting
my ship is coming in
o, i have watched till my eyes were aching
day after weary day
o, i have hoped till my heart was breaking
while the long nights ebbed away
could i but know where the waves had tossed her
could i but know what storms had crossed her
could i but know where the winds had lost her
out in the twilight gray
but though the storms her course have altered
surely the port she'll win
never my faith in my ship has faltered
i know she is coming in
for through the restless ways of her roaming
through the mad rush of the wild waves foaming
through the white crest of the billows combing
my ship is coming in
beating the tides where the gulls are flying
swiftly she's coming in
shallows and deeps and rocks defying
bravely she's coming in
precious the love she will bring to bless me
snowy the arms she will bring to caress me
in the proud purple of kings she will dress me
my ship that is coming in
white in the sunshine her sails will be gleaming
see, where my ship comes in
at masthead and peak her colors streaming
proudly she's sailing in
love, hope and joy on her decks are cheering
music will welcome her glad appearing
and my heart will sing at her stately nearing
when my ship comes in
laugh, and the world laughs with you
weep, and you weep alone
for the sad old earth must borrow its mirth
but has trouble enough of its own
sing, and the hills will answer
sigh, it is lost on the air
the echoes bound to a joyful sound
but shirk from voicing care
rejoice and men will seek you
grieve, and they turn and go
they want full measure of all your pleasure
but they do not need your woe
be glad, and your friends are many
be sad, and you lose them all
there are none to decline your nectar'd wine
but alone you must drink life's gall
feast, and your halls are crowded
fast, and the world goes by
succeed and give, and it helps you live
but no man can help you die
there is room in the halls of pleasure
for a large and lordly train
but one by one we must all file on
through the narrow aisle of pain
the coppenter man said a wicked word
when he hitted his thumb one day
en i know what it was, because i heard
en it's somethin' i dassent say
he growed us a house with rooms inside it
en the rooms is full of floors
it's my papa's house, en when he buyed it
it was nothin' but just outdoors
en they planted stones in a hole for seeds
en that's how the house began
but i guess the stones would have just growed weeds
except for the coppenter man
en the coppenter man took a board and said
he'd skin it and make some curls
en i hung 'em onto my ears en head
en they make me look like girls
en he squinted along one side, he did
en he squinted the other side twice
en then he told me, "you squint it, kid
but the coppenter man said a wicked word
when he hitted 'his thumb that day
he said it out loud, too, 'cause i heard
en it's something i dassent say
en the coppenter man said it wasn't bad
when you hitted your thumb, kerspat
en there'd be no coppenter men to be had
if it wasn't for words like that
no, i never, till life and its shadows shall end
can forget the sweet sound of the bells of ostend
the day set in darkness, the wind it blew loud
and rung as it passed through each murmuring shroud
my forehead was wet with the foam of the spray
my heart sighed in secret for those far away
when slowly the morning advanced from the east
the toil and the noise of the tempest had ceased
the peal from a land i ne'er saw, seemed to say
yet the short-lived emotion was mingled with pain
i thought of those eyes i should ne'er see again
i thought of the kiss, the last kiss which i gave
and a tear of regret fell unseen on the wave
i thought of the schemes fond affection had planned
of the trees, of the towers, of my own native land
but still the sweet sounds, as they swelled to the air
seemed tidings of pleasure, though mournful to bear
and i never, till life and its shadows shall end
can forget the sweet sound of the bells of ostend
with sable-draped banners and slow measured tread
the flower laden ranks pass the gates of the dead
and seeking each mound where a comrade's form rests
leave tear-bedewed garlands to bloom, on his breast
ended at last is the labor of love
once more through the gateway the saddened lines move
a wailing of anguish, a sobbing of grief
falls low on the ear of the battle-scarred chief
close crouched by the portals, a sunny-haired child
besought him in accents with grief rendered wild
why, why, did you pass by my dear papa's grave
i know he was poor, but as kind and as true
as ever marched into the battle with you
his grave is so humble, no stone marks the spot
you may not have seen it. oh, say you did not
for my poor heart will break if you knew he was there
and thought him too lowly your offerings to share
he didn't die lowly--he poured his heart's blood
in rich crimson streams, from the top-crowning sod
of the breastworks which stood in front of the fight
and died shouting, 'onward! for god and the right
o'er all his dead comrades your bright garlands wave
but you haven't put _one_ on _my_ papa's grave
if mamma were here--but she lies by his side
her wearied heart broke when our dear papa died
then up in his arms from the hot, dusty street
he lifted the maiden, while in through the gate
the long line repasses, and many an eye
pays fresh tribute of tears to the lone orphan's sigh
they lie close together, with just room for me
a love pure as this makes these graves hallowed ground
the kindness you've shown little daisy to-day
but i'll pray for you here, each day while i live
i shall see papa soon and dear mamma, too
i dreamed so last night, and i know 'twill come true
and they will both bless you, i know, when i say
how you folded your arms round their dear one to-day
how you cheered her sad heart and soothed it to rest
and hushed its wild throbs on your strong, noble breast
and when the kind angels shall call _you_ to come
we'll welcome you there to our beautiful home
where death never comes his black banners to wave
and the beautiful flowers ne'er weep o'er a grave
two little stockings hung side by side
close to the fireside broad and wide
loaded with toys and many a game
there's only one little girl lives here
so he crept up close to the chimney place
and measured a sock with a sober face
just then a wee little note fell out
and fluttered low, like a bird, about
as he pushed his specs up close to his eyes
and read the address in a child's rough plan
i have hung up for a child named clara hall
so i thought, perhaps, you kindly would
fill up her stocking, too, to-night
and help to make her christmas bright
if you've not enough for both stockings there
please put all in clara's, i shall not care
saint nicholas brushed a tear from his eye
and, "god bless you, darling," he said with a sigh
then softly he blew through the chimney high
a note like a bird's, as it soars on high
when down came two of the funniest mortals
that ever were seen this side earth's portals
all a little girl wants where money is rare
then, oh, what a scene there was in that room
away went the elves, but down from the gloom
of the sooty old chimney came tumbling low
a child's whole wardrobe, from head to toe
how santa clans laughed, as he gathered them in
and fastened each one to the sock with a pin
right to the toe he hung a blue dress
said saint nicholas, smoothing the folds of blue
and tying the hood to the stocking, too
when all the warm clothes were fastened on
and both little socks were filled and done
then santa claus tucked a toy here and there
and hurried away to the frosty air
saying, "god pity the poor, and bless the dear child
who pities them, too, on this night so wild
the wind caught the words and bore them on high
till they died away in the midnight sky
while saint nicholas flew through the icy air
bringing "peace and good will" with him everywhere
i have a rendezvous with death
at some disputed barricade
when spring comes back with rustling shade
and apple-blossoms fill the air
i have a rendezvous with death
when spring brings back blue days and fair
it may be he shall take my hand
and lead me into his dark land
and close my eyes and quench my breath
it may be i shall pass him still
i have a rendezvous with death
on some scarred slope of battered hill
when spring comes round again this year
and the first meadow-flowers appear
god knows't were better to be deep
pillowed in silk and scented down
where love throbs out in blissful sleep
pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath
where hushed awakenings are dear
but i've a rendezvous with death
at midnight in some flaming town
when spring trips north again this year
and i to my pledged word am true
i shall not fail that rendezvous
let us be kind
the way is long and lonely
and human hearts are asking for this blessing only
that we be kind
we cannot know the grief that men may borrow
we cannot see the souls storm-swept by sorrow
but love can shine upon the way to-day, to-morrow
let us be kind
let us be kind
this is a wealth that has no measure
this is of heaven and earth the highest treasure
let us be kind
a tender word, a smile of love in meeting
a song of hope and victory to those retreating
a glimpse of god and brotherhood while life is fleeting
let us be kind
let us be kind
around the world the tears of time are falling
and for the loved and lost these human hearts are calling
let us be kind
to age and youth let gracious words be spoken
upon the wheel of pain so many lives are broken
we live in vain who give no tender token
let us be kind
let us be kind
the sunset tints will soon be in the west
too late the flowers are laid then on the quiet breast
let us be kind
and when the angel guides have sought and found us
their hands shall link the broken ties of earth that bound us
and heaven and home shall brighten all around us
let us be kind
oh! listen to the water mill, through all the livelong day
as the clicking of the wheels wears hour by hour away
how languidly the autumn wind does stir the withered leaves
as in the fields the reapers sing, while binding up their sheaves
a solemn proverb strikes my mind, and as a spell is cast
the summer winds revive no more leaves strewn o'er earth and main
the sickle nevermore will reap the yellow garnered grain
the rippling stream flows on--aye, tranquil, deep and still
but never glideth back again to busy water mill
the solemn proverb speaks to all with meaning deep and vast
ah! clasp the proverb to thy soul, dear loving heart and true
for golden years are fleeting by and youth is passing too
ah! learn to make the most of life, nor lose one happy day
for time will ne'er return sweet joys neglected, thrown away
nor leave one tender word unsaid, thy kindness sow broadcast
oh! the wasted hours of life, that have swiftly drifted by
alas! the good we might have done, all gone without a sigh
love that we might once have saved by a single kindly word
thoughts conceived, but ne'er expressed, perishing unpenned, unheard
oh! take the lesson to thy soul, forever clasp it fast
work on while yet the sun doth shine, thou man of strength and will
the streamlet ne'er doth useless glide by clicking water mill
nor wait until to-morrow's light beams brightly on thy way
for all that thou canst call thine own lies in the phrase "to-day
possession, power and blooming health must all be lost at last
oh! love thy god and fellowman, thyself consider last
for come it will when thou must scan dark errors of the past
soon will this fight of life be o'er and earth recede from view
and heaven in all its glory shine, where all is pure and true
ah! then thou'lt see more clearly still the proverb deep and vast
what makes the dog's nose always cold
i'll try to tell you, curls of gold
if you will good and quiet be
and come and stand by mamma's knee
well, years and years and years ago
how many i don't really know
there came a rain on sea and shore
its like was never seen before
or since. it fell unceasing down
till all the world began to drown
but just before it began to pour
an old, old man--his name was noah
built him an ark, that he might save
his family from a wat'ry grave
and in it also he designed
to shelter two of every kind
of beast. well, dear, when it was done
and heavy clouds obscured the sun
the noah folks to it quickly ran
and then the animals began
to gravely march along in pairs
the leopards, tigers, wolves and bears
the deer, the hippopotamuses
the rabbits, squirrels, elks, walruses
the camels, goats, cats and donkeys
the tall giraffes, the beavers, monkeys
the rats, the big rhinoceroses
the dromedaries and the horses
the sheep, and mice and kangaroos
hyenas, elephants, koodoos
and hundreds more-'twould take all day
my dear, so many names to say
and at the very, very end
of the procession, by his friend
and master, faithful dog was seen
the livelong time he'd helping been
to drive the crowd of creatures in
and now, with loud, exultant bark
he gaily sprang abroad the ark
alas! so crowded was the space
he could not in it find a place
so, patiently, he turned about
stood half way in, half way out
and those extremely heavy showers
descended through nine hundred hours
and more; and, darling, at the close
and never could it lose again
the dampness of that dreadful rain
and that is what, my curls of gold
made all the doggies' noses cold
chained in the market-place he stood
a man of giant frame
amid the gathering multitude
that shrunk to hear his name
all stern of look and strong of limb
his dark eye on the ground
and silently they gazed on him
as on a lion bound
vainly, but well, that chief had fought
he was a captive now
yet pride, that fortune humbles not
was written on his brow
the scars his dark broad bosom wore
showed warrior true and brave
a prince among his tribe before
he could not be a slave
then to his conqueror he spake
undo this necklace from my neck
and take this bracelet ring
and send me where my brother reigns
and i will fill thy hands
with store of ivory from the plains
and gold-dust from the sands
will i unbind thy chain
that bloody hand shall never hold
the battle-spear again
a price thy nation never gave
shall yet be paid for thee
for thou shalt be the christian's slave
in lands beyond the sea
then wept the warrior chief and bade
to shred his locks away
and one by one, each heavy braid
before the victor lay
thick were the platted locks, and long
and deftly hidden there
shone many a wedge of gold among
the dark and crispèd hair
long kept for sorest need
take it--thou askest sums untold
and say that i am freed
take it--my wife, the long, long day
weeps by the cocoa-tree
and my young children leave their play
and ask in vain for me
thy fetters fast and strong
and ween that by the cocoa shade
thy wife will wait thee long
strong was the agony that shook
the captive's frame to hear
and the proud meaning of his look
was changed to mortal fear
his heart was broken--crazed his brain
at once his eye grew wild
he struggled fiercely with his chain
whispered, and wept, and smiled
yet wore not long those fatal bands
and once, at shut of day
they drew him forth upon the sands
the foul hyena's prey
he who lives the golden dream lives fourfold thereby
time may scoff and worlds may laugh, hosts assail his thought
but the visionary came ere the builders wrought
ere the tower bestrode the dome, ere the dome the arch
he, the dreamer of the dream, saw the vision march
he who has the vision hears more than you may hear
unseen lips from unseen worlds are bent unto his ear
from the hills beyond the clouds messages are borne
drifting on the dews of dream to his heart of morn
time awaits and ages stay till he wakes and shows
glimpses of the larger life that his vision knows
he who has the vision feels more than you may feel
joy beyond the narrow joy in whose realm we reel
for he knows the stars are glad, dawn and middleday
in the jocund tide that sweeps dark and dusk away
he who has the vision lives round and all complete
and through him alone we draw dews from combs of sweet
the children kept coming one by one
till the boys were five and the girls were three
and the big brown house was alive with fun
from the basement floor to the old roof-tree
like garden flowers the little ones grew
nurtured and trained with tenderest care
warmed by love's sunshine, bathed in dew
they blossomed into beauty rare
but one of the boys grew weary one day
and leaning his head on his mother's breast
he said, "i am tired and cannot play
let me sit awhile on your knee and rest
she cradled him close to her fond embrace
she hushed him to sleep with her sweetest song
and rapturous love still lightened his face
when his spirit had joined the heavenly throng
then the eldest girl, with her thoughtful eyes
who stood where the "brook and the river meet
stole softly away into paradise
e'er "the river" had reached her slender feet
while the father's eyes on the graves were bent
the mother looked upward beyond the skies
our darlings were angels in earth's disguise
the years flew by, and the children began
with longings to think of the world outside
and as each in turn became a man
the boys proudly went from the father's side
the girls were women so gentle and fair
that lovers were speedy to woo and to win
and with orange-blooms in their braided hair
their old home they left, new homes to begin
so, one by one the children have gone
the boys were five, the girls were three
and the big brown house is gloomy and alone
with but two old folks for its company
they talk to each other about the past
as they sit together at eventide
and say, "all the children we keep at last
are the boy and girl who in childhood died
between broad fields of wheat and corn
is the lowly home where i was born
the peach-tree leans against the wall
and the woodbine wanders over all
there is the shaded doorway still
but a stranger's foot has crossed the sill
there is the barn--and, as of yore
i can smell the hay from the open door
and see the busy swallows throng
and hear the pewee's mournful song
but the stranger comes--oh! painful proof
his sheaves are piled to the heated roof
there is the orchard--the very trees
where my childhood knew long hours of ease
and watched the shadowy moments run
till my life imbibed more shade than sun
the swing from the bough still sweeps the air
but the stranger's children are swinging there
there bubbles the shady spring below
with its bulrush brook where the hazels grow
and watched the minnows poise and shoot
and heard the robin lave his wing
but the stranger's bucket is at the spring
oh, ye who daily cross the sill
step lightly, for i love it still
and when you crowd the old barn eaves
then think what countless harvest sheaves
have passed within' that scented door
to gladden eyes that are no more
deal kindly with these orchard trees
and when your children crowd your knees
their sweetest fruit they shall impart
as if old memories stirred their heart
to youthful sport still leave the swing
and in sweet reverence hold the spring
well, wife, i've found the _model_ church! i worshiped there to-day
it made me think of good old times before my hair was gray
the meetin'-house was fixed up more than they were years ago
but then i felt, when i went in, it wasn't built for show
the sexton didn't seat me away back by the door
he knew that i was old and deaf, as well as old and poor
he must have been a christian, for he led me boldly through
the long aisle of that crowded church to find a pleasant pew
i wish you'd heard that singin'; it had the old-time ring
the preacher said, with trumpet voice: "let all the people sing
the tune was "coronation," and the music upward rolled
till i thought i heard the angels striking all their harps of gold
my deafness seemed to melt away; my spirit caught the fire
i joined my feeble, trembling voice with that melodious choir
and sang as in my youthful days: "let angels prostrate fall
bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him lord of all
i tell you, wife, it did me good to sing that hymn once more
i felt like some wrecked mariner who gets a glimpse of shore
i almost wanted to lay down this weatherbeaten form
and anchor in that blessed port forever from the storm
i know it wasn't written; i know it wasn't read
he hadn't time to read it, for the lightnin' of his eye
went flashin' long from pew to pew, nor passed a sinner by
the sermon wasn't flowery; 'twas simple gospel truth
it fitted poor old men like me; it fitted hopeful youth
the preacher made sin hideous in gentiles and in jews
he shot the golden sentences down in the finest pews
and--though i can't see very well--i saw the falling tear
that told me hell was some ways off, and heaven very near
how swift the golden moments fled within that holy place
how brightly beamed the light of heaven from every happy face
again i longed for that sweet time when friend shall meet with friend
i hope to meet that minister--that congregation, too
in that dear home beyond the stars that shine from heaven's blue
i doubt not i'll remember, beyond life's evenin' gray
the happy hour of worship in that model church today
dear wife, the fight will soon be fought; the vict'ry soon be won
the shinin' goal is just ahead; the race is nearly run
o'er the river we are nearin', they are throngin' to the shore
to shout our safe arrival where the weary weep no more
the gret big church wuz crowded full uv broadcloth an' of silk
an' satins rich as cream thet grows on our ol' brindle's milk
shined boots, biled shirts, stiff dickeys, an' stove-pipe hats were there
an' doodes 'ith trouserloons so tight they couldn't kneel down in prayer
the elder in his poolpit high, said, as he slowly riz
an' as we hev no substitoot, as brother moore ain't here
will some 'un in the congregation be so kind's to volunteer
an' then a red-nosed, blear-eyed tramp, of low-toned, rowdy style
give an interductory hiccup, an' then swaggered up the aisle
then thro' that holy atmosphere there crep' a sense er sin
an' thro' thet air of sanctity the odor uv ol' gin
then deacon purington he yelled, his teeth all set on edge
the tramp didn' hear a word he said, but slouched 'ith stumblin' feet
an' stalked an' swaggered up the steps, an' gained the organ seat
he then went pawin' thro' the keys, an' soon there rose a strain
thet seemed to jest bulge out the heart, an' 'lectrify the brain
an' then he slapped down on the thing 'ith hands an' head an' knees
he slam-dashed his hull body down kerflop upon the keys
the organ roared, the music flood went sweepin' high an' dry
it swelled into the rafters, an' bulged out into the sky
the ol' church shook and staggered, an' seemed to reel an' sway
an' the elder shouted "glory!" an' i yelled out "hooray
an' then he tried a tender strain that melted in our ears
thet brought up blessed memories and drenched 'em down 'ith tears
an' we dreamed uv ol' time kitchens, 'ith tabby on the mat
uv home an' luv an' baby days, an' mother, an' all that
an' then he struck a streak uv hope--a song from souls forgiven
thet burst from prison bars uv sin, an' stormed the gates uv heaven
the morning stars together sung--no soul wuz left alone
we felt the universe wuz safe, an' god was on his throne
an' then a wail of deep despair an' darkness come again
an' long, black crape hung on the doors uv all the homes uv men
no luv, no light, no joy, no hope, no songs of glad delight
an' then--the tramp, he swaggered down an' reeled out into the night
but we knew he'd tol' his story, tho' he never spoke a word
an' it was the saddest story thet our ears had ever heard
he had tol' his own life history, an' no eye was dry thet day
w'en the elder rose an' simply said: "my brethren, let up pray
there lay upon the ocean's shore
what once a tortoise served to cover
a year and more, with rush and roar
the surf had rolled it over
had played with it, and flung it by
as wind and weather might decide it
then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry
cheap burial might provide it
it rested there to bleach or tan
the rains had soaked, the suns had burned it
with many a ban the fisherman
had stumbled o'er and spurned it
and there the fisher-girl would stay
conjecturing with her brother
how in their play the poor estray
might serve some use or other
so there it lay, through wet and dry
as empty as the last new sonnet
till by and by came mercury
and, having mused upon it
in shape, material, and dimension
give it but strings, and, lo, it sings
a wonderful invention
so said, so done; the chords he strained
and, as his fingers o'er them hovered
the shell disdained a soul had gained
the lyre had been discovered
o empty world that round us lies
dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken
brought we but eyes like mercury's
in thee what songs should waken
the old mayor climbed the belfry tower
the ringers rang by two, by three
good ringers, pull your best," quoth he
play all your changes, all your swells
play uppe 'the brides of enderby
men say it was a stolen tyde
the lord that sent it, he knows all
but in myne ears doth still abide
the message that the bells let fall
and there was naught of strange, beside
the flight of mews ans peewits pied
by millions crouched on the old sea-wall
i sat and spun within the doore
my thread break off, i raised myne eyes
the level sun, like ruddy ore
lay sinking in the barren skies
and dark against day's golden death
she moved where lindis wandereth
my sonne's faire wife, elizabeth
ere the early dews were falling
farre away i heard her song
where the reedy lindis floweth
floweth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
faintly came her milking song
leave your meadow grasses mellow
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
quit the stalks of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe jetty, rise and follow
from the clovers lift your head
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
come uppe jetty, rise and follow
jetty, to the milking shed
if it be long, ay, long ago
when i beginne to think howe long
againe i hear the lindis flow
swift as an arrowe, sharp and strong
and all the aire, it seemeth mee
bin full of floating bells (sayeth she
that ring the tune of enderby
alle fresh the level pasture lay
and not a shadowe mote be seene
save where full fyve good miles away
the steeple towered from out the greene
and lo! the great bell farre and wide
was heard in all the country side
that saturday at eventide
the swanherds where there sedges are
moved on in sunset's golden breath
the shepherde lads i heard affare
and my sonne's wife, elizabeth
till floating o'er the grassy sea
came down that kindly message free
the "brides of mavis enderby
then some looked uppe into the sky
and all along where lindis flows
to where the goodly vessels lie
and where the lordly steeple shows
they sayde, "and why should this thing be
what danger lowers by land or sea
they ring the tune of enderby
of pyrate galleys warping downe
for shippes ashore beyond the scorpe
they have not spared to wake the towne
but while the west bin red to see
and storms be none, and pyrates flee
why ring 'the brides of enderby
i looked without, and lo! my sonne
came riding down with might and main
he raised a shout as he drew on
till all the welkin rang again
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth
the rising tide comes on apace
and boats adrift in yonder towne
go sailing uppe the market-place
he shook as one that looks on death
with her two bairns i marked her long
and ere yon bells beganne to play
afar i heard her milking song
he looked across the grassy lea
to right, to left, "ho, enderby
they rang "the brides of enderby
with that he cried and beat his breast
for, lo! along the river's bed
a mighty eygre reared his crest
and uppe the lindis raging sped
it swept with thunderous noises loud
shaped like a curling snow-white cloud
or like a demon in a shroud
and rearing lindis backward pressed
shook all her trembling bankes amaine
then madly at the eygre's breast
flung uppe her weltering walls again
then bankes came downe with ruin and rout
then beaten foam flew round about
then all the mighty floods were out
so farre, so fast the eygre drave
the heart had hardly time to beat
before a shallow seething wave
sobbed in the grasses at oure feet
the feet had hardly time to flee
before it brake against the knee
and all the world was in the sea
upon the roofe we sat that night
the noise of bells went sweeping by
i marked the lofty beacon light
stream from the church tower, red and high
a lurid mark and dread to see
and awesome bells they were to mee
that in the dark rang "enderby
they rang the sailor lads to guide
from roofe to roofe who fearless rowed
and i--my sonne was at my side
and yet the ruddy beacon glowed
and yet he moaned beneath his breath
oh, lost! my love, elizabeth
and didst thou visit him no more
thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare
the waters laid thee at his doore
ere yet the early dawn was clear
thy pretty bairns in fast embrace
the lifted sun shone on thy face
downe drifted to thy dwelling-place
that flow strewed wrecks about the grass
that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea
a fatal ebbe and flow, alas
to manye more than myne and me
but each will mourn his own (she saith
and sweeter woman ne'er drew breath
than my sonne's wife, elizabeth
i shall never hear her more
by the reedy lindis shore
ere the early dews be falling
i shall never hear her song
where the sunny lindis floweth
goeth, floweth
from the meads where melick groweth
when the water winding down
onward floweth to the town
i shall never see her more
where the reeds and rushes quiver
shiver, quiver
stand beside the sobbing river
sobbing, throbbing, in its falling
to the sandy lonesome shore
i shall never hear her calling
mellow, mellow
quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow
come uppe whitefoot, come uppe lightfoot
quit your pipes of parsley hollow
hollow, hollow
come uppe lightfoot, rise and follow
lightfoot, whitefoot
from your clovers lift the head
come uppe jetty, follow, follow
jetty, to the milking-shed
o month of fairer, rarer days
than summer's best have been
when skies at noon are burnished blue
and winds at evening keen
when tangled, tardy-blooming things
from wild waste places peer
and drooping golden grain-heads tell
that harvest-time is near
though autumn tints amid the green
are gleaming, here and there
and spicy autumn odors float
like incense on the air
and sounds we mark as autumn's own
her nearing steps betray
in gracious mood she seems to stand
and bid the summer stay
though 'neath the trees, with fallen leaves
the sward be lightly strown
and nests deserted tell the tale
of summer bird-folk flown
though white with frost the lowlands lie
when lifts the morning haze
still there's a charm in every hour
of sweet september days
who comes dancing over the snow
his soft little feet all bare and rosy
open the door, though the wild wind blow
take the child in and make him cozy
take him in and hold him dear
here is the wonderful glad new year
if you can dress to make yourself attractive
yet not make puffs and curls your chief delight
if you can swim and row, be strong and active
but of the gentler graces lose not sight
if you can dance without a craze for dancing
play without giving play too strong a hold
enjoy the love of friends without romancing
care for the weak, the friendless and the old
if you can master french and greek and latin
and not acquire, as well, a priggish mien
if you can feel the touch of silk and satin
without despising calico and jean
if you can ply a saw and use a hammer
can do a man's work when the need occurs
can sing when asked, without excuse or stammer
can rise above unfriendly snubs and slurs
if you can make good bread as well as fudges
can sew with skill and have an eye for dust
if you can be a friend and hold no grudges
a girl whom all will love because they must
if sometime you should meet and love another
and make a home with faith and peace enshrined
and you its soul--a loyal wife and mother
you'll work out pretty nearly to my mind
the plan that's been developed through the ages
and win the best that life can have in store
you'll be, my girl, the model for the sages
a woman whom the world will bow before
little lass of plymouth,--gentle, shy, and sweet
primly, trimly tripping down the queer old street
homespun frock and apron, clumsy buckled shoe
skirts that reach your ankles, just as mother's do
bonnet closely clinging over braid and curl
modest little maiden,--plymouth's pilgrim girl
little lad of plymouth, stanchly trudging by
strong your frame, and sturdy; kind and keen your eye
clad in belted doublet, buckles at your knee
every garment fashioned as a man's might be
shoulder-cloak and breeches, hat with bell-shaped crown
manly little pilgrim,--boy of plymouth town
boy and girl of plymouth, brave and blithe, and true
finer task than yours was, children never knew
sharing toil and hardship in the strange, new land
hope, and help, and promise of the weary band
grave the life around you, scant its meed of joy
yours to make it brighter,--pilgrim girl and boy
thank god for the might of it
the ardor, the urge, the delight of it
work that springs from the heart's desire
setting the brain and the soul on fire
oh, what is so good as the heat of it
and what is so glad as the beat of it
and what is so kind as the stern command
challenging brain and heart and hand
thank god for the pride of it
for the beautiful, conquering tide of it
sweeping the life in its furious flood
thrilling the arteries, cleansing the blood
mastering stupor and dull despair
moving the dreamer to do and dare
oh, what is so good as the urge of it
and what is so glad as the surge of it
and what is so strong as the summons deep
rousing the torpid soul from sleep
thank god for the pace of it
for the terrible, swift, keen race of it
fiery steeds in full control
nostrils a-quiver to reach the goal
work, the power that drives behind
guiding the purposes, taming the mind
holding the runaway wishes back
reining the will to one steady track
speeding the energies, faster, faster
triumphing ever over disaster
oh, what is so good as the pain of it
and what is so great as the gain of it
and what is so kind as the cruel goad
forcing us on through the rugged road
thank god for the swing of it
for the clamoring, hammering ring of it
passion of labor daily hurled
on the mighty anvils of the world
oh, what is so fierce as the flame of it
and what is so huge as the aim of it
thundering on through dearth and doubt
calling the plan of the maker out
work, the titan; work, the friend
shaping the earth to a glorious end
draining the swamps and blasting hills
doing whatever the spirit wills
rending a continent apart
to answer the dream of the master heart
thank god for a world where none may shirk
thank god for the splendor of work
ask for
you say i have asked for the costliest thing
ever made by the hand above
a woman's heart and a woman's life
and a woman's wonderful love
that i have written your duty out
and, man-like, have questioned free
you demand that i stand at the bar of your soul
while you in turn question me
and when i ask you to be my wife
the head of my house and home
whose path i would scatter with sunshine through life
thy shield when sorrow shall come
you reply with disdain and a curl of the lip
and point to my coat's missing button
and haughtily ask if i want a _cook
to serve up my _beef_ and my _mutton
but only a plain, earnest man
whose feet often shun the hard path they should tread
often shrink from the gulf they should span
from the cheek so full, so fair
was ever reflected there
true, the rose will fade, and the leaves will fall
and the autumn of life will come
but the heart that i give thee will be true as in may
should i make it thy shelter, thy home
thou requir'st "all things that are good and true
all things that a man should be
ah! lady, my _truth_, in return, doubt not
for the rest, i leave it to thee
i cannot vouch my tale is true
nor say, indeed, 'tis wholly new
but true or false, or new or old
i think you'll find it fairly told
a frenchman, who had ne'er before
set foot upon a foreign shore
weary of home, resolved to go
and see what holland had to show
he didn't know a word of dutch
but that could hardly grieve him much
he thought, as frenchmen always do
that all the world could "parley-voo
at length our eager tourist stands
within the famous netherlands
and, strolling gaily here and there
in search of something rich or rare
a lordly mansion greets his eyes
and, bowing to the man who sate
in livery at the garden gate
whose very charming grounds are these
and, pardon me, be pleased to tell
who in this splendid house may dwell
to which, in dutch, the puzzled man
replied what seemed like "nick van stann
is equally superb and chaste
so fine a house, upon my word
not even paris can afford
with statues, too, in every niche
of course monsieur van stann is rich
and lives, i warrant, like a king
ah! wealth mast be a charming thing
in amsterdam the frenchman meets
a thousand wonders in the streets
but most he marvels to behold
a lady dressed in silk and gold
gazing with rapture on the dame
he begs to know the lady's name
and hears, to raise his wonders more
the very words he heard before
milord has got a charming wife
must be a very happy man
next day our tourist chanced to pop
his head within a lottery shop
and there he saw, with staring eyes
the drawing of the mammoth prize
i wish i had as much at home
i'd like to know, as i'm a sinner
what lucky fellow is the winner
conceive our traveler's amaze
to hear again the hackneyed phrase
faith! he's the luckiest of men
you may be sure we don't advance
so rapidly as that in france
a house, the finest in the land
a lovely garden, nicely planned
a perfect angel of a wife
and gold enough to last a life
there never yet was mortal man
so blest--as monsieur nick van stann
next day the frenchman chanced to meet
a pompous funeral in the street
and, asking one who stood close by
what nobleman had pleased to die
was stunned to hear the old reply
the frenchman sighed and shook his head
with such a house, and such a wife
it must be hard to part with life
and then, to lose that mammoth prize
he wins, and, pop,--the winner dies
ah, well! his blessings came so fast
i greatly feared they could not last
and thus, we see, the sword of fate
cuts down alike the small and great
marching down to armageddon
brothers, stout and strong
let us cheer the way we tread on
with a soldier's song
faint we by the weary road
or fall we in the rout
dirge or pæan, death or triumph
let the song ring out
we are they who scorn the scorners
love the lovers--hate
none within the world's four corners
all must share one fate
we are they whose common banner
bears no badge nor sign
save the light which dyes it white
the hope that makes it shine
we are they whose bugle rings
that all the wars may cease
we are they will pay the kings
their cruel price for peace
we are they whose steadfast watchword
is what christ did teach
and heaven, then, for each
we are they who will not falter
many swords or few
till we make this earth the altar
of a worship new
we are they who will not take
from palace, priest or code
a meaner law than "brotherhood
a lower lord than god
marching down to armageddon
brothers, stout and strong
ask not why the way we tread on
is so rough and long
god will tell us when our spirits
grow to grasp his plan
let us do our part to-day
and help him, helping man
shall we even curse the madness
which for "ends of state
dooms us to the long, long sadness
of this human hate
let us slay in perfect pity
those that must not live
vanquish, and forgive our foes
or fall--and still forgive
we are those whose unpaid legions
in free ranks arrayed
massacred in many regions
never once were stayed
we are they whose torn battalions
trained to bleed, not fly
make our agonies a triumph
conquer, while we die
therefore, down to armageddon
brothers, bold and strong
cheer the glorious way we tread on
with this soldier song
let the armies of the old flags
march in silent dread
death and life are one to us
who fight for quick and dead
it was a sergeant old and gray
well singed and bronzed from siege and pillage
went tramping in an army's wake
along the turnpike of the village
for days and nights the winding host
had through the little place been marching
and ever loud the rustics cheered
till every throat was hoarse and parching
the squire and farmer, maid and dame
all took the sight's electric stirring
and hats were waved and staves were sung
and kerchiefs white were countless whirring
they only saw a gallant show
of heroes stalwart under banners
and, in the fierce heroic glow
the sergeant heard the shrill hurrahs
where he behind in step was keeping
but, glancing down beside the road
he saw a little maid sit weeping
a moment pausing to regard her
and then she only cried the harder
the sturdy trooper straight repeated
that you, in tears, apart are seated
and that's a sight, my baby beauty
to quicken silence into song
and glorify the soldier's duty
the little maid gave soft replying
all say 'hurrah' while i am crying
how many little sisters' brothers
are going all away to fight
and may be killed, as well as others
his brawny hand her curls caressing
to find that war's not all a blessing
and "bless thee!" once again he cried
then cleared his throat and looked indignant
and marched away with wrinkled brow
to stop the struggling tear benignant
and still the ringing shouts went up
from doorway, thatch, and fields of tillage
the pall behind the standard seen
by one alone of all the village
the oak and cedar bend and writhe
when roars the wind through gap and braken
but 'tis the tenderest reed of all
that trembles first when earth is shaken
once in persia reigned a king
who upon his signet ring
graved a maxim true and wise
which, if held before his eyes
gave him counsel at a glance
fit for every change and chance
solemn words; and these are they
trains of camels through the sand
brought him gems from samarcand
fleets of galleys through the seas
brought him pearls to match with these
but he counted not his gain
treasurer of the mine and main
in the revels of his court
at the zenith of the sport
when the palms of all his guests
burned with clapping at his jests
he, amid his figs and wine
cried: "o loving friends of mine
pleasures come, but not to stay
even this shall pass away
fighting on a furious field
once a javelin pierced his shield
soldiers with loud lament
bore him bleeding to his tent
groaning with his tortured side
even this shall pass away
struck with palsy, sere and old
waiting at the gates of gold
spake he with his dying breath
then, in answer to the king
fell a sunbeam on his ring
showing by a heavenly ray
you're going to leave the homestead, john
you're twenty-one to-day
and very sorry am i, john
to see you go away
you've labored late and early, john
and done the best you could
i ain't going to stop you, john
i wouldn't if i could
yet something of your feelings, john
i s'pose i'd ought to know
though many a day has passed away
when hope was high within me, john
and life lay all before
that i, with strong and measured stroke
the years they come and go, my boy
the years they come and go
and raven locks and tresses brown
grow white as driven snow
my life has known its sorrows, john
its trials and troubles sore
yet god withal has blessed me, john
but one thing let me tell you, john
before you make a start
there's more in being honest, john
twice o'er than being smart
though rogues may seem to flourish, john
and sterling worth to fail
oh! keep in view the good and true
don't think too much of money, john
and dig and delve and plan
and rake and scrape in every shape
to hoard up all you can
though fools may count their riches, john
in dollars and in cents
the best of wealth is youth and health
and good sound common sense
and don't be mean and stingy, john
but lay a little by
of what you earn; you soon will learn
how fast 'twill multiply
so when old age comes creeping on
you'll have a goodly store
of wealth to furnish all your needs
and maybe something more
there's shorter cuts to fortune, john
we see them every day
but those who save their self-respect
climb up the good old way
and makes the vulgar stare
and those we deem the richest, john
have oft the least to spare
don't meddle with your neighbors, john
their sorrows or their cares
you'll find enough to do, my boy
to mind your own affairs
the world is full of idle tongues
you can afford to shirk
there's lots of people ready, john
to do such dirty work
and if amid the race for fame
you win a shining prize
the humbler work of honest men
you never should despise
for each one has his mission, john
in life's unchanging plan
though lowly be his station, john
he is no less a man
be good, be pure, be noble, john
be honest, brave, be true
and do to others as you would
that they should do to you
and put your trust in god, my boy
though fiery darts be hurled
then you can smile at satan's rage
and face a frowning world
good-by! may heaven guard and bless
your footsteps day by day
the old house will be lonesome, john
when you are gone away
the cricket's song upon the hearth
will have a sadder tone
the old familiar spots will be
so lonely when you're gone
king alphonso of asturias had imprisoned the count saldana, about the
time of the birth of the count's son bernardo. in an effort to secure
his father's release, bernardo, when old enough, took up arms. finally
the king offered bernardo possession of his father's person, in exchange
for the castle of carpio and all the king's subjects there imprisoned
the cruel trick played by the king on bernardo is here described
the warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire
and sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire
i pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!--oh break my father's chain
mount thy good horse; and thou and i will meet him on his way
then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed
and urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed
and lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band
with one that midst them stately rode, as leader in the land
the father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see
his dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's hue came and
he reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there, dismounting, bent
a lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took
what was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook
that hand was cold,--a frozen thing,--it dropped from his like lead
he looked up to the face above,--the face was of the dead
a plume waved o'er the noble brow,--the brow was fixed and white
he met, at last, his father's eyes, but in them was no sight
up from the ground he sprang and gazed, but who could paint that gaze
they hushed their very hearts that saw its horror and amaze
they might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood
for the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood
talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men
he thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young renown
he flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down
then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow
my king is false, my hope betrayed, my father--oh, the worth
the glory, and the loveliness, are passed away from earth
i thought to stand where banners waved, my sire, beside thee, yet
i would that there our kindred blood on spain's free soil had met
thou wouldst have known my spirit then;--for thee my fields were won
and thou hast perished in thy chains, as though thou hadst no son
then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch's rein
amidst the pale and 'wildered looks of all the courtier train
and, with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led
and sternly set them face to face, the king before the dead
be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this
the voice, the glance, the heart i sought--give answer, where are they
if thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold clay
into these glassy eyes put light; be still! keep down thine ire
bid these white lips a blessing speak, this earth is not my sire
give me back him for whom i strove, for whom my blood was shed
thou canst not?--and a king!--his dust be mountains on thy head
he loosed the steed--his slack hand fell; upon the silent face
he cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place
his hope was crushed, his after fate untold in martial strain
his banner led the spears no more, amidst the hills of spain
go thou thy way, and i go mine
apart--but not afar
only a thin veil hangs between
the pathways where we are
and god keep watch 'tween thee and me
this is my prayer
he looks thy way--he looketh mine
and keeps us near
i know not where thy road may lie
nor which way mine will be
if thine will lead through parching sands
and mine beside the sea
yet god keeps watch 'tween thee and me
so never fear
he holds thy hand--he claspeth mine
and keeps us near
should wealth and fame perchance be thine
and my lot lowly be
or you be sad and sorrowful
and glory be for me
yet god keep watch 'tween thee and me
both are his care
one arm round me and one round thee
will keep us near
i sigh sometimes to see thy face
but since this may not be
i leave thee to the love of him
who cares for thee and me
this comforts--dear
one wing o'er thee--and one o'er me
so we are near
and though our paths be separate
and thy way be not mine
yet coming to the mercy seat
my soul shall meet with thine
and "god keep watch 'tween thee and me
i'll whisper there
he blesses me--he blesses thee
and we are near
o thou eternal one! whose presence bright
all space doth occupy, all motion guide
unchanged through time's all-devastating flight
thou only god--there is no god beside
being above all beings! mighty one
whom none can comprehend and none explore
who fill'st existence with thyself alone
embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er
being whom we call god, and know no more
in its sublime research, philosophy
may measure out the ocean-deep--may count
the sands or the sun's rays--but, god! for thee
there is no weight nor measure; none can mount
up to thy mysteries:* reason's brightest spark
though kindled by thy light, in vain would try
to trace thy counsels, infinite and dark
and thought is lost ere thought can soar so high
even like past moments in eternity
thou from primeval nothingness didst call
first chaos, then existence--lord! in thee
eternity had its foundation; all
sprung forth from thee--of light, joy, harmony
sole origin--all life, all beauty thine
thy word created all, and doth create
thy splendor fills all space with rays divine
thou art and wert and shalt be! glorious! great
light-giving, life-sustaining potentate
thy chains the unmeasured universe surround
upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath
thou the beginning with the end hast bound
and beautifully mingled life and death
as sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze
so suns are born, so worlds spring forth from thee
and as the spangles in the sunny rays
shine round the silver snow, the pageantry
of heaven's bright army glitters in thy praise
a million torches, lighted by thy hand
wander unwearied through the blue abyss
they own thy power, accomplish thy command
all gay with life, all eloquent with bliss
what shall we call them? piles of crystal light
a glorious company of golden streams
lamps of celestial ether burning bright
suns lighting systems with their joyous beams
but thou to these art as the noon to night
yes! as a drop of water in the sea
all this magnificence in thee is lost
what are ten thousand worlds compared to thee
and what am i then?--heaven's unnumbered host
though multiplied by myriads, and arrayed
in all the glory of sublimest thought
is but an atom in the balance, weighed
against thy greatness--is a cipher brought
against infinity! what am i then? naught
naught! but the effluence of thy light divine
pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too
yes! in my spirit doth thy spirit shine
as shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew
naught! but i live, and on hope's pinions fly
eager toward thy presence; for in thee
i live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high
even to the throne of thy divinity
i am, o god! and surely thou must be
thou art!--directing, guiding all--thou art
direct my understanding then to thee
control my spirit, guide my wandering heart
though but an atom midst immensity
still i am something, fashioned by thy hand
i hold a middle rank 'twixt heaven and earth
on the last verge of mortal being stand
close to the realm where angels have their birth
just on the boundaries of the spirit-land
the chain of being is complete in me
in me is matter's last gradation lost
and the next step is spirit--deity
i can command the lightning, and am dust
a monarch and a slave--a worm, a god
whence came i here, and how? so marvelously
constructed and conceived? unknown! this clod
lives surely through some higher energy
for from itself alone it could not be
creator, yes! thy wisdom and thy word
created me! thou source of life and good
thou spirit of my spirit, and my lord
thy light, thy love, in their bright plenitude
filled me with an immortal soul, to spring
over the abyss of death; and bade it wear
the garments of eternal day, and wing
its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere
even to its source--to thee--its author there
o thoughts ineffable! o visions blest
though worthless our conceptions all of thee
yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breast
and waft its homage to thy deity
god! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar
thus seek thy presence--being wise and good
midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore
and when the tongue is eloquent no more
the soul shall speak in tears of gratitude
the boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but him had fled
the flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone round him o'er the dead
yet beautiful and bright he stood
as born to rule the storm
a creature of heroic blood
a proud, though childlike form
the flames roll'd on--he would not go
without his father's word
that father, faint in death below
his voice no longer heard
he called aloud: "say, father, say
if yet my task is done
he knew not that the chieftain lay
unconscious of his son
and but the booming shots replied
and fast the flames roll'd on
upon his brow he felt their breath
and in his waving hair
and looked from that lone post of death
in still, yet brave despair
and shouted but once more aloud
while o'er him fast, through sail and shroud
the wreathing fires made way
they wrapt the ship in splendor wild
they caught the flag on high
and streamed above the gallant child
like banners in the sky
there came a burst of thunder sound
the boy--oh! where was he
ask of the winds that far around
with fragments strewed the sea
with mast, and helm, and pennon fair
that well had borne their part
but the noblest thing that perished there
was that young, faithful heart
we were not many,--we who stood
before the iron sleet that day
yet many a gallant spirit would
give half his years if he but could
have been with us at monterey
now here, now there, the shot it hailed
in deadly drifts of fiery spray
yet not a single soldier quailed
when wounded comrades round them wailed
their dying shout at monterey
and on, still on our column kept
through walls of flame, its withering way
where fell the dead, the living stept
still charging on the guns which swept
the slippery streets of monterey
the foe himself recoiled aghast
when, striking where he strongest lay
we swooped his flanking batteries past
and braving full their murderous blast
stormed home the towers of monterey
our banners on those turrets wave
and there our evening bugles play
where orange boughs above their grave
keep green the memory of the brave
who fought and fell at monterey
we are not many, we who pressed
beside the brave who fell that day
but who of us has not confessed
he'd rather share their warrior rest
than not have been at monterey
if you can take your dreams into the classroom
and always make them part of each day's work
if you can face the countless petty problems
nor turn from them nor ever try to shirk
if you can live so that the child you work with
deep in his heart knows you to be a man
if you can take "i can't" from out his language
and put in place a vigorous "i can
if you can take love with you to the classroom
and yet on firmness never shut the door
if you can teach a child the love of nature
so that he helps himself to all her store
if you can teach him life is what we make it
that he himself can be his only bar
if you can tell him something of the heavens
or something of the wonder of a star
if you, with simple bits of truth and honor
his better self occasionally reach
and yet not overdo nor have him dub you
as one who is inclined to ever preach
if you impart to him a bit of liking
for all the wondrous things we find in print
yet have him understand that to be happy
play, exercise, fresh air he must not stint
if you can give of all the best that's in you
and in the giving always happy be
if you can find the good that's hidden somewhere
deep in the heart of every child you see
if you can do these things and all the others
that teachers everywhere do every day
you're in the work that you were surely meant for
take hold of it! know it's your place and stay
there were ninety and nine
of a flock, sleek and fine
in a sheltering cote in the vale
but a lamb was away
on the mountain astray
unprotected within the safe pale
then the sleet and the rain
on the mountain and plain
and the wind fiercely blowing a gale
and the night's growing dark
and the wolf's hungry bark
stir the soul of the shepherd so hale
and he says, "hireling, go
for a lamb's in the snow
and exposed to the wild hungry beast
nor to rest weary feet
nor to sit at a bounteous feast
then the hireling replied
all your flock save this one little sheep
are the ninety and nine
all so safe and so fine
not enough for the shepherd to keep
then the shepherd replied
presses near, very near, to my heart
not its value in pay
makes me urge in this way
but the longings and achings of heart
o good shepherd, i pray
for i shudder to go in the dark
on the mountain so high
and its precipice nigh
then the shepherd said, "no
surely some one must go
who can rescue my lamb from the cold
from the wolf's hungry maw
and the lion's fierce paw
and restore it again to the fold
then the shepherd goes out
with his cloak girt about
and his rod and his staff in his hand
what cares he for the cold
if his sheep to the fold
he can bring from the dark mountain land
you can hear his clear voice
as the mountains rejoice
up the hillside so steep
into caverns so deep
now he hears its weak "baa
and he answers it, "ah
sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep
then its answering bleat
hurries on his glad feet
and his arms gather up his lost sheep
wet and cold on his breast
the lost lamb found its rest
as he bore it adown to the fold
and the ninety and nine
bleat for joy down the line
that it's safe from the wolf and the cold
then he said to his friends
for the steeps and the deeps i have crossed
for the pelting of sleet
and my sore, weary feet
for i've found the dear lamb that was lost
let the hirelings upbraid
for the nights that he stayed
on the mountains so rugged and high
surely never a jeer
from my lips shall one hear
while the eons shall roll
o'er my glad ransomed soul
i will praise the good shepherd above
for a place on his breast
for its comfort and rest
for his wonderful, wonderful love
if you have a friend worth loving
love him. yes, and let him know
that you love him ere life's evening
tinge his brow with sunset glow
why should good words ne'er be said
of a friend--till he is dead
if you hear a song that thrills you
sung by any child of song
praise it. do not let the singer
wait deserved praises long
why should one that thrills your heart
lack that joy it may impart
if you hear a prayer that moves you
by its humble pleading tone
join it. do not let the seeker
bow before his god alone
why should not your brother share
the strength of "two or three" in prayer
if you see the hot tears falling
from a loving brother's eyes
share them, and by sharing
own your kinship with the skies
why should anyone be glad
when his brother's heart is sad
if a silver laugh goes rippling
through the sunshine on his face
share it. 'tis the wise man's saying
for both grief and joy a place
there's health and goodness in the mirth
in which an honest laugh has birth
if your work is made more easy
by a friendly helping hand
say so. speak out brave and truly
ere the darkness veil the land
should a brother workman dear
falter for a word of cheer
scatter thus your seed of kindness
all enriching as you go
leave them, trust the harvest-giver
he will make each seed to grow
so, until its happy end
your life shall never lack a friend
you sail and you seek for the fortunate isles
the old greek isles of the yellow bird's song
then steer right on through the watery miles
straight on, straight on, and you can't go wrong
nay, not to the left, nay, not to the right
but on, straight on, and the isles are in sight
the fortunate isles, where the yellow birds sing
and life lies girt with a golden ring
these fortunate isles, they are not far
they lie within reach of the lowliest door
you can see them gleam by the twilight star
you can hear them sing by the moon's white shore
nay, never look back! those leveled gravestones
they were landing steps; they were steps unto thrones
of glory for souls that have sailed before
and have set white feet on the fortunate shore
and what are the names of the fortunate isles
why, duty and love and a large content
lo! there are the isles of the watery miles
that god let down from the firmament
lo! duty and love, and a true man's trust
your forehead to god and your feet in the dust
lo! duty and love, and a sweet babe's smiles
and there, o friend, are the fortunate isles
a foolish little maiden bought a foolish little bonnet
with a ribbon, and a feather, and a bit of lace upon it
and that the other maidens of the little town might know it
she thought she'd go to meeting the next sunday just to show it
but though the little bonnet was scarce larger than a dime
the getting of it settled proved to be a work of time
so when 'twas fairly tied, all the bells had stopped their ringing
and when she came to meeting, sure enough the folks were singing
so this foolish little maiden stood and waited at the door
and she shook her ruffles out behind and smoothed them down before
this made the little maiden feel so very, very cross
that she gave her little mouth a twist, her little head a toss
for she thought the very hymn they sang was all about her bonnet
with the ribbon, and the feather, and the bit of lace upon it
and she would not wait to listen to the sermon or the prayer
but pattered down the silent street, and hurried up the stair
till she reached her little bureau, and in a band-box on it
had hidden, safe from critics' eyes, her foolish little bonnet
which proves, my little maidens, that each of you will find
in every sabbath service but an echo of your mind
and the silly little head, that's filled with silly little airs
will never get a blessing from sermon or from prayers
work thou for pleasure; paint or sing or carve
the thing thou lovest, though the body starve
who works for glory misses oft the goal
who works for money coins his very soul
work for work's sake then, and it well may be
that these things shall be added unto thee
i was strolling one day down the lawther arcade
that place for children's toys
where you can purchase a dolly or spade
for your good little girls and boys
and as i passed a certain stall, said a wee little voice to me
o, i am a colonel in a little cocked hat, and i ride on a tin gee gee
o, i am a colonel in a little cocked hat, and i ride on a tin gee gee
then i looked and a little tin soldier i saw
in his little cocked hat so fine
he'd a little tin sword that shone in the light
as he led a glittering line of tin hussars
whose sabers flashed in a manner à la military
and that little tin soldier he rode at their head
so proud on his tin gee gee
then that little tin soldier he sobbed and he sighed
so i patted his little tin head
and this is what he said
i've been on this stall a very long time
and i'm marked twenty-nine, as you see
whilst just on the shelf above my head
there's a fellow marked sixty-three
now he hasn't got a sword and he hasn't got a horse
and i'm quite as good as he
so why mark me at twenty-nine
and him at sixty-three
there's a pretty little dolly girl over there
and i'm madly in love with she
but now that i'm only marked twenty-nine
she turns up her nose at me
she turns up her little wax nose at me
and carries on with sixty-three
and, oh, she's dressed in a beautiful dress
it's a dress i do admire
she has pearly blue eyes that open and shut
when worked inside by a wire
and once on a time when the folks had gone
she used to ogle at me
but now that i'm only marked twenty-nine

the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
foot and treadle
hand and pedal
upward, downward, hither, thither
how the weaver makes them go

up and down the web is plying
and across the woof is flying
what a rattling
what a battling
what a shuffling
what a scuffling
as the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
threads in single, threads in double
how they mingle, what a trouble
every color, what profusion
every motion, what confusion
while the web and woof are mingling
signal bells above are jingling
telling how each figure ranges
telling when the color changes
as the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
well the weaver seems to know
as he makes his shuttle go
what each motion

what each fusion

in the grand result will show
weaving daily
singing gaily
as he makes his busy shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
the weaver at his loom is sitting
throws his shuttle to and fro
see you not how shape and order
from the wild confusion grow
as he makes his shuttle go
as the web and woof diminish
grows beyond the beauteous finish
tufted plaidings
shapes, and shadings
all the mystery
now is history
and we see the reason subtle
why the weaver makes his shuttle
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
see the mystic weaver sitting
high in heaven--his loom below
up and down the treadles go
takes for web the world's long ages
takes for woof its kings and sages
takes the nobles and their pages
takes all stations and all stages
thrones are bobbins in his shuttle
armies make them scud and scuttle
web into the woof must flow
up and down the nations go
as the weaver wills they go
men are sparring
powers are jarring
upward, downward, hither, thither
just like puppets in a show
up and down the web is plying

finished work behind, in weaving
see you not the reason subtle
as the web and woof diminish
changing into beauteous finish
hither, thither, scud and scuttle
glorious wonder! what a weaving
to the dull beyond believing
such, no fabled ages know
only _faith_ can see the mystery
how, along the aisle of history
where the feet of sages go
loveliest to the purest eyes
grand the mystic tapet lies
soft and smooth, and even spreading
every figure has its plaidings
as if made for angels' treading
tufted circles touching ever
inwrought figures fading never
brighter form and softer shadings
each illumined,--what a riddle
from a cross that gems the middle
that its light is all reflected
that the tapet's hues are given
by a sun that shines in heaven
that great god himself is weaving
bringing out the world's dark mystery
in the light of truth and history
and as web and woof diminish
comes the grand and glorious finish
when begin the golden ages
long foretold by seers and sages
and when the world was light and gay, i could not even smile
it stood before me like a giant, outstretched its iron arm
no matter where i looked, i saw the mortgage on the farm
i'll tell you how it happened, for i want the world to know
how glad i am this winter day whilst earth is white with snow
i'm just as happy as a lark. no cause for rude alarm
confronts us now, for lifted is the mortgage on the farm
the children they were growing up and they were smart and trim
to some big college in the east we'd sent our youngest, jim
and every time he wrote us, at the bottom of his screed
he tacked some latin fol-de-rol which none of us could read
the girls they ran to music, and to painting, and to rhymes
they said the house was out of style and far behind the times
they suddenly diskivered that it didn't keep'm warm
another step of course towards a mortgage on the farm
we took a cranky notion, hannah jane and me one day
while we were coming home from town, a-talking all the way
the old house wasn't big enough for us, although for years
beneath its humble roof we'd shared each other's joys and tears
we built it o'er and when 'twas done, i wish you could have seen it
it was a most tremendous thing--i really didn't mean it
why, it was big enough to hold the people of the town
and not one half as cosy as the old one we pulled down
i bought a fine pianner and it shortened still the pile
but, then, it pleased the children and they banged it all the while
no matter what they played for me, their music had no charm
for every tune said plainly: "there's a mortgage on the farm
i worked from morn till eve, and toiled as often toils the slave
to meet that grisly interest; i tried hard to be brave
and oft when i came home at night with tired brain and arm
the chickens hung their heads, they felt the mortgage on the farm
but we saved a penny now and then, we laid them in a row
the girls they played the same old tunes, and let the new ones go
and when from college came our jim with laurels on his brow
i led him to the stumpy field and put him to the plow
he something said in latin which i didn't understand
but it did me good to see his plow turn up the dewy land
and when the year had ended and empty were the cribs
we found we'd hit the mortgage, sir, a blow between the ribs
to-day i harnessed up the team and thundered off to town
and in the lawyer's sight i planked the last bright dollar down
and when i trotted up the lanes a-feeling good and warm
the old red rooster crowed his best: "no mortgage on the farm
i'll sleep almighty good to-night, the best for many a day
the skeleton that haunted us has passed fore'er away
the girls can play the brand-new tunes with no fears to alarm
and jim can go to congress, with no mortgage on the farm
that is what the vision said
in his chamber all alone
kneeling on the floor of stone
prayed the monk in deep contrition
for his sins of indecision
prayed for greater self-denial
in temptation and in trial
it was noonday by the dial
and the monk was all alone
suddenly, as if it lightened
an unwonted splendor brightened
all within him and without him
in that narrow cell of stone
and he saw the blessed vision
of our lord, with light elysian
like a vesture wrapped about him
like a garment round him thrown
not as crucified and slain
not in agonies of pain
not with bleeding hands and feet
did the monk his master see
but as in the village street
in the house or harvest field
halt and lame and blind he healed
when he walked in galilee
in as attitude imploring
hands upon his bosom crossed
wondering, worshiping, adoring
knelt the monk, in rapture lost
lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest
who am i that thus thou deignest
to reveal thyself to me
who am i, that from the center
of thy glory thou shouldst enter
this poor cell, my guest to be
then amid his exaltation
loud the convent bell appalling
from its belfrey calling, calling
rang through court and corridor
with persistent iteration
he had never heard before
it was now the appointed hour
when alike in shine or shower
winter's cold or summer's heat
to the convent portals came
all the blind and halt and lame
all the beggars of the street
for their daily dole of food
dealt them by the brotherhood
and their almoner was he
who upon his bended knees
rapt in silent ecstasy
of divinest self-surrender
saw the vision and the splendor
deep distress and hesitation
mingled with his adoration
should he go, or should he stay
should he leave the poor to wait
hungry at the convent gate
till the vision passed away
should he slight his radiant guest
slight this visitant celestial
for a crowd of ragged, bestial
beggars at the convent gate
would the vision there remain
would the vision come again
then a voice within his breast
whispered audible and clear
as if to the outward ear
leave unto thy lord the rest
straightway to his feet he started
and with longing look intent
on the blessed vision bent
slowly from his cell departed
slowly on his errand went
at the gate the poor were waiting
looking through the iron grating
with that terror in the eye
that is only seen in those
who amid their wants and woes
hear the sound of doors that close
and of feet that pass them by
grown familiar with disfavor
grown familiar with the savor
of the bread by which men die
but to-day, they knew not why
like the gate of paradise
seemed the convent gate to rise
like a sacrament divine
seemed to them the bread and wine
in his heart the monk was praying
thinking of the homeless poor
what they suffer and endure
what we see not, what we see
and the inward voice was saying
to the least of mine and lowest
that thou doest unto me
unto me! but had the vision
come to him in beggar's clothing
come a mendicant imploring
would he then have knelt adoring
or have listened with derision
and have turned away with loathing
thus his conscience put the question
full of troublesome suggestion
as at length, with hurried pace
toward his cell he turned his face
and beheld the convent bright
with a supernatural light
like a luminous cloud expanding
over floor and wall and ceiling
but he paused with awe-struck feeling
at the threshold of his door
for the vision still was standing
as he left it there before
when the convent bell appalling
from its belfry calling, calling
summoned him to feed the poor
through the long hour intervening
it had waited his return
and he felt his bosom burn
comprehending all the meaning
when the blessed vision said
into a ward of the whitewashed halls
where the dead and dying lay
wounded by bayonets, shells, and balls
somebody's darling was borne one day
somebody's darling, so young and so brave
wearing yet on his pale, sweet face
soon to be hid by the dust of the grave
the lingering light of his boyhood's grace
matted and damp are the curls of gold
kissing the snow of the fair young brow
pale are the lips of delicate mold
somebody's darling is dying now
back from his beautiful blue-veined brow
brush all the wandering waves of gold
cross his hands on his bosom now
somebody's darling is still and cold
kiss him once for somebody's sake
murmur a prayer both soft and low
one bright curl from its fair mates take
they were somebody's pride, you know
somebody's hand hath rested there
was it a mother's, soft and white
and have the lips of a sister fair
been baptized in their waves of light
god knows best! he was somebody's love
somebody's heart enshrined him there
somebody wafted his name above
night and morn on the wings of prayer
somebody wept when he marched away
looking so handsome, brave, and grand
somebody's kiss on his forehead lay
somebody clung to his parting hand
somebody's waiting and watching for him
yearning to hold him again to her heart
and there he lies with his blue eyes dim
and the smiling, child-like lips apart
tenderly bury the fair young dead
pausing to drop on his grave a tear
carve in the wooden slab at his head
south mountain towered upon our right, far off the river lay
and over on the wooded height we held their lines at bay
at last the muttering guns were still; the day died slow and wan
at last the gunners pipes did fill, the sergeant's yarns began
when, as the wind a moment blew aside the fragrant flood
our brierwoods raised, within our view a little maiden stood
a tiny tot of six or seven, from fireside fresh she seemed
and as we stared, her little hand went to her curly head
in grave salute. "and who are _you_?" at length the sergeant said
my home? why, that was burned away, and pa and ma are dead
and so i ride the guns all day along with sergeant ned
and i've a drum that's not a toy, a cap with feathers, too
and i march beside the drummer boy on sundays at review
but now our 'bacca's all give out, the men can't have their smoke
and so they're cross--why, even ned won't play with me and joke
and the big colonel said to-day--i hate to hear him swear
he'd give a leg for a good pipe like the yanks had over there
and so i thought when beat the drum,  and the big guns were still
i'd creep beneath the tent and come out here across the hill
and beg, good mister yankee men, you'd give me some 'lone jack
please do: when we get some again, i'll surely bring it back
indeed i will, for ned--says he,--if i do what i say
i'll be a general yet, maybe, and ride a prancing bay
we brimmed her tiny apron o'er; you should have heard her laugh
as each man from his scanty store shook out a generous half
to kiss the little mouth stooped down a score of grimy men
until the sergeant's husky voice said,"'tention squad!" and then
we gave her escort, till good-night the pretty waif we bid
and watched her toddle out of sight--or else 'twas tears that hid
her tiny form--nor turned about a man, nor spoke a word
till after awhile a far, hoarse shout upon the wind we heard
we sent it back, then cast sad eyes upon the scene around
a baby's hand had touched the ties that brothers once had bound
that's all--save when the dawn awoke again the work of hell
and through the sullen clouds of smoke the screaming missiles fell
our general often rubbed his glass, and marveled much to see
it was kept out in the kitchen, and 'twas long and deep and wide
and the poker hung above it and the shovel stood beside
and the big, black cookstove, grinnin' through its grate from ear to ear
seemed to look as if it loved it like a brother, pretty near
flowered oilcloth tacked around it kept its cracks and knot-holes hid
and a pair of leather hinges fastened on the heavy lid
and it hadn't any bottom--or, at least, it seemed that way
when you hurried in to fill it, so's to get outside and play
when the noons was hot and lazy and the leaves hung dry and still
and the locust in the pear tree started up his planin'-mill
and the drum-beat of the breakers was a soothin', temptin' roll
and you knew the "gang" was waitin' by the brimmin' "swimmin' hole
louder than the locust's buzzin,' louder than the breakers' roar
you could hear the wood-box holler, "come and fill me up once more
and the old clock ticked and chuckled as you let each armful drop
like it said, "another minute, and you're nowheres near the top
in the chilly winter mornin's when the bed was snug and warm
and the frosted winders tinkled 'neath the fingers of the storm
and your breath rose off the piller in a smoky cloud of steam
then that wood-box, grim and empty, came a-dancin' through your dream
came and pounded at your conscience, screamed in aggravatin' glee
land! how plain it is this minute--shed and barn and drifted snow
and the slabs of oak a-waitin!, piled and ready, in a row
never was a fishin' frolic, never was a game of ball
but that mean, provokin' wood-box had to come and spoil it all
you might study at your lessons and 'twas full and full to stay
but jest start an injun story, and 'twas empty right away
seemed as if a spite was in it, and although i might forgit
all the other chores that plagued me, i can hate that wood-box yit
and when i look back at boyhood--shakin' off the cares of men
still it comes to spoil the picture, screamin', "fill me up again
good deacon roland--"may his tribe increase
awoke one sabbath morn feeling at peace
with god and all mankind. his wants supplied
he read his bible and then knelt beside
the family altar, and uplifted there
his voice to god in fervent praise and prayer
in praise for blessings past, so rich and free
and prayer for benedictions yet to be
then on a stile, which spanned the dooryard fence
he sat him down complacently, and thence
surveyed with pride, o'er the far-reaching plain
his flocks and herds and fields of golden grain
his meadows waving like the billowy seas
and orchards filled with over-laden trees
quoth he: "how vast the products of my lands
abundance crowns the labor of my hands
great is my substance; god indeed is good
who doth in love provide my daily food
while thus he sat in calm soliloquy
a voice aroused him from his reverie
a childish voice from one whose shoeless feet
brought him unnoticed to the deacon's seat
if i had money i would gladly pay
for bread; but i am poor, and cannot buy
should ask for something, just for what you call
cold pieces from your table, that is all
the deacon listened to the child's request
the while his penetrating eye did rest
on him whose tatters, trembling, quick revealed
the agitation of the heart concealed
within the breast of one unskilled in ruse
who asked not alms like one demanding dues
then said the deacon: "i am not inclined
to give encouragement to those who find
it easier to beg for bread betimes
than to expend their strength in earning dimes
wherewith to purchase it. a parent ought
to furnish food for those whom he has brought
into this world, where each one has his share
of tribulation, sorrow, toil and care
i sympathize with you, my little lad
your destitution makes me feel so sad
but, for the sake of those who should supply
your wants, i must your earnest plea deny
and inasmuch as giving food to you
would be providing for your parents, too
thus fostering vagrancy and idleness
i cannot think such charity would bless
who gives or takes; and therefore i repeat
i cannot give you anything to eat
before this "vasty deep" of logic stood
the child nor found it satisfying food
nor did he tell the tale he might have told
of parents slumbering in the grave's damp mould
but quickly shrank away to find relief
in giving vent to his rekindled grief
while deacon roland soon forgot the appeal
in meditating on his better weal
ere long the sabbath bells their peals rang out
to summon worshippers, with hearts devout
to wait on god and listen to his word
and then the deacon's pious heart was stirred
and in the house of god he soon was found
engaged in acts of worship most profound
wearied, however, with his week-day care
he fell asleep before the parson's prayer
was ended; then he dreamed he died and came
to heaven's grand portal, and announced his name
to join the saints; please set the gates ajar
that i may 'join the everlasting song
and mingle ever with the ransomed throng
then lo! "a horror of great darkness" came
upon him, as he heard a voice exclaim
i never knew you, for indeed, howe'er
you may have wrought on earth, the sad, sad fact
remains, that life's sublimest, worthiest act
the deacon woke to find it all a dream
just as the minister announced his theme
as practice charity; for 'inasmuch
as ye have done it to the least of these
my little ones' saith he who holds the keys
of heaven, 'ye have done it unto me
and i will give you immortality
straightway the deacon left his cushioned pew
and from the church in sudden haste withdrew
and up the highway ran, on love's swift feet
to overtake the child of woe, and greet
him as the worthy representative
of christ the lord and to him freely give
all needful good, that thus he might atone
for the neglect which he before had shown
thus journeying, god directed all his way
o'er hill and dale, to where the outcast lay
beside the road bemoaning his sad fate
and then the deacon said, "my child, 'tis late
make haste and journey with me to my home
to guide you thither, i myself have come
and you shall have the food you asked in vain
for god himself hath made my duty plain
if he demand it, all i have is thine
shrink not, but trust me; place thy hand in mine
and as they journeyed toward the deacon's home
the child related how he came to roam
until the listening deacon understood
the touching story of his orphanhood
then, finding in the little waif a gem
worthy to deck the saviour's diadem
he drew him to his loving breast, and said
nor shall you go from hence again to roam
while god in love provides for us a home
and as the weeks and months roll on apace
the deacon held the lad in love's embrace
and being childless did on him confer
the boon of sonship
thus the almoner
of god's great bounty to the destitute
the deacon came to be; and as the fruit
of having learned to keep the golden rule
his charity became all-bountiful
and from thenceforth he lived to benefit
mankind; and when in life's great book were writ
their names who heeded charity's request
lo! deacon roland's "name led all the rest
talking of sects quite late one eve
what one and another of saints believe
that night i stood in a troubled dream
by the side of a darkly-flowing stream
and a "churchman" down to the river came
when i heard a strange voice call his name
you must leave your robes on the other side
but the aged father did not mind
and his long gown floated out behind
as down to the stream his way he took
his hands firm hold of a gilt-edged book
i shall want my book of common prayer
and though i put on a starry crown
i should feel quite lost without my gown
then he fixed his eye on the shining track
but his gown was heavy and held him back
and the poor old father tried in vain
a single step in the flood to gain
i saw him again on the other side
but his silk gown floated on the tide
and no one asked, in that blissful spot
if he belonged to "the church" or not
then down to the river a quaker strayed
his dress of a sober hue was made
i cannot go any other way
then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin
and staidly, solemnly, waded in
and his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight
over his forehead, so cold and white
but a strong wind carried away his hat
and he sighed a few moments over that
and then, as he gazed to the farther shore
the coat slipped off and was seen no more
poor, dying quaker, thy suit of gray
is quietly sailing--away--away
but thou'lt go to heaven, as straight as an arrow
whether thy brim be broad or narrow
next came dr. watts with a bundle of psalms
tied nicely up in his aged arms
and hymns as many, a very wise thing
that the people in heaven, "all round," might sing
but i thought that he heaved an anxious sigh
as he saw that the river ran broad and high
and looked rather surprised, as one by one
the psalms and hymns in the wave went down
came wesley, the pattern of godliness
but he cried, "dear me, what shall i do
the water has soaked them through and through
and there, on the river, far and wide
away they went on the swollen tide
and the saint, astonished, passed through alone
without his manuscripts, up to the throne
then gravely walking, two saints by name
down to the stream together came
but as they stopped at the river's brink
i saw one saint from the other shrink
how you attained to life's great end
as i'm 'close communion,' to cross with you
you're bound, i know, to the realms of bliss
but you must go that way, and i'll go this
and straightway plunging with all his might
away to the left--his friend at the right
apart they went from this world of sin
but how did the brethren "enter in
and now where the river was rolling on
a presbyterian church went down
of women, there seemed an innumerable throng
but the men i could count as they passed along
and concerning the road they could never agree
the _old_ or the _new_ way, which it could be
nor ever a moment paused to think
that both would lead to the river's brink
and a sound of murmuring long and loud
came ever up from the moving crowd
that is the false, and this is the true
or, "i'm in the old way, and you're in the new
but the brethren only seemed to speak
modest the sisters walked, and meek
and if ever one of them chanced to say
what troubles she met with on the way
how she longed to pass to the other side
nor feared to cross over the swelling tide
a voice arose from the brethren then
for have ye not heard the words of paul
i watched them long in my curious dream
till they stood by the border of the stream
then, just as i thought, the two ways met
but all the brethren were talking yet
and would talk on, till the heaving tide
carried them over, side by side
side by side, for the way was one
the toilsome journey of life was done
and priest and quaker, and all who died
came out alike on the other side
no forms or crosses, or books had they
no gowns of silk, or suits of gray
for all had put on "christ's righteousness
i can't tell much about the thing, 'twas done so powerful quick
but 'pears to me i got a most outlandish heavy lick
it broke my leg, and tore my skulp, and jerked my arm 'most out
but take a seat: i'll try and tell jest how it kem about

and drivin' slow; for, jest about a day or two before

you know the railroad cuts across the road at martin's hole
well, thar i seed a great big sign, raised high upon a pole
i thought i'd stop and read the thing, and find out what it said
and so i stopped the hosses on the railroad-track, and read
i ain't no scholar, rekollect, and so i had to spell
and that spelt "rail" as clear as mud; r-o-a-d was "road
i lumped 'em: "railroad" was the word, and that 'ere much i knowed
c-r-o and double s, with i-n-g to boot
made "crossing" jest as plain as noah webster dared to do't
and i wos lookin' all the time, and spellin' like a book

it glorified the massive blocks caught in its widening flow
engulfed the maze of streets and parks that stretched away below
till marble white and foliage green and vales of gray, and silvery sheen
of ocean's surface vast, serene, were tinted by its glow
the tranquil murmurs of the deep were borne on balmy air
all odorous with lily breath and roses sweet and rare
the zephyrs sang a lullaby as the slow, fiery ball
ended its trail of gorgeousness behind horizon's wall
then gray absorbed each rainbow hue and dark the beauteous landscape grew
as shadowy evening softly drew her curtain over all
that night around the festal board, 'mid incandescence gay
sat pomp and pride and wealth and power, in sumptuous array
that night the happy, careless throng were all on pleasure bent
and beauty in her jewelled robes to ball and opera went
the sunset city sank to rest in peace, secure, content
unconscious of approaching doom, old san francisco sleeps
while from the east, all smilingly, the april morning creeps
see! playful sunbeams tinge with gold the mountains in the sky
and hazy clouds of gray unfold--but, hark! what means that cry
the ground vibrates with sadden shock. the buildings tremble, groan
and rock
wild fears the waking senses mock, and some wake but to die
a frightful subterranean force the earth's foundation shakes
the city quivers in the throes of fierce, successive quakes
and massive structures thrill like giant oaks before the blast
into the streets with deafening crash the frailer ones are cast
half garbed, the multitude rush out in frantic haste, with prayer and
shout
to join the panic stricken rout. ho! death is marching past
a rumbling noise! the streets upheave, and sink again, like waves
and shattered piles and shapeless wrecks are strewn with human graves
danger at every corner lurks. destruction fills the air
death-laden showers of mortar, bricks, are falling everywhere
to their hearts
are struggling for the open parts in frenzy of despair
a hundred tiny tongues of flame forth from the ruins burst
no water! god! what shall we do to slake their quenchless thirst
the shocks have broken all the mains! "_use wine!_" the people cry
the red flames laugh like drunken fiends; they stagger as to die
then up again in fury spring, on high their crimson draperies fling
from block to block they leap and swing, and smoke clouds hide the sky
ha! from the famed presidio that guards the golden gate
come funston and his regulars to match their strength with fate
the soldiers and the citizens are fighting side by side
to check that onslaught of red wrath, to stem destruction's tide
with roar, and boom, and blare, and blast, an open space is cleared at
the fiends of fury gallop past with flanks outstretched and wide
around the city's storehouses they wreathe and twine and dance
and wealth and splendor shrivel up before their swift advance
before their devastating breath the stricken people flee
into that vortex of red hell sink church and theatre, store, hotel
with thunderous roar and hissing yell on sweeps the crimson sea
again with charge of dynamite the lurid clouds are riven
again with heat and sulphur smoke the troops are backward driven
all day, all night, all day again, with that infernal host
they strive in vain for mastery. each vantage gained is lost
on comes the bellowing flood of flame in furious wrath its own to claim
resistless in its awful aim each space is bridged and crossed
ah god! the miles and miles of waste! one half the city gone
and westward now--toward van ness--the roaring flames roll on
and there, at broad van ness, the troops make their heroic stand
the fight is now for life--sweet life, for helpless babe and homeless
the culmination of the strife spectacularly grand
on sweeps the hurricane of fire. the fatal touch is given
the detonation of the blast goes shrieking up to heaven
the mansions of bonanza kings are tottering to their doom
that swirling tide of fiery fate halts at the gaping tomb
beyond the cataclysm's brink, the multitude, too dazed to think
behold the red waves rise and--sink into the smoldering gloom
the fire has swept the waterfront and burned the mission down
the business section--swallowed up, and wiped out chinatown
full thirty thousand homes destroyed, nob hill in ashes lies
and ghastly skeletons of steel on market street arise
a gruesome picture everywhere! 'tis desolation grim and bare
waits artisan and millionaire beneath rank sulphurous skies
to-night, within the city parks, famished, benumbed and mute
two hundred thousand refugees, homeless and destitute
upon the hard, cold ground they crouch--the wrecks of pomp and pride
milady and the city waifs are huddled side by side
and there, 'neath shelter rude and frail, we hear the new-born infants
while' nations read the tragic tale--how san francisco died
prophecy--1906
not dead! though maimed, her soul yet lives--indomitable will
the faith, the hope, the spirit bold nor quake nor fire can kill
to-morrow hearts shall throb again with western enterprise
and from the ruins of to-day a city shall arise
a monument of beauty great reared by the conquerors of fate
the city of the golden gate and matchless sunset skies
fulfillment--1915
reborn, rebuilt, she rose again, far vaster in expanse
a radiant city smiling from the ashes of romance
a san francisco glorified, more beauteous than of yore
enthroned upon her splendid hills, queen of the sunset shore
her flags of industry unfurled, her portals open to the world
thus, in the book of destiny, she lives for evermore
the autumn is old
the sere leaves are flying
he hath gathered up gold
and now he is dying
old age, begin sighing
the vintage is ripe
the harvest is heaping
but some that have sowed
have no riches for reaping
poor wretch, fall a-weeping
the year's in the wane
there is nothing adorning
the night has no eve
and the day has no morning
cold winter gives warning
the rivers run chill
the red sun is sinking
and i am grown old
and life is fast shrinking
here's enow for sad thinking
why, yes, dear, we can put it by. it does seem out of place
on top of these down comforts and this spread of silk and lace
you see, i'm used to having it lie so, across my feet
but maybe i won't need it here, with this nice furnace heat
i made it? yes, dear, long ago. 'twas lots of work, you think
oh, not so much. my rose quilt, now, all white and green and pink
is really handsome. this is just a plain, log cabin block
pieced out of odds and ends; but still--now that's your papa's frock
before he walked, and this bit here is his first little suit
i trimmed it up with silver braid. my, but he did look cute
that red there in the centers, was your aunt ruth's for her name
her grandmother almost clothed the child, before the others came
those plaids? the younger girls', they were. i dressed them just alike
and this was baby winnie's sack--the precious little tyke
ma wore this gown to visit me (they drove the whole way then
and little edson wore this waist. he never came again
this lavender par'matta was your great-aunt jane's--poor dear
mine was a sprig, with the lilac ground; see, in the corner here
such goods were high in war times. ah, that scrap of army blue
your bright eyes spied it! yes, dear child, that has its memories, too
they sent him home on furlough once--our soldier brother ned
but somewhere, now, the dear boy sleeps among the unknown dead
that flowered patch? well, now, to think you'd pick that from the rest
why, dearie--yes, it's satin ribbed--that's grandpa's wedding vest
just odds and ends! no great for looks. my rose quilt's nicer, far
or the one in basket pattern, or the double-pointed star
but, somehow--what! we'll leave it here? the bed won't look so neat
but i think i would sleep better with it so, across my feet
two angels, one of life and one of death
passed o'er our village as the morning broke
the dawn was on their faces, and beneath
the sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke
their attitude and aspect were the same
alike their features and their robes of white
but one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame
and one with asphodels, like flakes of light
i saw them pause on their celestial way
then said i, with deep fear and doubt oppressed
the place where thy beloved are at rest
and he who wore the crown of asphodels
descending, at my door began to knock
and my soul sank within me, as in wells
the waters sink before an earthquake's shock
i recognized the nameless agony
the terror and the tremor and the pain
that oft before had filled or haunted me
and now returned with threefold strength again
the door i opened to my heavenly guest
and listened, for i thought i heard god's voice
and, knowing whatsoe'er he sent was best
dared neither to lament nor to rejoice
then with a smile, that filled the house with light
and ere i answered, passing out of sight
on his celestial embassy he sped
the angel with the amaranthine wreath
pausing, descended, and with, voice divine
whispered a word that had a sound like death
then fell upon the house a sudden gloom
a shadow on those features fair and thin
and softly, from that hushed and darkened room
two angels issued, where but one went in
all is of god! if he but waves his hand
the mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud
till, with a smile of light on sea and land
lo! he looks back from the departing cloud
angels of life and death alike are his
without his leave they pass no threshold o'er
who, then, would wish or dare, believing this
against his messengers to shut the door
it was the pleasant harvest-time
when cellar-bins are closely stowed
and garrets bend beneath their load
and the old swallow-haunted barns
brown-gabled, long, and full of seams
through which the moted sunlight streams
and winds blow freshly in, to shake
the red plumes of the roosted cocks
and the loose hay-mow's scented locks
are filled with summer's ripened stores
its odorous grass and barley sheaves
from their low scaffolds to their eaves
on esek harden's oaken floor
with many an autumn threshing worn
lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn
and thither came young men and maids
beneath a moon that, large and low
lit that sweet eve of long ago
they took their places; some by chance
and others by a merry voice
or sweet smile guided to their choice
how pleasantly the rising moon
between the shadow of the mows
looked on them through the great elm-boughs
on sturdy boyhood, sun-embrowned
on girlhood with its solid curves
of healthful strength and painless nerves
and jests went round, and laughs that made
the house-dog answer with his howl
and kept astir the barn-yard fowl
and quaint old songs their fathers sung
in derby dales and yorkshire moors
ere norman william trod their shores
and tales, whose merry license shook
the fat sides of the saxon thane
forgetful of the hovering dane
but still the sweetest voice was mute
that river-valley ever heard
from lip of maid or throat of bird
for mabel martin sat apart
and let the hay-mow's shadow 'fall
upon the loveliest face of all
she sat apart, as one forbid
who knew that none would condescend
to own the witch-wife's child a friend
the seasons scarce had gone their round
since curious thousands thronged to see
her mother on the gallows-tree
and mocked the palsied limbs of age
that faltered on the fatal stairs
and wan lip trembling with its prayers
few questioned of the sorrowing child
or, when they saw the mother die
dreamed of the daughter's agony
they went up to their homes that day
as men and christians justified
god willed it, and the wretch had died
dear god and father of us all
forgive our faith in cruel lies
forgive the blindness that denies
forgive thy creature when he takes
for the all-perfect love thou art
some grim creation of his heart
cast down our idols, overturn
our bloody altars; let us see
thyself in thy humanity
poor mabel from her mother's grave
crept to her desolate hearth-stone
and wrestled with her fate alone
with love, and anger, and despair
the phantoms of disordered sense
the awful doubts of providence
the school-boys jeered her as they passed
and, when she sought the house of prayer
her mother's curse pursued her there
and still o'er many a neighboring door
she saw the horseshoe's curved charm
to guard against her mother's harm
that mother, poor, and sick, and lame
who daily, by the old arm-chair
folded her withered hands in prayer
who turned, in salem's dreary jail
her worn old bible o'er and o'er
when her dim eyes could read no more
sore tried and pained, the poor girl kept
her faith, and trusted that her way
so dark, would somewhere meet the day
and still her weary wheel went round
day after day, with no relief
small leisure have the poor for grief
so in the shadow mabel sits
untouched by mirth she sees and hears
her smile is sadder than her tears
but cruel eyes have found her out
and cruel lips repeat her name
and taunt her with her mother's shame
she answered not with railing words
but drew her apron o'er her face
and, sobbing, glided from the place
and only pausing at the door
her sad eyes met the troubled gaze
of one who, in her better days
had been her warm and steady friend
ere yet her mother's doom had made
even esek harden half afraid
he felt that mute appeal of tears
and, starting, with an angry frown
hushed all the wicked murmurs down
i brook no insult to my guest
but god's sweet pity ministers
unto no whiter soul than hers
let goody martin rest in peace
i never knew her harm a fly
i know who swore her life away
and, as god lives, i'd not condemn
an indian dog on word of them
poor mabel, in her lonely home
sat by the window's narrow pane
white in the moonlight's silver rain
the river, on its pebbled rim
made music such as childhood knew
the door-yard tree was whispered through
by voices such as childhood's ear
had heard in moonlights long ago
and through the willow boughs below
she saw the rippled waters shine
beyond, in waves of shade and light
the hills rolled off into the night
sweet sounds and pictures mocking so
the sadness of her human lot
she saw and heard, but heeded not
she strove to drown her sense of wrong
and, in her old and simple way
to teach, her bitter heart to pray
poor child! the prayer, began in faith
grew to a low, despairing cry
of utter misery: "let me die
oh! take me from the scornful eyes
and hide me where the cruel speech
and mocking finger may not reach
a daughter's right i dare not crave
to weep above her unblest grave
let me not live until my heart
with few to pity, and with none
to love me, hardens into stone
o god! have mercy on thy child
whose faith in thee grows weak and small
and take me ere i lose it all
the broadest lands in all the town
the skill to guide, the power to awe
were harden's; and his word was law
none dared withstand him to his face
but one sly maiden spake aside
her mother only killed a cow
or witched a churn or dairy-pan
but she, forsooth, must charm a man
a shadow on the moonlight fell
and murmuring wind and wave became
a voice whose burden was her name
had then god heard her? had he sent
his angel down? in flesh and blood
before her esek harden stood
he laid his hand upon her arm
who scoffs at you, must scoff at me
you know rough esek harden well
and if he seems no suitor gay
and if his hair is mixed with gray
the maiden grown shall never find
his heart less warm than when she smiled
upon his knees, a little child
her tears of grief were tears of joy
as folded in his strong embrace
she looked in esek harden's face
and make me worthy of my lot
he led her through his dewy fields
to where the swinging lanterns glowed
and through the doors the huskers showed
in mabel see my chosen wife
the past is past, and all offence
falls harmless from her innocence
henceforth she stands no more alone
you know what esek harden is
he brooks no wrong to him or his
now let the merriest tales be told
and let the sweetest songs be sung
that ever made the old heart young
for now the lost has found a home
and a lone hearth shall brighter burn
as all the household joys return
oh, pleasantly the harvest moon
between the shadow of the mows
looked on them through the great elm-boughs
on mabel's curls of golden hair
on esek's shaggy strength it fell
and the wind whispered, "it is well
king david's limbs were weary. he had fled
from far jerusalem; and now he stood
with his faint people for a little rest
upon the shore of jordan. the light wind
of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow
to its refreshing breath; for he had worn
the mourner's covering, and he had not felt
that he could see his people until now
they gathered round him on the fresh green bank
and spoke their kindly words, and as the sun
rose up in heaven he knelt among them there
and bowed his head upon his hands to pray
oh! when the heart is full--where bitter thoughts
come crowding thickly up for utterance
and the poor common words of courtesy
are such a mockery--how much
the bursting heart may pour itself in prayer
he prayed for israel--and his voice went up
strongly and fervently. he prayed for those
whose love had been his shield--and his deep tones
grew tremulous. but, oh! for absalom
for his estranged, misguided absalom
the proud, bright being who had burst away
in all his princely beauty to defy
the heart that cherished him--for him he prayed
in agony that would not be controll'd
strong supplication, and forgave him there
before his god for his deep sinfulness
the pall was settled. he who slept beneath
was straightened for the grave, and as the folds
sank to their still proportions, they betrayed
the matchless symmetry of absalom
the mighty joab stood beside the bier
and gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly
as if he feared the slumberer might stir
a slow step startled him. he grasped his blade
as if a trumpet rang, but the bent form
of david entered; and he gave command
in a low tone to his few followers
and left him with the dead
the king stood still
till the last echo died; then, throwing off
the sackcloth from his brow, and laying back
the pall from the still features of his child
he bowed his head upon him and broke forth
in the resistless eloquence of woe
thou who were made so beautifully fair
that death should settle in thy glorious eye
and leave his stillness in this clustering hair
how could he mark thee for the silent tomb
my proud boy, absalom
as to my bosom i have tried to press thee
how was i wont to feel my pulses thrill
like a rich harp-string yearning to caress thee
and hear thy sweet 'my father!' from those dumb
and cold lips, absalom
of music, and the voices of the young
and life will pass me in the mantling blush
and the dark tresses to the soft winds flung
but thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come
to meet me, absalom
like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken
how will its love for thee, as i depart
yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token
it were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom
to see thee, absalom
with death so like a gentle slumber on thee
and thy dark sin! oh! i could drink the cup
if from this woe its bitterness had won thee
may god have called thee, like a wanderer, home
my lost boy, absalom
he covered up his face, and bowed himself
a moment on his child; then, giving him
a look of melting tenderness, he clasped
his hands convulsively, as if in prayer
and, as if strength were given him of god
he rose up calmly, and composed the pall
firmly and decently--and left him there
as if his rest had been a breathing sleep
it is christmas day in the workhouse
and the cold bare walls are bright
with garlands of green and holly
and the place is a pleasant sight
for with clean-washed hands and faces
in a long and hungry line
the paupers sit at the tables
for this is the hour they dine
and the guardians and their ladies
although the wind is east
have come in their furs and wrappers
to watch their charges feast
to smile and be condescending
put pudding on pauper plates
to be hosts at the workhouse banquet
they've paid for--with the rates
oh, the paupers are meek and lowly
with their "thank'ee kindly, mum's
so long as they fill their stomachs
what matter whence it comes
but one of the old men mutters
and pushes his plate aside
for this is the day _she_ died
the guardians gazed in horror
the master's face went white
then the ladies clutched their husbands
thinking the man would die
struck by a bolt, or something
by the outraged one on high
but the pauper sat for a moment
then rose 'mid a silence grim
for the others had ceased to chatter
and trembled in every limb
he looked at the guardians' ladies
then, eyeing their lords, he said
whose hands are foul and red
from their dark unhallowed graves
who, torn by the hounds and mangled
declines the vulture's feast
and i won't be dragged away
just let me have the fit out
it's only on christmas day
that the black past comes to goad me
and prey on my burning brain
i'll tell you the rest in a whisper
i swear i won't shout again
hear me right out to the end
you come here to see how paupers
the season of christmas spend
you come here to watch us feeding
as they watch the captured beast
hear why a penniless pauper
spits on your palfry feast
and let you smile and think
you're doing a noble action
with the parish's meat and drink
where is my wife, you traitors
the poor old wife you slew
yes, by the god above us
my nance was killed by you
starved in a filthy den
i had never been to the parish
i came to the parish then
i swallowed my pride in coming
for, ere the ruin came
i held up my head as a trader
and i bore a spotless name
bread for a starving wife
bread for the woman who'd loved me
through fifty years of life
and what do you think they told me
mocking my awful grief
that 'the house' was open to us
but they wouldn't give 'out relief
and the bakers' shops were open
tempting a man to thieve
but i clenched my fists together
holding my head awry
so i came to her empty-handed
and mournfully told her why
she had heard of the ways of _that
for her bloodless cheeks went crimson
and up in her rags she sat
crying, 'bide the christmas here, john
we've never had one apart
i think i can bear the hunger
the other would break my heart
holding her hand in mine
praying the lord, and weeping
till my lips were salt as brine
i asked her once if she hungered
and as she answered 'no
the moon shone in at the window
set in a wreath of snow
and i saw in my darling's eyes
the far-away look of wonder
that comes when the spirit flies
and her lips were parched and parted
and her reason came and went
for she raved of our home in devon
where our happiest years were spent
came back to the tongue once more
for she talked like the country lassie
i woo'd by the devon shore
then she rose to her feet and trembled
and fell on the rags and moaned
and, 'give me a crust--i'm famished
for the love of god!' she groaned
and flew to the workhouse gate
crying 'food for a dying woman
and the answer came, 'too late
they drove me away with curses
then i fought with a dog in the street
and tore from the mongrel's clutches
a crust he was trying to eat
back, through the trampled slush
up to the crazy garret
wrapped in an awful hush
my heart sank down at the threshold
and i paused with a sudden thrill
for there in the silv'ry moonlight
my nance lay, cold and still
the sunken eyes were cast
i knew on those lips all bloodless
my name had been the last
she'd called for her absent husband
o god! had i but known
had called in vain, and in anguish
had died in that den--_alone
lay a loving woman dead
cruelly starved and murdered
for a loaf of the parish bread
at yonder gate, last christmas
i craved for a human life
you, who would feast us paupers
don't mind me in the least
think of the happy paupers
eating your christmas feast
and when you recount their blessings
in your snug, parochial way
say what you did for _me_, too
only last christmas day
first on the list is washington, virginia's proudest name
john adams next, the federalist, from massachusetts came
three sons of old virginia into the white house go
and tennessee a democrat, brave jackson staunch and true
martin van buren of new york, and harrison we see
and tyler of virginia, and polk of tennessee
louisiana taylor sent; new york millard fillmore
new hampshire gave us franklin pierce; when his term was o'er
the keystone state buchanan sent.  war thunders shook the realm
abe lincoln wore a martyr's crown, and johnson took the helm
then u.s. grant of illinois who ruled with sword and pen
and hayes, and garfield who was shot, two noble buckeye men
chester arthur from new york, and grover cleveland came
ben harrison served just four years, then cleveland ruled again
mckinley--shot at buffalo--the nation plunged in grief
and "teddy" roosevelt of new york served seven years as chief
taft of ohio followed him. then woodrow wilson came
new jersey's learned democrat; war set the world aflame
and when the tide of strife and hate its baneful course had run
the country went republican and warren harding won
no duty would he shirk,--he died while on a western trip
coolidge of massachusetts then assumed the leadership
and annie and willie had crept into bed
there were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes
and each little bosom was heaving with sighs
for to-night their stern father's command had been given
that they should retire precisely at seven
instead of at eight; for they troubled him more
with questions unheard of than ever before
he had told them he thought this delusion a sin
no such being as santa claus ever had been
and he hoped, after this, he should never more hear
how he scrambled down chimneys with presents, each year
and this was the reason that two little heads
so restlessly tossed on their soft downy beds
eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten
not a word had been spoken by either till then
when willie's sad face from the blanket did peep
and whispered, "dear annie, is oo fast asleep
for somehow, it makes me so sorry because
dear papa has said there is no santa claus
now we know there is, and it can't be denied
for he came every year before mamma died
but then i've been thinking that she used to pray
and god would hear everything mamma would say
and perhaps she asked him to send santa claus here
with the sacks full of presents he brought every year
and ask him to send him with presents aden
four little bare feet bounded out on the floor
and four little knees the soft carpet pressed
and two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast
that the presents we ask for we're sure to receive
you must wait just as still till i say the 'amen
and by that you will know that your turn has come then
dear jesus, look down on my brother and me
and grant as the favor we are asking of thee
i want a wax dolly, a tea-set and ring
and an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring
bless papa, dear jesus, and cause him to see
that santa claus loves us far better than he
don't let him get fretful and angry again
at dear brother willie, and annie, amen
and bing us some pesents before it is 'ight
i want he should div me a nice ittle sed
with bight, shiny unners, and all painted yed
a box full of tandy, a book and a toy
amen--and then desus, i'll be a dood boy
their prayers being ended they raised up their heads
and with hearts light and cheerful again sought their beds
they were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep
and with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep
eight, nine, and the little french clock had struck ten
ere the father had thought of his children again
he seems now to hear annie's half suppressed sighs
and to see the big tears stand in willie's blue eyes
but then i was troubled,--my feelings found vent
for bank-stock to-day has gone down ten per cent
but of course they've forgotten their troubles ere this
and that i denied them the thrice asked-for kiss
but just to make sure i'll steal up to their door
for i never spoke harsh to my darlings before
so saying, he softly ascended the stairs
and arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers
his annie's "bless papa" draws forth the big tears
and willie's grave promise falls sweet on his ears
i'll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said
then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down
threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown
donned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street
a millionaire facing the cold driving sleet
nor stopped he until he had bought everything
from the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring
indeed he kept adding so much to his store
that the various presents outnumbered a score
then homeward he turned with his holiday load
and with aunt mary's aid in the nursery 'twas stowed
miss dolly was seated beneath a pine-tree
by the side of a table spread out for a tea
a work-box well filled in the centre was laid
and on it the ring for which annie had prayed
a soldier in uniform stood by a sled
with bright shining runners, and all painted red
there were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to see
and birds of all colors--were perched in the tree
while santa claus, laughing, stood up in the top
as if getting ready more presents to drop
and as the fond father the picture surveyed
he thought for his trouble he had amply been paid
and he said to himself as he brushed off a tear
i've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before
what care i if bank-stocks fall ten per cent more
hereafter i'll make it a rule, i believe
to have santa claus visit us each christmas eve
so thinking he gently extinguished the light
and tripped down the stairs to retire for the night
as soon as the beams of the bright morning sun
put the darkness to flight, and the stars, one by one
four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide
and at the same moment the presents espied
then out of their beds they sprang with a bound
and the very gifts prayed for were all of them found
they laughed and they cried in their innocent glee
and shouted for papa to come quick and see
what presents old santa claus brought in the night
while dear little willie climbed up on his knee
determined no secret between them should be
and told in soft whispers how annie had said
that their blessed mamma, so long ago dead
used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair
and that god, up in heaven, had answered her prayer
and dod answered our payers; now wasn't he dood
and knew just what presents my children would please
well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf
blind father! who caused your proud heart to relent
and the hasty word spoken so soon to repent
and made you his agent to answer their prayers
i wandered lonely where the pine-trees made
against the bitter east their barricade
and, guided by its sweet
perfume, i found, within a narrow dell
the trailing spring flower tinted like a shell
amid dry leaves and mosses at my feet
from under dead boughs, for whose loss the pines
moaned ceaseless overhead, the blossoming vines
lifted their glad surprise
while yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless trees
his feathers ruffled by the chill sea-breeze
and snow-drifts lingered under april skies
as, pausing, o'er the lonely flower i bent
i thought of lives thus lowly clogged and pent
which yet find room
through care and cumber, coldness and decay
to lend a sweetness to the ungenial day
and make the sad earth happier for their bloom
tho' yer lamp o' life is burnin' with a clear and steady light
an' it never seems ter flicker, but it's allers shinin' bright
tho' it sheds its rays unbroken for a thousand happy days
father time is ever turnin' down the wick that feeds yer blaze
so it clearly is yer duty ef you've got a thing to do
ter put yer shoulder to ther wheel an' try to push her through
ef yer upon a wayward track you better turn about
you've lost ther chance to do it
when the
light
speak kindly to the woman who is working fer yer praise
ther same way as you used ter in those happy courtin' days
she likes appreciation just the same ez me an' you
and it's only right and proper that yer give her what is due
don't wait until her lamp o' life is burnin' dim an' low
afore you tell her what you orter told her long ago
now's ther time ter cheer her up an' put her blues to rout
you've lost ther chance to do it
when the
light
don't keep a-puttin' matters off an' settin' dates ahead
to-morrow's sun'll find a hundred thousand of us dead
don't think because yer feelin well you won't be sick no more
sometimes the reddest pippin has a  worm-hole to the core
don't let a killin' habit grow upon you soft and still
because you think thet you ken throw  it from you at your will
now's ther time ter quit it when yer feelin' brave an' stout
you've lost ther chance to do it
when the
light
i'd rather die with nothin' then ter hev ther people say
that i had got my money in a robbin', graspin' way
no words above my restin' place from any tongue or pen
would hev a deeper meanin' than "he helped his fellow-men
so ef you hev a fortune and you want to help the poor
don't keep a-stavin' off until yon get a little more
ef yer upon a miser's track you better turn about
yer record keeps on burnin
when the
light
an old lady sat in her old arm-chair
with wrinkled visage and disheveled hair
and pale and hunger-worn features
for days and for weeks her only fare
as she sat there in her old arm-chair
had been potatoes
but now they were gone; of bad or good
not one was left for the old lady's food
of those potatoes
and she sighed and said, "what shall i do
where shall i send, and to whom shall i go
for more potatoes
and she thought of the deacon over the way
the deacon so ready to worship and pray
whose cellar was full of potatoes
and she said: "i will send for the deacon to come
he'll not mind much to give me some
of such a store of potatoes
and the deacon came over as fast as he could
thinking to do the old lady some good
but never thought of potatoes
he asked her at once what was her chief want
and she, simple soul, expecting a grant
immediately answered, "potatoes
but the deacon's religion didn't lie that way
he was more accustomed to preach and pray
than to give of his hoarded potatoes
so, not hearing, of course, what the old lady said
he rose to pray with uncovered head
but _she_ only thought of potatoes
he prayed for patience, and wisdom, and grace
but when he prayed, "lord, give her peace
she audibly sighed "give potatoes
and at the end of each prayer which he said
he heard, or thought that he heard in its stead
the same request for potatoes
the deacon was troubled; knew not what to do
about "those carnal potatoes
so, ending his prayer, he started for home
as the door closed behind him, he heard a deep groan
and that groan followed him all the way home
in the midst of the night it haunted his room
he could bear it no longer; arose and dressed
from his well-filled cellar taking in haste
a bag of his best potatoes
again he went to the widow's lone hut
her sleepless eyes she had not shut
but there she sat in that old arm-chair
with the same wan features, the same sad air
and, entering in, he poured on the floor
a bushel or more from his goodly store
of choicest potatoes
the widow's cup was running o'er
her face was haggard and wan no more
and he kneeled him down on the sanded floor
where he had poured his goodly store
and such a prayer the deacon prayed
as never before his lips essayed
no longer embarrassed, but free and full
he poured out the voice of a liberal soul
and the widow responded aloud "amen
but spake no more of potatoes
and would you, who hear this simple tale
pray for the poor, and praying, "prevail
then preface your prayers with alms and good deeds
search out the poor, their wants and their needs
pray for peace, and grace, and spiritual food
for wisdom and guidance,-for all these are good
three little words you often see
are articles _a_, _an_, and _the
a noun's the name of anything
as _house_ or _garden_, _hoop_ or _swing
instead of nouns the pronouns stand
adjectives tell the kind of noun
as _great_, _small_, _pretty_, _white_ or _brown
verbs tell something to be done
to _read_, _count_, _sing_, _laugh_ or _run
how things are done the adverbs tell
as _slowly_, _quickly_, _ill_ or _well
conjunctions join the words together
as men _and_ women, wind _or_ weather
the preposition stands before
a noun, as _in_ or _through_ a door
the interjection shows surprise
as _oh!_ how pretty, _ah!_ how wise
the whole are called nine parts of speech
which reading, writing, speaking teach
he came to my desk with, quivering lip
the lesson was done
i took the old leaf, stained and blotted
and gave him a new one all unspotted
and into his sad eyes smiled
i went to the throne with a quivering soul
the old year was done
i have spoiled this one
he took the old leaf, stained and blotted
and gave me a new one all unspotted
and into my sad heart smiled
how are you hoeing your row, my boy
say, how are you hoeing your row
do you hoe it fair
do you hoe it square
do you hoe it the best that you know
do you cut out the weeds as you ought to do
do you plant what is beautiful there
for the harvest, you know
will be just what you sow
are you working it on the square
say, are you killing the weeds, my boy
are you hoeing your row neat and clean
are you going straight
at a hustling gait
are you cutting out all that is mean
do you whistle and sing as you toil along
are you finding your work a delight
if you do it this way
you will gladden the day
and your row will be tended right
hoeing your row with a will, my boy
and giving it thought and care
will insure success
and your efforts bless
as the crop to the garner you bear
for the world will look on as you hoe your row
and will judge you by that which you do
therefore, try for first prize
though your utmost it tries
for the harvest depends on you
fling it from mast and steeple
symbol o'er land and sea
of the life of a happy people
gallant and strong and free
proudly we view its colors
flag of the brave and true
with the clustered stars and the steadfast bars
the red, the white, and the blue
flag of the fearless-hearted
flag of the broken chain
flag in a day-dawn started
never to pale or wane
dearly we prize its colors
with the heaven light breaking through
the clustered stars and the steadfast bars
the red, the white, and the blue
flag of the sturdy fathers
flag of the loyal sons
beneath its folds it gathers
earth's best and noblest ones
boldly we wave its colors
our veins are thrilled anew
by the steadfast bars, the clustered stars
the red, the white, and the blue
hey! little evergreens
sturdy and strong
summer and autumn-time
hasten along
harvest the sunbeams, then
bind them in sheaves
range them and change them
to tufts of green leaves
delve in the mellow-mold
far, far below
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow
up, up so airily
to the blue sky
lift up your leafy tips
stately and high
clasp tight your tiny cones
tawny and brown
by and by buffeting
rains will pelt down
by and by bitterly
chill winds will blow
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow
gather all uttermost
beauty, because
hark, till i tell it now
how santa claus
out of the northern land
over the seas
soon shall come seeking you
evergreen trees
seek you with reindeer soon
over the snow
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow
what if the maple flare
flaunting and red
you shall wear waxen white
taper instead
what if now, otherwhere
birds are beguiled
you shall yet nestle
the little christ-child
ah! the strange splendor
the fir-trees shall know
and so
little evergreens, grow
grow! grow
grow, little evergreens, grow
the sun's heat will give out in ten million years more
and he worried about it
it will sure give out then, if it doesn't before
and he worried about it
it will surely give out, so the scientists said
in all scientifical books he had read
and the whole boundless universe then will be dead
and he worried about it
and some day the earth will fall into the sun
and he worried about it
just as sure and as straight as if shot from a gun
and he worried about it
when strong gravitation unbuckles her straps
it will come in a few million ages, perhaps
and he worried about it
and the earth will become much too small for the race
and he worried about it
when we'll pay thirty dollars an inch for pure space
and he worried about it
the earth will be crowded so much, without doubt
that there won't be room for one's tongue to stick out
nor room for one's thought to wander about
and he worried about it
and the gulf stream will curve, and new england grow torrider
and he worried about it
than was ever the climate of southernmost florida
and he worried about it
our ice crop will be knocked into small smithereens
and crocodiles block up our mowing-machines
and we'll lose our fine crops of potatoes and beans
and he worried about it
and in less than ten thousand years, there's no doubt
and he worried about it
our supply of lumber and coal will give out
and he worried about it
just then the ice-age will return cold and raw
frozen men will stand stiff with arms outstretched in awe
as if vainly beseeching a general thaw
and he worried about it
his wife took in washing--half a dollar a day
he didn't worry about it
his daughter sewed shirts the rude grocer to pay
he didn't worry about it
while his wife beat her tireless rub-a-dub-dub
on the washboard drum of her old wooden tub
he sat by the stoves and he just let her rub
he didn't worry about it
no gilt or tinsel taints the dress
of him who holds the natal power
no weighty helmet's fastenings press
on brow that shares columbia's dower
no blaring trumpets mark the step
of him with mind on peace intent
and so--hats off! here comes the state
a modest king
no cavalcade with galloping squads
surrounds this man, whose mind controls
the actions of the million minds
whose hearts the starry banner folds
instead, in simple garb he rides
the king to whom grim fate has lent
her dower of righteousness and faith
to guide his will
the ancient lands are struck with awe
here stands a power at which they  scoffed
kings, rulers, scribes of pristine states
are dazed,--at columbia they mocked
yet human wills have forged new states
their wills on justice full intent
and fashioned here a lowly king
the people's choice
war-ravaged, spent, and torn--old worlds
with hatred rent, turn to the west
on every side our kingdom's pressed
and see! columbia hastens forth
her healing hand to peace is lent
her sword unsheathed has forged the calm
her sons sent by
full many a storm has tossed the barque
since first it had its maiden trip
full many a conflagration's spark
has scorched and seared the laboring ship
and yet it ploughs a straightway course
through wrack of billows; wind-tossed, spent
on sails the troubled ship of state
steered forward by
stand up! hats off! he's coming by
no roll of drums peals at his course
now give a cheer! he's part of you
your will with his: the nation's force
and--as he passes--breathe a prayer
may justice to his mind be lent
and may the grace of heaven be with
the man who rules
sleepy little, creepy little goblins in the gloaming
with their airy little, fairy little faces all aglow
winking little, blinking little brownies gone a-roaming
hear the rustling little, bustling little footfalls as they go
laughing little, chaffing little voices sweetly singing
in the dearest little, queerest little baby lullabies
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes
cricket in the thicket with the oddest little clatter
sings his rattling little, prattling little, tattling little tune
fleet the feet of tiny stars go patter, patter, patter
as they scamper from the heavens at the rising of the moon
beaming little, gleaming little fireflies go dreaming
to the dearest little, queerest little baby lullabies
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes
quaking little, shaking little voices all a-quiver
in the mushy little, rushy little, weedy, reedy bogs
droning little, moaning little chorus by the river
in the croaking little, joking little cadence of the frogs
eerie little, cheery little glowworms in the gloaming
where the clover heads like fairy little nightcaps rise
creep! creep! creep
time to go to sleep
baby playing 'possum with his big brown eyes
if we should be shipwrecked together
and only had water for one
and it was the hottest of weather
right out in the boiling sun
he'd tell me--no matter how bad he
might want it--to take a drink first
and then he would smile--oh, so glad he
had saved me!--and perish from thirst
or, if we were lost on the prairie
and only had food for a day
he'd come and would give me the share he
had wrapped up and hidden away
and after i ate it with sadness
he'd smile with his very last breath
and lay himself down full of gladness
to save me--and starve right to death
and if i was wounded in battle
and out where great danger might be
he'd come through the roar and the rattle
of guns and of bullets to me
he'd carry me out, full of glory
no matter what trouble he had
and then he would fall down, all gory
with wounds, and would die--but be glad
we're chums--that's the reason he'd do it
and that's what a chum ought to be
and if it was fire he'd go through it
if i should call him to me
you see other fellows may know you
and friends that you have go and come
but a boy has one boy he can go to
for help all the time--that's his chum
jim brady's big brother's a wonderful lad
and wonderful, wonderful muscles he had
he swung by one arm from the limb of a tree
and hung there while jim counted up forty-three
just as slow as he could; and he leaped at a bound
across a wide creek and lit square on the ground
just as light as a deer; and the things he can do
so jimmy told us, you would hardly think true
jim brady's big brother could throw a fly ball
from center to home just like nothing at all
and often while playing a game he would stand
and take a high fly with just only one hand
jim brady showed us where he knocked a home run
and won the big game when it stood three to one
against the home team, and jim brady, he showed
the place where it lit in the old wagon road
jim brady's big brother could bat up a fly
that you hardly could see, for it went up so high
he'd bring up his muscle and break any string
that you tied on his arm like it wasn't a thing
he used to turn handsprings, and cartwheels, and he
could jump through his hands just as slick as could be
and circuses often would want him to go
and be in the ring, but his mother said no
jim brady's big brother would often make bets
with boys that he'd turn two complete summersets
from off of the spring-board before he would dive
and you'd hardly think he would come up alive
and nobody else who went there to swim
could do it, but it was just easy for him
and they'd all be scared, so jim said, when he'd stay
in under and come up a half mile away
jim brady's big brother, so jim said, could run
five miles in a race just as easy as one
right often he walked on his hands half a block
and could have walked more if he'd wanted to walk
and jimmy says wait till he comes home from school
where he is gone now, and some day, when it's cool
he'll get him to prove everything to be true
that jimmy told us his big brother could do
is my little lad, my elihu
a-sailing with your ship
the sailor's eyes were dim with dew
he said with trembling lip
another such a one as he
what little lad, do you say
why, elihu, that took to the sea
the moment i put him off my knee
it was just the other day
the _gray swan_ sailed away
stood open with a great surprise
his heart began in his throat to rise
the jacket he had on
with her anchor clutching hold of the sand
for a month, and never stir
like a lover kissing his lady's hand
the wild sea kissing her
a sight to remember, sir
all this was twenty years ago
i stood on the _gray swan's_ deck
and to that lad i saw you throw
taking it off, as it might be, so
the kerchief from your neck
that has made you sick and made you sad
sail with the _gray swan's_ crew
the best boy ever mother had
be sure he sailed with the crew
what would you have him do
nor sent you word, nor made you sign
to say he was alive
besides, he may be in the brine
and could he write from the grave
tut, man, what would you have
but if the lad still live
and come back home, think you you can
forgive him?"--"miserable man
you're mad as the sea,--you rave
what have i to forgive
the sailor twitched his shirt so blue
and from within his bosom drew
the kerchief. she was wild
my little lad, my elihu
my blessed boy, my child
my dead,--my living child
the joys of living wreathe my face
my heart keeps time to freshet's race
of balmy airs i drink my fill
why, there's a yellow daffodil
along the stream a soft green tinge
gives hint of feathery willow fringe
methinks i heard a robin's "cheer
i'm glad spring's here
an afternoon of buzzing flies
heat waves that sear, and quivering rise
the long white road, the plodding team
the deep, cool grass in which to dream
the distant cawing of the crows
tall, waving grain, long orchard rows
the peaceful cattle in the stream
midsummer's dream
a cold, gray day, a lowering sky
a lonesome pigeon wheeling by
the soft, blue smoke that hangs and fades
the shivering crane that flaps and wades
dead leaves that, whispering, quit their tree
the peace the river sings to me
the chill aloofness of the fall
i love it all
a sheet of ice, the ring of steel
the crunch of snow beneath the heel
loud, jingling bells, the straw-lined sleigh
a restless pair that prance and neigh
the early coming of the night
red glowing logs, a shaded light
the firelit realm of books is mine
oh, winter's fine
hamelin town's in brunswick
by famous hanover city
the river weser, deep and wide
washes its wall on the southern side
a pleasanter spot you never spied
but, when begins my ditty
almost five hundred years ago
to see the townsfolk suffer so
from vermin, was a pity
they fought the dogs and killed the cats
and bit the babies in the cradles
and ate the cheeses out of the vats
and licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles
split open the kegs of salted sprats
made nests inside men's sunday hats
and even spoiled the women's chats
by drowning their speaking
with shrieking and squeaking
in fifty different sharps and flats
at last the people in a body
to the town hall came flocking
and as for our corporation--shocking
to think we buy gowns lined with ermine
for dolts that can't or won't determine
what's best to rid us of our vermin
you hope, because you're old and obese
to find in the furry civic robe ease
rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking
to find the remedy we're lacking
or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing
at this the mayor and corporation
quaked with a mighty consternation
an hour they sat in council
at length the mayor broke silence
i wish i were a mile hence
it's easy to bid one rack one's brain
i'm sure my poor head aches again
i've scratched it so, and all in vain
oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap
just as he said this, what should hap
at the chamber-door but a gentle tap
looking little though wondrous fat
nor brighter was his eye, nor moister
than a too-long-opened oyster
save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous
for a plate of turtle green and glutinous
anything like the sound of a rat
makes my heart go pit-a-pat
and in did come the strangest figure
his queer long coat from heel to head
was half of yellow and half of red
and he himself was tall and thin
with sharp blue eyes, each like a pin
and light loose hair, yet swarthy skin
no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin
but lips where smiles went out and in
there was no guessing his kith and kin
and nobody could enough admire
the tall man and his quaint attire
quoth one: "it's as my great-grandsire
starting up at the trump of doom's tone
had walked this way from his painted tombstone
he advanced to the council-table
and, "please your honours," said he, "i'm able
by means of a secret charm, to draw
all creatures living beneath the sun
that creep or swim or fly or run
after me so as you never saw
and i chiefly use my charm
on creatures that do people harm
the mole and toad and newt and viper
and people call me the pied piper
a scarf of red and yellow stripe
to match with his coat of the self-same cheque
and at the scarf's end hung a pipe
and his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying
as if impatient to be playing
upon this pipe, as low it dangled
over his vesture so old-fangled
in tartary i freed the cham
last june, from his huge swarms of gnats
i eased in asia the nizam
of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats
and as for what your brain bewilders
if i can rid your town of rats
will you give me a thousand guilders
of the astonished mayor and corporation
into the street the piper stept
smiling first a little smile
as if he knew what magic slept
in his quiet pipe the while
then, like a musical adept
to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled
and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled
like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled
and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered
you heard as if an army muttered
and the muttering grew to a grumbling
and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling
and out of the houses the rats came tumbling
great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats
brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats
grave old plodders, gay young friskers
fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins
cocking tails and pricking whiskers
families by tens and dozens
brothers, sisters, husbands, wives
followed the piper for their lives
from street to street he piped advancing
and step for step they followed dancing
until they came to the river weser
wherein all plunged and perished
swam across and lived to carry
to rat-land home his commentary
which was, "at the first shrill notes of the pipe
i heard a sound as of scraping tripe
and putting apples, wondrous ripe
into a cider-press's gripe
and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards
and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards
and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks
and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks
and it seemed as if a voice
is breathed) called out, 'oh, rats, rejoice
the world is grown to one vast drysaltery
so munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon
breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon
and just as a bulky sugar-puncheon
all ready staved, like a great sun shone
glorious scarce an inch before me
just as methought it said, 'come, bore me
you should have heard the hamelin people
ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple
poke out the nests and block up the holes
consult with carpenters and builders
and leave in our town not even a trace
of the rats!"--when suddenly, up the face
of the piper perked in the market-place
with a, "first, if you please, my thousand guilders
a thousand guilders! the mayor looked blue
so did the corporation, too
for council dinners made rare havoc
with claret, moselle, vin-de-grave, hock
and half the money would replenish
their cellar's biggest butt with rhenish
to pay this sum to a wandering fellow
with a gypsy coat of red and yellow
we saw with our eyes the vermin sink
and what's dead can't come to life, i think
so, friend, we're not the folks to shrink
from the duty of giving you something for drink
and a matter of money to put in your poke
but as for the guilders, what we spoke
of them, as you very well know, was in joke
beside, our losses have made us thrifty
a thousand guilders! come, take fifty
the piper's face fell, and he cried
i've promised to visit by dinner-time
bagdat, and accept the prime
of the head-cook's pottage, all he's rich in
for having left, in the caliph's kitchen
of a nest of scorpions no survivor
with him i proved no bargain-driver
with you, don't think i'll bate a stiver
and folks who put me in a passion
may find me pipe after another fashion
being worse treated than a cook
insulted by a lazy ribald
with idle pipe and vesture piebald
you threaten us, fellow? do your worst
blow your pipe there till you burst
once more he stept into the street
and to his lips again
laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane
and ere he blew three notes (such sweet
soft notes as yet musician's cunning
never gave the enraptured air
there was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling
small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering
little hands clapping and little tongues chattering
and, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering
out came the children running
all the little boys and girls
with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls
and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls
tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
the wonderful music with shouting and laughter
the mayor was dumb, and the council stood
as if they were changed into blocks of wood
unable to move a step, or cry
to the children merrily skipping by
that joyous crowd at the piper's back
but how the mayor was on the rack
and the wretched council's bosoms beat
as the piper turned from the high street
to where the weser rolled its waters
right in the way of their sons and daughters
however, he turned from south to west
and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed
and after him the children pressed
great was the joy in every breast
he's forced to let the piping drop
and we shall see our children stop
when, lo, as they reached the mountainside
a wondrous portal opened wide
as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed
and the piper advanced and the children followed
and when all were in to the very last
the door in the mountainside shut fast
did i say, all? no! one was lame
and could not dance the whole of the way
and in after years, if you would blame
his sadness, he was used to say
i can't forget that i'm bereft
of all the pleasant sights they see
which the piper also promised me
for he led us, he said, to a joyous land
joining the town and just at hand
where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew
and flowers put forth a fairer hue
and everything was strange and new
the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here
and their dogs outran our fallow deer
and honey-bees had lost their stings
and horses were born with eagles' wings
and just as i became assured
my lame foot would be speedily cured
the music stopped and i stood still
and found myself outside the hill
left alone against my will
to go now limping as before
and never hear of that country more
alas, alas for hamelin
there came into many a burgher's pate
a text which says that heaven's gate
opes to the rich at as easy rate
as the needle's eye takes a camel in
the mayor sent east, west, north, and south
to offer the piper, by word of mouth
wherever it was men's lot to find him
silver and gold to his heart's content
if he'd only return the way he went
and bring the children behind him
but when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour
and piper and dancers were gone for ever
they made a decree that lawyers never
should think their records dated duly
if, after the day of the month and year
these words did not as well appear
on the twenty-second of july
thirteen hundred and seventy-six
and the better in memory to fix
the place of the children's last retreat
they called it, the pied piper's street
where any one playing on pipe or tabour
was sure for the future to lose his labour
nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
to shock with mirth a street so solemn
but opposite the place of the cavern
they wrote the story on a column
and on the great church-window painted
the same, to make the world acquainted
how their children were stolen away
and there it stands to this very day
and i must not omit to say
that in transylvania there's a tribe
of alien people who ascribe
the outlandish ways and dress
on which their neighbours lay such stress
to their fathers and mothers having risen
out of some subterraneous prison
into which they were trepanned
long time ago in a mighty band
out of hamelin town in brunswick land
but how or why, they don't understand
so, willy, let me and you be wipers
of scores out with all men--especially pipers
and, whether they pipe us free fróm rats or fróm mice
if we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise
on the sea and at the hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two
did the english fight the french,--woe to france
and, the thirty-first of may, helter-skelter through the blue
like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
came crowding ship on ship to saint malo on the rance
with the english fleet in view
first and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, damfreville
close on him fled, great and small
twenty-two good ships in all
and they signalled to the place
get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick--or, quicker still
here's the english can and will
then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board
laughed they
and scored
shall the _formidable_ here with her twelve and eighty guns
think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way
trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons
and with flow at full beside
now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide
reach the mooring? rather say
while rock stands or water runs
not a ship will leave the bay
then was called a council straight
brief and bitter the debate
all that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow
for a prize to plymouth sound
better run the ships aground
let the captains all and each
shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach
france must undergo her fate
was ever spoke or heard
for up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
no such man of mark, and meet
with his betters to compete
but a simple breton sailor pressed by tourville for the fleet
a poor coasting-pilot he, hervé riel the croisickese
and "what mockery or malice have we here?" cries hervé riel
talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
on my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
are you bought by english gold? is it love the lying's for
morn and eve, night and day
have i piloted your bay
entered free and anchored fast at the foot of solidor
burn the fleet and ruin france? that were worse than fifty hogues
sirs, they know i speak the truth! sirs, believe me there's a way
only let me lead the line
have the biggest ship to steer
get this _formidable_ clear
make the others follow mine
and i lead them, most and least, by a passage i know well
right to solidor past grève
and there lay them safe and sound
and if one ship misbehave
why, i've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries hervé riel
not a minute more to wait
take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief
captains, give the sailor place
he is admiral, in brief
still the north wind, by god's grace
see the noble fellow's face
as the big ship, with a bound
clears the entry like a hound
keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound
see, safe through shoal and rock
how they follow in a flock
not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground
not a spar that comes to grief
the peril, see, is past
all are harboured to the last
and just as hervé riel hollas "anchor!"--sure as fate
up the english come--too late
so, the storm subsides to calm
they see the green trees wave
on the heights o'erlooking grève
hearts that bled are stanched with balm
let the english rake the bay
gnash their teeth and glare askance
as they cannonade away
how hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance
out burst all with one accord
let france, let france's king
thank the man that did the thing
what a shout, and all one word
as he stepped in front once more
not a symptom of surprise
in the frank blue breton eyes
just the same man as before
then said damfreville, "my friend
i must speak out at the end
though i find the speaking hard
praise is deeper than the lips
you have saved the king his ships
you must name your own reward
demand whate'er you will
france remains your debtor still
ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not damfreville
then a beam of fun outbroke
on the bearded mouth that spoke
as the honest heart laughed through
those frank eyes of breton blue
since on board the duty's done
and from malo roads to croisic point, what is it but a run
since 'tis ask and have, i may
since the others go ashore
come! a good whole holiday
leave to go and see my wife, whom i call the belle aurore
that he asked and that he got,--nothing more
name and deed alike are lost
not a pillar nor a post
in his croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell
not a head in white and black
on a single fishing-smack
in memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
all that france saved from the fight whence england bore the bell
go to paris: rank on rank
search the heroes flung pell-mell
on the louvre, face and flank
you shall look long enough ere you come to hervé riel
so, for better and for worse
hervé riel, accept my verse
in my verse, hervé riel, do thou once more
save the squadron, honour france, love thy wife the belle aurore

i sprang to the stirrup, and joris, and he
i galloped, dirck galloped, we galloped all three
behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest
and into the midnight we galloped abreast
not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place
i turned in my saddle and made its girths tight
then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right

nor galloped less steadily roland a whit

at boom, a great yellow star came out to see
at düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be
and from mecheln church-steeple we heard the half chime
so joris broke silence with, "yet there is time
at aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun
and against him the cattle stood black every one
to stare through the mist at us galloping past
and i saw my stout galloper roland at last
with resolute shoulders, each butting away
the haze, as some bluff river headland its spray
and his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
for my voice, and the other pricked out on his track
and one eye's black intelligence,--ever that glance
o'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance
and the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
his fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on
by hasselt, dirck groaned; and cried joris, "stay spur
your roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her
we'll remember at aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze
of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees
and sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank
as down on her haunches she shuddered and sank
past looz and past tongres, no cloud in the sky
the broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh
till over by dalhem a dome-spire sprang white
and "gallop," gasped joris, "for aix is in sight
rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone
and there was my roland to hear the whole weight
of the news which alone could save aix from her fate
with his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim
and with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim
then i cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall
shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all
stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear
called my roland his pet-name, my horse without peer
clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good
till at length into aix roland galloped and stood
and all i remember is--friends flocking round
as i sat with his head, 'twixt my knees on the ground
and no voice but was praising this roland of mine
as i poured down his throat our last measure of wine
which (the burgesses voted by common consent

you know, we french stormed ratisbon
a mile or so away
on a little mound, napoleon
stood on our storming-day
with neck out-thrust, you fancy how
legs wide, arms locked behind
as if to balance the prone brow
oppressive with its mind
just as perhaps he mused "my plans
that soar, to earth may fall
let once my army-leader, lannes
waver at yonder wall
out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
a rider, bound on bound
full-galloping; nor bridle drew
until he reached the mound
then off there flung in smiling joy
and held himself erect
by just his horse's mane, a boy
you hardly could suspect
scarce any blood came through
you looked twice ere you saw his breast
was all but shot in two
we've got you ratisbon

and you'll be there anon
to see your flag-bird flap his vans

soared up again like fire
the chief's eye flashed; but presently
softened itself, as sheathes
a film the mother-eagle's eye
when her bruised eaglet breathes

the headstall away from the wrist he leaves thrice bound as before
he springs on the pearl, is launched on the desert like bolt from bow
up starts our plundered man: from his breast though the heart be
ripped
yet his mind has the mastery: behold, in a minute more
he is out and off and away on buhéyseh, whose worth we know
and hóseyn--his blood turns flame, he has learned long since to ride
and buhéyseh does her part,--they gain--they are gaining fast
on the fugitive pair, and duhl has ed-dárraj to cross and quit
and to reach the ridge el-sabán,--no safety till that he spied
and buhéyseh is, bound by bound, but a horse-length off at last
for the pearl has missed the tap of the heel, the touch of the bit
she shortens her stride, she chafes at her rider the strange and
queer
buhéyseh is mad with hope--beat sister she shall and must
though duhl, of the hand and heel so clumsy, she has to thank
she is near now, nose by tail--they are neck by croup--joy! fear
what folly makes hóseyn shout "dog duhl, damned son of the dust
touch the right ear and press with your foot my pearl's left flank
and duhl was wise at the word, and muléykeh as prompt perceived
who was urging redoubled pace, and to hear him was to obey
and a leap indeed gave she, and evanished for evermore
and hóseyn looked one long last look as who, all bereaved
looks, fain to follow the dead so far as the living may
then he turned buhéyseh's neck slow homeward, weeping sore
and, lo, in the sunrise, still sat hóseyn upon the ground
weeping: and neighbours came, the tribesmen of bénu-asád
in the vale of green er-rass, and they questioned him of his grief
and he told from first to last how, serpent-like, duhl had wound
his way to the nest, and how duhl rode like an ape, so bad
and how buhéyseh did wonders, yet pearl remained with the thief
and they jeered him, one and all: "poor hóseyn is crazed past hope
how else had he wrought himself his ruin, in fortune's spite
to have simply held the tongue were a task for boy or girl
and here were muléykeh again, the eyed like an antelope
the child of his heart by day, the wife of his breast by night
my pearl
sing me a hero! quench my thirst
of soul, ye bards
quoth bard the first
his helm and eke his habergeon
sir olaf and his bard
my hero to some steep, beneath
which precipice smiled tempting death
you too without your host have reckoned
sang to herself at careless play
and fell into the stream. 'dismay
help, you the standers-by!' none stirred
and children ere they risk their lives
over the balustrade has bounced
a mere instinctive dog, and pounced
plumb on the prize. 'how well he dives
in mouth, alive too, clutched from quite
a depth of ten feet--twelve, i bet
good dog! what, off again? there's yet
another child to save? all right
it's instinct in the animal
good dog! but he's a long while under
if he got drowned i should not wonder
strong current, that against the wall
now, did you ever? reason reigns
in man alone, since all tray's pains
have fished--the child's doll from the slime
trotted my hero off,--old tray
till somebody, prerogatived
with reason, reasoned: 'why he dived
his brain would show us, i should say
purchase--that animal for me
by vivisection, at expense
of half-an-hour and eighteenpence
how brain secretes dog's soul, we'll see
what a pretty tale you told me
once upon a time
was it prose or was it rhyme
greek or latin? greek, you said
while your shoulder propped my head
anyhow there's no forgetting
this much if no more
that a poet (pray, no petting
yes, a bard, sir, famed of yore
went where suchlike used to go
singing for a prize, you know
well, he had to sing, nor merely
sing but play the lyre
playing was important clearly
quite as singing: i desire
sir, you keep the fact in mind
for a purpose that's behind
there stood he, while deep attention
held the judges round
to detect the slightest sound
sung or played amiss: such ears
had old judges, it appears
none the less he sang out boldly
played in time and tune
till the judges, weighing coldly
each note's worth, seemed, late or soon
sure to smile "in vain one tries
picking faults out: take the prize
when, a mischief! were they seven
strings the lyre possessed
oh, and afterwards eleven
thank you! well, sir,--who had guessed
such ill luck in store?--it happed
one of those same seven strings snapped
all was lost, then! no! a cricket
for mere love of music--flew
with its little heart on fire
lighted on the crippled lyre
so that when (ah, joy!) our singer
for his truant string
feels with disconcerted finger
what does cricket else but fling
fiery heart forth, sound the note
wanted by the throbbing throat
ay, and ever to the ending
cricket chirps at need
executes the hand's intending
promptly, perfectly,--indeed
saves the singer from defeat
with her chirrup low and sweet
till, at ending, all the judges
cry with one assent
such a voice and instrument
why, we took your lyre for harp
so it shrilled us forth f sharp
did the conqueror spurn the creature
once its service done
that's no such uncommon feature
in the case when music's son
finds his lotte's power too spent
for aiding soul-development
no! this other, on returning
homeward, prize in hand
satisfied his bosom's yearning
of this cricket's help to me
so, he made himself a statue
marble stood, life-size
on the lyre, he pointed at you
perched his partner in the prize
never more apart you found
her, he throned, from him, she crowned
that's the tale: its application
somebody i know
hopes one day for reputation
through his poetry that's--oh
all so learned and so wise
and deserving of a prize
if he gains one, will some ticket
when his statue's built
tell the gazer "'twas a cricket
helped my crippled lyre, whose lilt
sweet and low, when strength usurped
softness' place i' the scale, she chirped
while i sang and played
with my lyre at lowest, highest
right alike,--one string that made
never to be heard again
perched upon the place
vacant left, and duly uttered
asked the treble to atone
for its somewhat sombre drone
but you don't know music! wherefore
keep on casting pearls
to a--poet? all i care for
is--to tell him that a girl's
grows his singing. (there, enough
oh, the beautiful girl, too white
who lived at pornic, down by the sea
just where the sea and the loire unite
and a boasted name in brittany
she bore, which i will not write
too white, for the flower of life is red
her flesh was the soft seraphic screen
of a soul that is meant (her parents said
to just see earth, and hardly be seen
and blossom in heaven instead
yet earth saw one thing, one how fair
one grace that grew to its full on earth
smiles might be sparse on her cheek so spare
and her waist want half a girdle's girth
but she had her great gold hair
hair, such a wonder of flix and floss
freshness and fragrance--floods of it, too
gold, did i say? nay, gold's mere dross
here, life smiled, "think what i meant to do
and love sighed, "fancy my loss
so, when she died, it was scarce more strange
than that, when delicate evening dies
and you follow its spent sun's pallid range
there's a shoot of colour startles the skies
with sudden, violent change
that, while the breath was nearly to seek
as they put the little cross to her lips
she changed; a spot came out on her cheek
a spark from her eye in mid-eclipse
and she broke forth, "i must speak
but the last, last grace, my all, my own
let it stay in the grave, that the ghosts may know
leave my poor gold hair alone
the passion thus vented, dead lay she
her parents sobbed their worst on that
all friends joined in, nor observed degree
for indeed the hair was to wonder at
as it spread--not flowing free
but curled around her brow, like a crown
and coiled beside her cheeks, like a cap
and calmed about her neck--ay, down
to her breast, pressed flat, without a gap
i' the gold, it reached her gown
all kissed that face, like a silver wedge
e'en the priest allowed death's privilege
as he planted the crucifix with care
on her breast, 'twixt edge and edge
and thus was she buried, inviolate
of body and soul, in the very space
by the altar; keeping saintly state
in pornic church, for her pride of race
pure life and piteous fate
and in after-time would your fresh tear fall
though your mouth might twitch with a dubious smile
as they told you of gold, both robe and pall
how she prayed them leave it alone awhile
so it never was touched at all
years flew; this legend grew at last
the life of the lady; all she had done
all been, in the memories fading fast
of lover and friend, was summed in one
sentence survivors passed
to wit, she was meant for heaven, not earth
had turned an angel before the time
yet, since she was mortal, in such dearth
of frailty, all you could count a crime
was--she knew her gold hair's worth
it chanced, the pavement wanted repair
was taken to pieces: left in the lurch
a certain sacred space lay bare
and the boys began research
a benefactor,--a bishop, suppose
a baron with armour-adornments quaint
dame with chased ring and jewelled rose
things sanctity saves from taint
so we come to find them in after-days
when the corpse is presumed to have done with gauds
of use to the living, in many ways
for the boys get pelf, and the town applauds
and the church deserves the praise
they grubbed with a will: and at length--_o cor
humanum, pectora cæca_, and the rest
they found--no gaud they were prying for
no ring, no rose, but--who would have guessed
a double louis-d'or
here was a case for the priest: he heard
marked, inwardly digested, laid
finger on nose, smiled, "there's a bird
chirps in my ear:" then, "bring a spade
dig deeper!"--he gave the word
and lo, when they came to the coffin-lid
or rotten planks which composed it once
why, there lay the girl's skull wedged amid
a mint of money, it served for the nonce
to hold in its hair-heaps hid
hid there? why? could the girl be wont
money, earth's trash and heaven's affront
had a spider found out the communion-cup
was a toad in the christening-font
truth is truth: too true it was
gold! she hoarded and hugged it first
longed for it, leaned o'er it, loved it--alas
till the humour grew to a head and burst
and she cried, at the final pass
nor lover nor friend--be gold for both
gold i lack; and, my all, my own
it shall hide in my hair. i scarce die loth
if they let my hair alone
louis-d'or, some six times five
and duly double, every piece
now, do you see? with the priest to shrive
with parents preventing her soul's release
by kisses that kept alive
with heaven's gold gates about to ope
with friends' praise, gold-like, lingering still
an instinct had bidden the girl's hand grope
for gold, the true sort--"gold in heaven, if you will
but i keep earth's too, i hope
enough! the priest took the grave's grim yield
the parents, they eyed that price of sin
as if _thirty pieces_ lay revealed
on the place _to bury strangers in
the hideous potter's field
but the priest bethought him: "'milk that's spilt
saints tumble to earth with so slight a tilt
it would build a new altar; that, we may
and the altar therewith was built
why i deliver this horrible verse
as the text of a sermon, which now i preach
evil or good may be better or worse
in the human heart, but the mixture of each
is a marvel and a curse
the candid incline to surmise of late
that the christian faith proves false, i find
for our essays-and-reviews' debate
begins to tell on the public mind
and colenso's words have weight
i still, to suppose it true, for my part
see reasons and reasons; this, to begin
at the head of a lie--taught original sin
the corruption of man's heart
do you happen to know in ross-shire
mount ben ... but the name scarce matters
of the naked fact i am sure enough
though i clothe it in rags and tatters
you may recognise ben by description
behind him--a moor's immenseness
up goes the middle mount of a range
fringed with its firs in denseness
rimming the edge, its fir-fringe, mind
for an edge there is, though narrow
from end to end of the range, a strip
of path runs straight as an arrow
and the mountaineer who takes that path
saves himself miles of journey
he has to plod if he crosses the moor
through heather, peat, and burnie
but a mountaineer he needs must be
for, look you, right in the middle
projects bluff ben--with an end in _ich
why planted there, is a riddle
since all ben's brothers little and big
keep rank, set shoulder to shoulder
and only this burliest out must bulge
till it seems--to the beholder
from down in the gully,--as if ben's breast
to a sudden spike diminished
would signify to the boldest foot
yet the mountaineer who sidles on
and on to the very bending
discovers, if heart and brain be proof
no necessary ending
foot up, foot down, to the turn abrupt
having trod, he, there arriving
finds--what he took for a point was breadth
a mercy of nature's contriving
so, he rounds what, when 'tis reached, proves straight
from one side gains the other
the wee path widens--resume the march
and he foils you, ben my brother
but donald--(that name, i hope, will do
i wrong him if i call "foiling
the tramp of the callant, whistling the while
as blithe as our kettle's boiling
he had dared the danger from boyhood up
and now,--when perchance was waiting
a lass at the brig below,--'twixt mount
and moor would he standing debating
moreover this donald was twenty-five
a glory of bone and muscle
did a fiend dispute the right of way
donald would try a tussle
lightsomely marched he out of the broad
on to the narrow and narrow
a step more, rounding the angular rock
reached the front straight as an arrow
he stepped it, safe on the ledge he stood
when--whom found he full-facing
what fellow in courage and wariness too
had scouted ignoble pacing
and left low safety to timid mates
and made for the dread dear danger
and gained the height where--who could guess
he would meet with a rival ranger
gigantic and magnific
by the wonder--ay, and the peril--struck
intelligent and pacific
for a red deer is no fallow deer
grown cowardly through park-feeding
he batters you like a thunderbolt
if you brave his haunts unheeding
i doubt he could hardly perform _volte-face
had valour advised discretion
you may walk on a rope, but to turn on a rope
no blondin makes profession
yet donald must turn, would pride permit
though pride ill brooks retiring
each eyed each--mute man, motionless beast
less fearing than admiring
these are the moments when quite new sense
to meet some need as novel
springs up in the brain: it inspired resource
and slowly, surely, never a whit
relaxing the steady tension
of eye-stare which binds man to beast
by an inch and inch declension
sank donald sidewise down and down
till flat, breast upwards, lying
at his six-foot length, no corpse more still
minutes were an eternity
but a new sense was created
in the stag's brain too; he resolves! slow, sure
with eye-stare unabated
feelingly he extends a foot
which tastes the way ere it touches
earth's solid and just escapes man's soft
nor hold of the same unclutches
till its fellow foot, light as a feather whisk
lands itself no less finely
so a mother removes a fly from the face
of her babe asleep supinely
and now 'tis the haunch and hind-foot's turn
yes, traversing half the prostrate length
his hoof-tip does not graze it
just one more lift! but donald, you see
was sportsman first, man after
a fancy lightened his caution through
unrivalled, unexampled
all sporting feats with this feat matched
were down and dead and trampled
the last of the legs as tenderly
follows the rest: or never
or now is the time! his knife in reach
and his right hand loose--how clever
for this can stab up the stomach's soft
while the left hand grasps the pastern
a rise on the elbow, and--now's the time
or never: this turn's the last turn
i shall dare to place myself by god
who scanned--for he does--each feature
of the face thrown up in appeal to him
by the agonising creature
nay, i hear plain words: "thy gift brings this
up he sprang, back he staggered
over he fell, and with him our friend
yet he was not dead when they picked next day
from the gully's depth the wreck of him
his fall had been stayed by the stag beneath
who cushioned and saved the neck of him
but the rest of his body--why, doctors said
whatever could break was broken
legs, arms, ribs, all of him looked like a toast
in a tumbler of port wine soaken
said they when--the slow cure ended
they opened the hospital door, and thence
and minor damage left wisely alone
like an old shoe clouted and cobbled
out--what went in a goliath wellnigh
some half of a david hobbled
sell the stag's head for a bracket
with its grand twelve tines--i'd buy it myself
and use the skin for a jacket
he was wiser, made both head and hide
his win-penny: hands and knees on
would manage to crawl--poor crab--by the roads
in the misty stalking season
and if he discovered a bothy like this
why, harvest was sure: folk listened
he told his tale to the lovers of sport
lips twitched, cheeks glowed, eyes glistened
and when he had come to the close, and spread
his spoils for the gazers' wonder
with "gentlemen, here's the skull of the stag
i was over, thank god, not under
the company broke out in applause
have a munch of grouse and a hunk of bread
and a tug, besides, at our tipple
and "there's my pay for your pluck!" cried this
cried that, while t'other--but he was drunk
hiccupped "a trump, a tory
i hope i gave twice as much as the rest
for, as homer would say, "within grate
though teeth kept tongue," my whole soul growled
when a man's busy, why, leisure
strikes him as wonderful pleasure
straightway he wants to be busy
here we've got peace; and aghast i'm
caught thinking war the true pastime
is there a reason in metre
give us your speech, master peter
i who, if mortal dare say so
ne'er am at a loss with my naso
men are the merest ixions
here the king whistled aloud, "let's
such are the sorrowful chances
if you talk fine to king francis
and so, to the courtyard proceeding
our company, francis was leading
increased by new followers tenfold
before he arrived at the penfold
lords, ladies, like clouds which bedizen
at sunset the western horizon
and sir de lorge pressed 'mid the foremost
with the dame he professed to adore most
oh, what a face! one by fits eyed
her, and the horrible pitside
for the penfold surrounded a hollow
which led where the eye scarce dared follow
and shelved to the chamber secluded
where bluebeard, the great lion, brooded
the king hailed his keeper, an arab
as glossy and black as a scarab
and bade him make sport and at once stir
up and out of his den the old monster
they opened a hole in the wire-work
across it, and dropped there a firework
and fled: one's heart's beating redoubled
a pause, while the pit's mouth was troubled
the blackness and silence so utter
by the firework's slow sparkling and sputter
then earth in a sudden contortion
gave out to our gaze her abortion
such a brute! were i friend clement marot
and whose faculties move in no small mist
when he versifies david the psalmist
i should study that brute to describe you
one's whole blood grew curdling and creepy
to see the black mane, vast and heapy
the tail in the air stiff and straining
the wide eyes, nor waxing nor waning
as over the barrier which bounded
his platform, and us who surrounded
the barrier, they reached and they rested
on space that might stand him in best stead
for who knew, he thought, what the amazement
the eruption of clatter and blaze meant
and if, in this minute of wonder
no outlet, 'mid lightning and thunder
lay broad, and, his shackles all shivered
the lion at last was delivered
ay, that was the open sky o'erhead
and you saw by the flash on his forehead
by the hope in those eyes wide and steady
he was leagues in the desert already
driving the flocks up the mountain
or catlike couched hard by the fountain
to waylay the date-gathering negress
so guarded he entrance or egress
and so can afford the confession
we exercise wholesome discretion
in keeping aloof from his threshold
once hold you, those jaws want no fresh hold
their first would too pleasantly purloin
the visitor's brisket or sirloin
but who's he would prove so foolhardy
not the best man of marignan, pardie
the sentence no sooner was uttered
than over the rails a glove fluttered
fell close to the lion, and rested
the dame 'twas, who flung it and jested
with life so, de lorge had been wooing
for months past; he sat there pursuing
his suit, weighing out with nonchalance
fine speeches like gold from a balance
sound the trumpet, no true knight's a tarrier
de lorge made one leap at the barrier
walked straight to the glove,--while the lion
ne'er moved, kept his far-reaching eye on
the palm-tree-edged desert-spring's sapphire
and the musky oiled skin of the kaffir
picked it up, and as calmly retreated
leaped back where the lady was seated
and full in the face of its owner
flung the glove
so should i!"--cried the king--"'twas mere vanity
not love, set that task to humanity
lords and ladies alike turned with loathing
from such a proved wolf in sheep's clothing
not so, i; for i caught an expression
in her brow's undisturbed self-possession
amid the court's scoffing and merriment
as if from no pleasing experiment
she rose, yet of pain not much heedful
so long as the process was needful
as if she had tried in a crucible
to what "speeches like gold" were reducible
and, finding the finest prove copper
felt the smoke in her face was but proper
to know what she had _not_ to trust to
was worth all the ashes and dust too
she went out 'mid hooting and laughter
clement marot stayed; i followed after
and asked, as a grace, what it all meant
if she wished not the rash deed's recallment
human nature,--behooves that i know it
she told me, "too long had i heard
of the deed proved alone by the word
for my love--what de lorge would not dare
with my scorn--what de lorge could compare
and the endless descriptions of death
he would brave when my lip formed a breath
i must reckon as braved, or, of course
doubt his word--and moreover, perforce
for such gifts as no lady could spurn
must offer my love in return
when i looked on your lion, it brought
all the dangers at once to my thought
encountered by all sorts of men
before he was lodged in his den
from the poor slave whose club or bare hands
dug the trap, set the snare on the sands
with no king and no court to applaud
by no shame, should he shrink, overawed
yet to capture the creature made shift
that his rude boys might laugh at the gift
of the pit, on no greater pretence
than to get back the bonnet he dropped
lest his pay for a week should be stopped
so, wiser i judged it to make
one trial what 'death for my sake
really meant, while the power was yet mine
than to wait until time should define
who took it to mean just 'to die
the blow a glove gives is but weak
does the mark yet discolour my cheek
but when the heart suffers a blow
will the pain pass so soon, do you know
i looked, as away she was sweeping
and saw a youth eagerly keeping
as close as he dared to the doorway
no doubt that a noble should more weigh
his life than befits a plebeian
and yet, had our brute been nemean
the youth stepped with, forward to serve her
if you whispered, "friend, what you'd get, first earn
and when, shortly after, she carried
her shame from the court, and they married
to that marriage some happiness, maugre
the voice of the court, i dared augur
How sweet is the shepherdâs sweet lot!
From the morn to the evening he strays;
He shall follow his sheep all the day,
And his tongue shall be fillÃ¨d with praise.
For he hears the lambsâ innocent call,
And he hears the ewesâ tender reply;
He is watchful while they are in peace,
For they know when their shepherd is nigh.
The sun does arise,
And make happy the skies;
The merry bells ring
To welcome the Spring;
The skylark and thrush,
The birds of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bellsâ cheerful sound;
While our sports shall be seen
On the echoing green.
Old John, with white hair,
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak,
Among the old folk.
They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say,
âSuch, such were the joys
When we allâgirls and boysâ
In our youth-time were seen
On the echoing green.â
Till the little ones, weary,
No more can be merry:
The sun does descend,
And our sports have an end.
Round the laps of their mothers
Many sisters and brothers,
Like birds in their nest,
Are ready for rest,
And sport no more seen
On the darkening green.
   Little lamb, who made thee?
   Does thou know who made thee,
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
By the stream and oâer the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight,
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice,
Making all the vales rejoice?
   Little lamb, who made thee?
   Does thou know who made thee?
   Little lamb, Iâll tell thee;
   Little lamb, Iâll tell thee:
He is callÃ¨d by thy name,
For He calls Himself a Lamb.
He is meek, and He is mild,
He became a little child.
I a child, and thou a lamb,
We are callÃ¨d by His name.
   Little lamb, God bless thee!
   Little lamb, God bless thee!
My mother bore me in the southern wild,
   And I am black, but O my soul is white!
White as an angel is the English child,
   But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
My mother taught me underneath a tree,
   And, sitting down before the heat of day,
She took me on her lap and kissÃ¨d me,
   And, pointing to the East, began to say:
âLook on the rising sun: there God does live,
   And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
   Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.
âAnd we are put on earth a little space,
   That we may learn to bear the beams of love;
And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
   Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
âFor, when our souls have learned the heat to bear,
   The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
Saying, âCome out from the grove, my love and care,
   And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.ââ
Thus did my mother say, and kissed me,
   And thus I say to little English boy.
When I from black, and he from white cloud free,
   And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,
Iâll shade him from the heat till he can bear
   To lean in joy upon our Fatherâs knee;
And then Iâll stand and stroke his silver hair,
   And be like him, and he will then love me.
Merry, merry sparrow!
Under leaves so green
A happy blossom
Sees you, swift as arrow,
Seek your cradle narrow,
Near my bosom.
Pretty, pretty robin!
Under leaves so green
A happy blossom
Hears you sobbing, sobbing,
Pretty, pretty robin,
Near my bosom.
When my mother died I was very young,
And my father sold me while yet my tongue
Could scarcely cry âWeep! weep! weep! weep!â
So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
Thereâs little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
That curled like a lambâs back, was shaved; so I said,
âHush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your headâs bare,
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.â
And so he was quiet, and that very night,
As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!â
That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
And by came an angel, who had a bright key,
And he opened the coffins, and set them all free;
Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run
And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.
Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind:
And the angel told Tom, if heâd be a good boy,
Heâd have God for his father, and never want joy.
And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,
And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:
So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
âFather, father, where are you going?
   O do not walk so fast!
   Speak, father, speak to your little boy,
Or else I shall be lost.â
The night was dark, no father was there,
   The child was wet with dew;
The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
   And away the vapour flew.
The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
   Led by the wandering light,
   Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
Appeared like his father, in white.
He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
   And to his mother brought,
Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
   Her little boy weeping sought.
When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
When the meadows laugh with lively green,
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;
When Mary and Susan and Emily
With their sweet round mouths sing âHa ha he!â
When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
To sing the sweet chorus of âHa ha he!â
Sweet dreams, form a shade
Oâer my lovely infantâs head!
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
By happy, silent, moony beams!
Sweet Sleep, with soft down
Weave thy brows an infant crown!
Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
Hover oâer my happy child!
Sweet smiles, in the night
Hover over my delight!
Sweet smiles, motherâs smiles,
All the livelong night beguiles.
Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
Chase not slumber from thy eyes!
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,
All the dovelike moans beguiles.
Sleep, sleep, happy child!
All creation slept and smiled.
Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
While oâer thee thy mother weep.
Sweet babe, in thy face
Holy image I can trace;
Sweet babe, once like thee
Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:
Wept for me, for thee, for all,
When He was an infant small.
Thou His image ever see,
Heavenly face that smiles on thee!
Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
Who became an infant small;
Infant smiles are His own smiles;
Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.
To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
   All pray in their distress,
   And to these virtues of delight
Return their thankfulness.
For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
   Is God our Father dear;
And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
   Is man, His child and care.
For Mercy has a human heart;
   Pity, a human face;
And Love, the human form divine:
   And Peace the human dress.
Then every man, of every clime,
   That prays in his distress,
Prays to the human form divine:
   Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
And all must love the human form,
   In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
   There God is dwelling too.
âTwas on a holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
The children walking two and two, in red, and blue, and green:
Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,
Till into the high dome of Paulâs they like Thames waters flow.
O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!
Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.
The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.
Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:
Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor.
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.
The sun descending in the West,
The evening star does shine;
The birds are silent in their nest,
And I must seek for mine.
   The moon, like a flower
   In heavenâs high bower,
   With silent delight,
   Sits and smiles on the night.
Farewell, green fields and happy groves,
Where flocks have took delight,
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
The feet of angels bright;
   Unseen, they pour blessing,
   And joy without ceasing,
   On each bud and blossom,
   And each sleeping bosom.
They look in every thoughtless nest
Where birds are covered warm;
They visit caves of every beast,
To keep them all from harm:
   If they see any weeping
   That should have been sleeping,
   They pour sleep on their head,
   And sit down by their bed.
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
They pitying stand and weep;
Seeking to drive their thirst away,
And keep them from the sheep.
   But, if they rush dreadful,
   The angels, most heedful,
   Receive each mild spirit,
   New worlds to inherit.
And there the lionâs ruddy eyes
Shall flow with tears of gold:
And pitying the tender cries,
And walking round the fold:
   Saying: âWrath by His meekness,
   And, by His health, sickness,
   Is driven away
   From our immortal day.
âAnd now beside thee, bleating lamb,
I can lie down and sleep,
Or think on Him who bore thy name,
Graze after thee, and weep.
   For, washed in lifeâs river,
   My bright mane for ever
   Shall shine like the gold,
   As I guard oâer the fold.â
      Sound the flute!
      Now itâs mute!
      Birds delight,
      Day and night,
      Nightingale,
      In the dale,
      Lark in sky,â
      Merrily,
Merrily, merrily to welcome in the year.
      Little boy,
      Full of joy;
      Little girl,
      Sweet and small;
      Cock does crow,
      So do you;
      Merry voice,
      Infant noise;
Merrily, merrily to welcome in the year.
      Little lamb,
      Here I am;
      Come and lick
      My white neck;
      Let me pull
      Your soft wool;
      Let me kiss
      Your soft face;
Merrily, merrily we welcome in the year.
When voices of children are heard on the green,
   And laughing is heard on the hill,
My heart is at rest within my breast,
   And everything else is still.
âThen come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
   And the dews of night arise;
Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
   Till the morning appears in the skies.â
âNo, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
   And we cannot go to sleep;
Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
   And the hills are all covered with sheep.â
âWell, well, go and play till the light fades away,
   And then go home to bed.â
The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,
   And all the hills echoÃ¨d.
âI have no name;
I am but two days old.â
What shall I call thee?
âI happy am,
Joy is my name.â
Sweet joy befall thee!
Pretty joy!
Sweet joy, but two days old.
Sweet joy I call thee:
Thou dost smile,
I sing the while;
Sweet joy befall thee!
Once a dream did weave a shade
Oâer my angel-guarded bed,
That an emmet lost its way
Where on grass methought I lay.
Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
Over many a tangled spray,
All heart-broke, I heard her say:
âO my children! do they cry,
Do they hear their father sigh?
Now they look abroad to see,
Now return and weep for me.â
Pitying, I dropped a tear:
But I saw a glow-worm near,
Who replied, âWhat wailing wight
Calls the watchman of the night?â
âI am set to light the ground,
While the beetle goes his round:
Follow now the beetleâs hum;
Little wanderer, hie thee home!â
Can I see anotherâs woe,
And not be in sorrow too?
Can I see anotherâs grief,
And not seek for kind relief?
Can I see a falling tear,
And not feel my sorrowâs share?
Can a father see his child
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
Can a mother sit and hear
An infant groan, an infant fear?
No, no! never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
And can He who smiles on all
Hear the wren with sorrows small,
Hear the small birdâs grief and care,
Hear the woes that infants bearâ
And not sit beside the nest,
Pouring pity in their breast,
And not sit the cradle near,
Weeping tear on infantâs tear?
And not sit both night and day,
Wiping all our tears away?
O no! never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
He doth give His joy to all:
He becomes an infant small,
He becomes a man of woe,
He doth feel the sorrow too.
Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
And thy Maker is not by:
Think not thou canst weep a tear,
And thy Maker is not near.
O He gives to us His joy,
That our grief He may destroy:
Till our grief is fled and gone
He doth sit by us and moan.
INTRODUCTION
Hear the voice of the Bard,
Who present, past, and future, sees;
Whose ears have heard
The Holy Word
That walked among the ancient trees;
Calling the lapsÃ©d soul,
And weeping in the evening dew;
That might control
The starry pole,
And fallen, fallen light renew!
âO Earth, O Earth, return!
Arise from out the dewy grass!
Night is worn,
And the morn
Rises from the slumbrous mass.
âTurn away no more;
Why wilt thou turn away?
The starry floor,
The watery shore,
Is given thee till the break of day.â
Earth raised up her head
From the darkness dread and drear,
Her light fled,
Stony, dread,
And her locks covered with grey despair.
âPrisoned on watery shore,
Starry jealousy does keep my den
Cold and hoar;
Weeping oâer,
I hear the father of the ancient men.
âSelfish father of men!
Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!
Can delight,
Chained in night,
The virgins of youth and morning bear.
âDoes spring hide its joy,
When buds and blossoms grow?
Does the sower
Sow by night,
Or the ploughman in darkness plough?
âBreak this heavy chain,
That does freeze my bones around!
Selfish, vain,
Eternal bane,
That free love with bondage bound.â
âLove seeketh not itself to please,
   Nor for itself hath any care,
But for another gives its ease,
   And builds a heaven in hellâs despair.â
So sung a little clod of clay,
   Trodden with the cattleâs feet,
But a pebble of the brook
   Warbled out these metres meet:
âLove seeketh only Self to please,
   To bind another to its delight,
Joys in anotherâs loss of ease,
   And builds a hell in heavenâs despite.â
Is this a holy thing to see
   In a rich and fruitful land,â
Babes reduced to misery,
   Fed with cold and usurous hand?
Is that trembling cry a song?
   Can it be a song of joy?
And so many children poor?
   It is a land of poverty!
And their sun does never shine,
   And their fields are bleak and bare,
And their ways are filled with thorns,
   It is eternal winter there.
For whereâer the sun does shine,
   And whereâer the rain does fall,
Babe can never hunger there,
   Nor poverty the mind appal.
In futurity
I prophesy
That the earth from sleep
(Grave the sentence deep)
Shall arise, and seek
For her Maker meek;
And the desert wild
Become a garden mild.
In the southern clime,
Where the summerâs prime
Never fades away,
Lovely Lyca lay.
Seven summers old
Lovely Lyca told.
She had wandered long,
Hearing wild birdsâ song.
âSweet sleep, come to me,
Underneath this tree;
Do father, mother, weep?
Where can Lyca sleep?
âLost in desert wild
Is your little child.
How can Lyca sleep
If her mother weep?
âIf her heart does ache,
Then let Lyca wake;
If my mother sleep,
Lyca shall not weep.
âFrowning, frowning night,
Oâer this desert bright
Let thy moon arise,
While I close my eyes.â
Sleeping Lyca lay,
While the beasts of prey,
Come from caverns deep,
Viewed the maid asleep.
The kingly lion stood,
And the virgin viewed:
Then he gambolled round
Oâer the hallowed ground.
Leopards, tigers, play
Round her as she lay;
While the lion old
Bowed his mane of gold,
And her bosom lick,
And upon her neck,
From his eyes of flame,
Ruby tears there came;
While the lioness
Loosed her slender dress,
And naked they conveyed
To caves the sleeping maid.
All the night in woe
Lycaâs parents go
Over valleys deep,
While the deserts weep.
Tired and woe-begone,
Hoarse with making moan,
Arm in arm, seven days
They traced the desert ways.
Seven nights they sleep
Among shadows deep,
And dream they see their child
Starved in desert wild.
Pale through pathless ways
The fancied image strays,
Famished, weeping, weak,
With hollow piteous shriek.
Rising from unrest,
The trembling woman pressed
With feet of weary woe;
She could no further go.
In his arms he bore
Her, armed with sorrow sore;
Till before their way
A couching lion lay.
Turning back was vain:
Soon his heavy mane
Bore them to the ground,
Then he stalked around,
Smelling to his prey;
But their fears allay
When he licks their hands,
And silent by them stands.
They look upon his eyes,
Filled with deep surprise;
And wondering behold
A spirit armed in gold.
On his head a crown,
On his shoulders down
Flowed his golden hair.
Gone was all their care.
âFollow me,â he said;
âWeep not for the maid;
In my palace deep,
Lyca lies asleep.â
Then they followÃ¨d
Where the vision led,
And saw their sleeping child
Among tigers wild.
To this day they dwell
In a lonely dell,
Nor fear the wolvish howl
Nor the lionâs growl.
A little black thing among the snow,
Crying! âweep! weep!â in notes of woe!
âWhere are thy father and mother?  Say!ââ
âThey are both gone up to the church to pray.
âBecause I was happy upon the heath,
And smiled among the winterâs snow,
They clothed me in the clothes of death,
And taught me to sing the notes of woe.
âAnd because I am happy and dance and sing,
They think they have done me no injury,
And are gone to praise God and His priest and king,
Who made up a heaven of our misery.â
When the voices of children are heard on the green,
   And whisperings are in the dale,
The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
   My face turns green and pale.
Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
   And the dews of night arise;
Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
   And your winter and night in disguise.
O rose, thou art sick!
   The invisible worm,
That flies in the night,
   In the howling storm,
Has found out thy bed
   Of crimson joy,
And his dark secret love
   Does thy life destroy.
Little Fly,
Thy summerâs play
My thoughtless hand
Has brushed away.
Am not I
A fly like thee?
Or art not thou
A man like me?
For I dance,
And drink, and sing,
Till some blind hand
Shall brush my wing.
If thought is life
And strength and breath,
And the want
Of thought is death;
Then am I
A happy fly.
If I live,
Or if I die.
I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
And that I was a maiden Queen
Guarded by an Angel mild:
Witless woe was neâer beguiled!
And I wept both night and day,
And he wiped my tears away;
And I wept both day and night,
And hid from him my heartâs delight.
So he took his wings, and fled;
Then the morn blushed rosy red.
I dried my tears, and armed my fears
With ten thousand shields and spears.
Soon my Angel came again;
I was armed, he came in vain;
For the time of youth was fled,
And grey hairs were on my head.
Tiger, tiger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And, when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?
Tiger, tiger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
A flower was offered to me,
   Such a flower as May never bore;
But I said, âIâve a pretty rose tree,â
   And I passed the sweet flower oâer.
Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
   To tend her by day and by night;
But my rose turned away with jealousy,
   And her thorns were my only delight.
Ah, sunflower, weary of time,
   Who countest the steps of the sun;
Seeking after that sweet golden clime
   Where the travellerâs journey is done;
Where the Youth pined away with desire,
   And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
Arise from their graves, and aspire
   Where my Sunflower wishes to go!
The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
The humble sheep a threatâning horn:
While the Lily white shall in love delight,
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.
I went to the Garden of Love,
   And saw what I never had seen;
A Chapel was built in the midst,
   Where I used to play on the green.
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,
   And âThou shalt notâ writ over the door;
So I turned to the Garden of Love
   That so many sweet flowers bore.
And I saw it was filled with graves,
   And tombstones where flowers should be;
And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
   And binding with briars my joys and desires.
Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;
But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.
Besides, I can tell where I am used well;
Such usage in heaven will never do well.
But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
Weâd sing and weâd pray all the livelong day,
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.
Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
And weâd be as happy as birds in the spring;
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.
And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
His children as pleasant and happy as He,
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.
I wander through each chartered street,
   Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
A mark in every face I meet,
   Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
In every cry of every man,
   In every infantâs cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
   The mind-forged manacles I hear:
How the chimney-sweeperâs cry
   Every blackening church appals,
And the hapless soldierâs sigh
   Runs in blood down palace-walls.
But most, through midnight streets I hear
   How the youthful harlotâs curse
Blasts the new-born infantâs tear,
   And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.
Pity would be no more
If we did not make somebody poor,
And Mercy no more could be
If all were as happy as we.
And mutual fear brings Peace,
Till the selfish loves increase;
Then Cruelty knits a snare,
And spreads his baits with care.
He sits down with holy fears,
And waters the ground with tears;
Then Humility takes its root
Underneath his foot.
Soon spreads the dismal shade
Of Mystery over his head,
And the caterpillar and fly
Feed on the Mystery.
And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
Ruddy and sweet to eat,
And the raven his nest has made
In its thickest shade.
The gods of the earth and sea
Sought through nature to find this tree,
But their search was all in vain:
There grows one in the human Brain.
My mother groaned, my father wept:
Into the dangerous world I leapt,
Helpless, naked, piping loud,
Like a fiend hid in a cloud.
Struggling in my fatherâs hands,
Striving against my swaddling bands,
Bound and weary, I thought best
To sulk upon my motherâs breast.
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears,
And I sunnÃ¨d it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright,
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,â
And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning, glad, I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
âNought loves another as itself,
   Nor venerates another so,
Nor is it possible to thought
   A greater than itself to know.
âAnd, father, how can I love you
   Or any of my brothers more?
I love you like the little bird
   That picks up crumbs around the door.â
The Priest sat by and heard the child;
   In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
He led him by his little coat,
   And all admired his priestly care.
And standing on the altar high,
   âLo, what a fiend is here!â said he:
âOne who sets reason up for judge
   Of our most holy mystery.â
The weeping child could not be heard,
   The weeping parents wept in vain:
They stripped him to his little shirt,
   And bound him in an iron chain,
And burned him in a holy place
   Where many had been burned before;
The weeping parents wept in vain.
   Are such things done on Albionâs shore?
Children of the future age,
Reading this indignant page,
Know that in a former time
Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.
In the age of gold,
Free from winterâs cold,
Youth and maiden bright,
To the holy light,
Naked in the sunny beams delight.
Once a youthful pair,
Filled with softest care,
Met in garden bright
Where the holy light
Had just removed the curtains of the night.
There, in rising day,
On the grass they play;
Parents were afar,
Strangers came not near,
And the maiden soon forgot her fear.
Tired with kisses sweet,
They agree to meet
When the silent sleep
Waves oâer heavenâs deep,
And the weary tired wanderers weep.
To her father white
Came the maiden bright;
But his loving look,
Like the holy book,
All her tender limbs with terror shook.
Ona, pale and weak,
To thy father speak!
O the trembling fear!
O the dismal care
That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!â
Cruelty has a human heart,
   And Jealousy a human face;
Terror the human form divine,
   And Secrecy the human dress.
The human dress is forgÃ¨d iron,
   The human form a fiery forge,
The human face a furnace sealed,
   The human heart its hungry gorge.
Sleep, sleep, beauty bright,
Dreaming in the joys of night;
Sleep, sleep; in thy sleep
Little sorrows sit and weep.
Sweet babe, in thy face
Soft desires I can trace,
Secret joys and secret smiles,
Little pretty infant wiles.
As thy softest limbs I feel,
Smiles as of the morning steal
Oâer thy cheek, and oâer thy breast
Where thy little heart doth rest.
O the cunning wiles that creep
In thy little heart asleep!
When thy little heart doth wake,
Then the dreadful light shall break.
I love to rise in a summer morn,
   When the birds sing on every tree;
The distant huntsman winds his horn,
   And the skylark sings with me:
   O what sweet company!
But to go to school in a summer morn,â
   O it drives all joy away!
Under a cruel eye outworn,
   The little ones spend the day
   In sighing and dismay.
Ah then at times I drooping sit,
   And spend many an anxious hour;
Nor in my book can I take delight,
   Nor sit in learningâs bower,
   Worn through with the dreary shower.
How can the bird that is born for joy
   Sit in a cage and sing?
How can a child, when fears annoy,
   But droop his tender wing,
   And forget his youthful spring!
O father and mother if buds are nipped,
   And blossoms blown away;
And if the tender plants are stripped
   Of their joy in the springing day,
   By sorrow and careâs dismay,â
How shall the summer arise in joy,
   Or the summer fruits appear?
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
   Or bless the mellowing year,
   When the blasts of winter appear?
Whateâer is born of mortal birth
Must be consumÃ¨d with the earth,
To rise from generation free:
Then what have I to do with thee?
The sexes sprung from shame and pride,
Blowed in the morn, in evening died;
But mercy changed death into sleep;
The sexes rose to work and weep.
Thou, mother of my mortal part,
With cruelty didst mould my heart,
And with false self-deceiving tears
Didst blind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,
Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
And me to mortal life betray.
The death of Jesus set me free:
Then what have I to do with thee?
Youth of delight! come hither
And see the opening morn,
Image of Truth new-born.
Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,
Dark disputes and artful teazing.
Folly is an endless maze;
Tangled roots perplex her ways;
How many have fallen there!
They stumble all night over bones of the dead;
And feelâthey know not what but care;
And wish to lead others, when they should be led.
IN the midway of this our mortal life,
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray
Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell
It were no easy task, how savage wild
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,
Which to remember only, my dismay
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.
Yet to discourse of what there good befell,
All else will I relate discover'd there.
How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd
My senses down, when the true path I left,
But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd
The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,
I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad
Already vested with that planet's beam,
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
Then was a little respite to the fear,
That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,
All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:
And as a man, with difficult short breath,
Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd
Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,
That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame
After short pause recomforted, again
I journey'd on over that lonely steep,
The hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent
Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,
And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,
Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove
To check my onward going; that ofttimes
With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.
The hour was morning's prime, and on his way
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,
That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd
Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin
Of that swift animal, the matin dawn
And the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas'd,
And by new dread succeeded, when in view
A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,
With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,
That e'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf
Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd
Full of all wants, and many a land hath made
Disconsolate ere now.  She with such fear
O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,
That of the height all hope I lost.  As one,
Who with his gain elated, sees the time
When all unwares is gone, he inwardly
Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,
Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,
Who coming o'er against me, by degrees
Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.
While to the lower space with backward step
I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,
Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.
When him in that great desert I espied,
"Have mercy on me!" cried I out aloud,
"Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!"
He answer'd: "Now not man, man once I was,
And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both
By country, when the power of Julius yet
Was scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past
Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time
Of fabled deities and false.  A bard
Was I, and made Anchises' upright son
The subject of my song, who came from Troy,
When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.
But thou, say wherefore to such perils past
Return'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount
Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?"
"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,
From which such copious floods of eloquence
Have issued?"  I with front abash'd replied.
"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!
May it avail me that I long with zeal
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense
Have conn'd it o'er.  My master thou and guide!
Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd
That style, which for its beauty into fame
Exalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled.
O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!"
"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
She hath made tremble."  He, soon as he saw
That I was weeping, answer'd, "Thou must needs
Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape
From out that savage wilderness.  This beast,
At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none
To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:
So bad and so accursed in her kind,
That never sated is her ravenous will,
Still after food more craving than before.
To many an animal in wedlock vile
She fastens, and shall yet to many more,
Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy
Her with sharp pain.  He will not life support
By earth nor its base metals, but by love,
Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be
The land 'twixt either Feltro.  In his might
Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,
For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,
Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.
He with incessant chase through every town
Shall worry, until he to hell at length
Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.
I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,
That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see
Spirits of old tormented, who invoke
A second death; and those next view, who dwell
Content in fire, for that they hope to come,
Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,
Into whose regions if thou then desire
T' ascend, a spirit worthier than I
Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,
Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,
Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,
Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,
That to his city none through me should come.
He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds
His citadel and throne.  O happy those,
Whom there he chooses!"  I to him in few:
"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,
I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse
I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,
That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those
Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
CANTO II
NOW was the day departing, and the air,
Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd
All animals on earth; and I alone
Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,
Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,
Which my unerring memory shall retrace.
O Muses!  O high genius! now vouchsafe
Your aid!  O mind! that all I saw hast kept
Safe in a written record, here thy worth
And eminent endowments come to proof.
I thus began: "Bard! thou who art my guide,
Consider well, if virtue be in me
Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise
Thou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,
Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among
Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there
Sensible present.  Yet if heaven's great Lord,
Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,
In contemplation of the high effect,
Both what and who from him should issue forth,
It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:
Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,
In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:
Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd
And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits
Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.
He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,
Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise
And to the papal robe.  In after-times
The chosen vessel also travel'd there,
To bring us back assurance in that faith,
Which is the entrance to salvation's way.
But I, why should I there presume?  or who
Permits it?  not Aeneas I nor Paul.
Myself I deem not worthy, and none else
Will deem me.  I, if on this voyage then
I venture, fear it will in folly end.
Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,
Than I can speak."  As one, who unresolves
What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts
Changes his purpose, from his first intent
Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,
Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first
So eagerly embrac'd.  "If right thy words
I scan," replied that shade magnanimous,
"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft
So overcasts a man, that he recoils
From noblest resolution, like a beast
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,
I will instruct thee why I came, and what
I heard in that same instant, when for thee
Grief touch'd me first.  I was among the tribe,
Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest
And lovely, I besought her to command,
Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star
Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft
Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:
"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame
Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!
A friend, not of my fortune but myself,
On the wide desert in his road has met
Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.
Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,
And I be ris'n too late for his relief,
From what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,
And by all means for his deliverance meet,
Assist him.  So to me will comfort spring.
I who now bid thee on this errand forth
Am Beatrice; from a place I come
(Note: Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is
pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four
syllables, of which the third is a long one.)
Revisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,
Who prompts my speech.  When in my Master's sight
I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell."
She then was silent, and I thus began:
"O Lady! by whose influence alone,
Mankind excels whatever is contain'd
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,
So thy command delights me, that to obey,
If it were done already, would seem late.
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth
To leave that ample space, where to return
Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath."
She then: "Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,
I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread
Hinders my entrance here.  Those things alone
Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,
None else, for none are terrible beside.
I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!
That any suff'rance of your misery
Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire
Assails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame
Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief
That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,
That God's stern judgment to her will inclines."
To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:
"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
And I commend him to thee."  At her word
Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,
And coming to the place, where I abode
Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,
She thus address'd me: "Thou true praise of God!
Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent
To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave
For thy sake all the multitude admires?
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,
Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,
Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?"
"Ne'er among men did any with such speed
Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,
As when these words were spoken, I came here,
Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force
Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all
Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings."
"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes
Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt
Redoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will'd,
Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,
Who thy near way across the goodly mount
Prevented.  What is this comes o'er thee then?
Why, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast
Harbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there
And noble daring?  Since three maids so blest
Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;
And so much certain good my words forebode."
As florets, by the frosty air of night
Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;
So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,
And to my heart such kindly courage ran,
That I as one undaunted soon replied:
"O full of pity she, who undertook
My succour! and thou kind who didst perform
So soon her true behest!  With such desire
Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,
That my first purpose fully is resum'd.
Lead on: one only will is in us both.
Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord."
So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,
I enter'd on the deep and woody way.
CANTO III
"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:
Through me you pass into eternal pain:
Through me among the people lost for aye.
Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:
To rear me was the task of power divine,
Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.
Before me things create were none, save things
Eternal, and eternal I endure.
"All hope abandon ye who enter here."
Such characters in colour dim I mark'd
Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:
Whereat I thus: "Master, these words import
Hard meaning."  He as one prepar'd replied:
"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;
Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come
Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
To misery doom'd, who intellectual good
Have lost."  And when his hand he had stretch'd forth
To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,
Into that secret place he led me on.
Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
Resounded through the air pierc'd by no star,
That e'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,
Horrible languages, outcries of woe,
Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,
With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,
Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls
Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:
"O master!  What is this I hear?  What race
Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?"
He thus to me: "This miserable fate
Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd
Without or praise or blame, with that ill band
Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd
Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves
Were only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,
Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth
Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe
Should glory thence with exultation vain."
I then: "Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,
That they lament so loud?"  He straight replied:
"That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death
No hope may entertain: and their blind life
So meanly passes, that all other lots
They envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,
Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by."
And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,
Which whirling ran around so rapidly,
That it no pause obtain'd: and following came
Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er
Have thought, that death so many had despoil'd.
When some of these I recogniz'd, I saw
And knew the shade of him, who to base fear
Yielding, abjur'd his high estate.  Forthwith
I understood for certain this the tribe
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
And to his foes.  These wretches, who ne'er lived,
Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung
By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks
With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,
And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.
Then looking farther onwards I beheld
A throng upon the shore of a great stream:
Whereat I thus: "Sir! grant me now to know
Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem
So eager to pass o'er, as I discern
Through the blear light?"  He thus to me in few:
"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive
Beside the woeful tide of Acheron."
Then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,
Fearing my words offensive to his ear,
Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech
Abstain'd.  And lo! toward us in a bark
Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,
Crying, "Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not
Ever to see the sky again.  I come
To take you to the other shore across,
Into eternal darkness, there to dwell
In fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there
Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave
These who are dead."  But soon as he beheld
I left them not, "By other way," said he,
"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,
Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat
Must carry."  Then to him thus spake my guide:
"Charon! thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,
Where will and power are one: ask thou no more."
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Of him the boatman o'er the livid lake,
Around whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames.  Meanwhile
Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,
And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words
They heard.  God and their parents they blasphem'd,
The human kind, the place, the time, and seed
That did engender them and give them birth.
Then all together sorely wailing drew
To the curs'd strand, that every man must pass
Who fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,
With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,
Beck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar
Strikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,
One still another following, till the bough
Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;
E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood
Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,
Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.
Thus go they over through the umber'd wave,
And ever they on the opposing bank
Be landed, on this side another throng
Still gathers.  "Son," thus spake the courteous guide,
"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,
All here together come from every clime,
And to o'erpass the river are not loth:
For so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear
Is turn'd into desire.  Hence ne'er hath past
Good spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,
Now mayst thou know the import of his words."
This said, the gloomy region trembling shook
So terribly, that yet with clammy dews
Fear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,
That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,
Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I
Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.
CANTO IV
BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash
Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,
As one by main force rous'd.  Risen upright,
My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd
With fixed ken to know what place it was,
Wherein I stood.  For certain on the brink
I found me of the lamentable vale,
The dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound
Of plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,
And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain
Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.
"Now let us to the blind world there beneath
Descend;" the bard began all pale of look:
"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."
Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:
"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"
He then: "The anguish of that race below
With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear
Mistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way
Urges to haste."  Onward, this said, he mov'd;
And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds
Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.
Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard
Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air
Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief
Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,
Of men, women, and infants.  Then to me
The gentle guide: "Inquir'st thou not what spirits
Are these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass
Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin
Were blameless; and if aught they merited,
It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,
The portal to thy faith.  If they before
The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;
And among such am I. For these defects,
And for no other evil, we are lost;"
"Only so far afflicted, that we live
Desiring without hope."  So grief assail'd
My heart at hearing this, for well I knew
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
Of mighty worth.  "O tell me, sire rever'd!
Tell me, my master!"  I began through wish
Of full assurance in that holy faith,
Which vanquishes all error; "say, did e'er
Any, or through his own or other's merit,
Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?"
Piercing the secret purport of my speech,
He answer'd: "I was new to that estate,
When I beheld a puissant one arrive
Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.
He forth the shade of our first parent drew,
Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,
Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,
Israel with his sire and with his sons,
Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,
And others many more, whom he to bliss
Exalted.  Before these, be thou assur'd,
No spirit of human kind was ever sav'd."
We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,
Still passing through the wood; for so I name
Those spirits thick beset.  We were not far
On this side from the summit, when I kenn'd
A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere
Prevailing shin'd.  Yet we a little space
Were distant, not so far but I in part
Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high
That place possess'd.  "O thou, who every art
And science valu'st! who are these, that boast
Such honour, separate from all the rest?"
He answer'd: "The renown of their great names
That echoes through your world above, acquires
Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd."
Meantime a voice I heard: "Honour the bard
Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"
No sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld
Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,
Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
When thus my master kind began: "Mark him,
Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,
The other three preceding, as their lord.
This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:
Flaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;
The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.
Because they all that appellation own,
With which the voice singly accosted me,
Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge."
So I beheld united the bright school
Of him the monarch of sublimest song,
That o'er the others like an eagle soars.
When they together short discourse had held,
They turn'd to me, with salutation kind
Beck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:
Nor was this all; but greater honour still
They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;
And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.
Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd
Speaking of matters, then befitting well
To speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot
Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,
Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round
Defended by a pleasant stream.  O'er this
As o'er dry land we pass'd.  Next through seven gates
I with those sages enter'd, and we came
Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around
Majestically mov'd, and in their port
Bore eminent authority; they spake
Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.
We to one side retir'd, into a place
Open and bright and lofty, whence each one
Stood manifest to view.  Incontinent
There on the green enamel of the plain
Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight
I am exalted in my own esteem.
Electra there I saw accompanied
By many, among whom Hector I knew,
Anchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye
Caesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there
Penthesilea.  On the other side
Old King Latinus, seated by his child
Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,
Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife
Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;
And sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.
Then when a little more I rais'd my brow,
I spied the master of the sapient throng,
Seated amid the philosophic train.
Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence due.
There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,
Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,
Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,
With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,
And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,
Zeno, and Dioscorides well read
In nature's secret lore.  Orpheus I mark'd
And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,
Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,
Galenus, Avicen, and him who made
That commentary vast, Averroes.
Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes
My words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two
The six associates part.  Another way
My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,
Into a climate ever vex'd with storms:
And to a part I come where no light shines.
CANTO V
FROM the first circle I descended thus
Down to the second, which, a lesser space
Embracing, so much more of grief contains
Provoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands
Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all
Who enter, strict examining the crimes,
Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,
According as he foldeth him around:
For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,
It all confesses; and that judge severe
Of sins, considering what place in hell
Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft
Himself encircles, as degrees beneath
He dooms it to descend.  Before him stand
Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn
Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears
His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.
"O thou! who to this residence of woe
Approachest?"  when he saw me coming, cried
Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,
"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom
Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
Deceive thee to thy harm."  To him my guide:
"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way
By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd
Where will and power are one.  Ask thou no more."
Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
Now am I come where many a plaining voice
Smites on mine ear.  Into a place I came
Where light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.
When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,
There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,
And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.
I understood that to this torment sad
The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom
Reason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops
And multitudinous, when winter reigns,
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
On this side and on that, above, below,
It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
Is none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,
Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,
Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld
Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on
By their dire doom.  Then I: "Instructor! who
Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?"--"The first
'Mong those, of whom thou question'st," he replied,
"O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless, that she made
Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,
To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.
This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,
That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;
And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.
The next in amorous fury slew herself,
And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:
Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen."
There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil; there the great
Achilles, who with love fought to the end.
Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside
A thousand more he show'd me, and by name
Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.
When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd
By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind
Was lost; and I began: "Bard! willingly
I would address those two together coming,
Which seem so light before the wind."  He thus:
"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach."
"Then by that love which carries them along,
Entreat; and they will come."  Soon as the wind
Sway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:
"O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse
With us, if by none else restrain'd."  As doves
By fond desire invited, on wide wings
And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,
Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;
Thus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,
They through the ill air speeding; with such force
My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.
"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st
Visiting, through this element obscure,
Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;
If for a friend the King of all we own'd,
Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that
Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,
As now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,
Is situate on the coast, where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.
"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,
Entangled him by that fair form, from me
Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:
Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,
That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.
"Love brought us to one death: Caina waits
The soul, who spilt our life."  Such were their words;
At hearing which downward I bent my looks,
And held them there so long, that the bard cried:
"What art thou pond'ring?"  I in answer thus:
"Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire
Must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!"
Then turning, I to them my speech address'd.
And thus began: "Francesca! your sad fate
Even to tears my grief and pity moves.
But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,
By what, and how love granted, that ye knew
Your yet uncertain wishes?"  She replied:
"No greater grief than to remember days
Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens
Thy learn'd instructor.  Yet so eagerly
If thou art bent to know the primal root,
From whence our love gat being, I will do,
As one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day
For our delight we read of Lancelot,
How him love thrall'd.  Alone we were, and no
Suspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading
Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue
Fled from our alter'd cheek.  But at one point
Alone we fell.  When of that smile we read,
The wished smile, rapturously kiss'd
By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er
From me shall separate, at once my lips
All trembling kiss'd.  The book and writer both
Were love's purveyors.  In its leaves that day
We read no more."  While thus one spirit spake,
The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck
I through compassion fainting, seem'd not far
From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.
CANTO VI
MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd
With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief
O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see
New torments, new tormented souls, which way
Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.
In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs
Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd
For ever, both in kind and in degree.
Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw
Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.
Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,
Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
Over the multitude immers'd beneath.
His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,
His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which
He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs
Piecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,
Under the rainy deluge, with one side
The other screening, oft they roll them round,
A wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm
Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd
His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb
Of him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms
Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth
Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.
E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food
His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall
His fury, bent alone with eager haste
To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks
Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns
The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.
We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt
Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet
Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.
They all along the earth extended lay
Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,
Soon as that way he saw us pass.  "O thou!"
He cried, "who through the infernal shades art led,
Own, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd
Or ere my frame was broken."  I replied:
"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes
Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems
As if I saw thee never.  But inform
Me who thou art, that in a place so sad
Art set, and in such torment, that although
Other be greater, more disgustful none
Can be imagin'd."  He in answer thus:
"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,
Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,
Held me in brighter days.  Ye citizens
Were wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin
Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,
E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;
Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these
Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment."
No more he said, and I my speech resum'd:
"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,
Even to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st,
What shall at length befall the citizens
Of the divided city; whether any just one
Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,
Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?"
He then: "After long striving they will come
To blood; and the wild party from the woods
Will chase the other with much injury forth.
Then it behoves, that this must fall, within
Three solar circles; and the other rise
By borrow'd force of one, who under shore
Now rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof
Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight
The other oppress'd, indignant at the load,
And grieving sore.  The just are two in number,
But they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride,
Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all
On fire."  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;
And I continu'd thus: "Still would I learn
More from thee, farther parley still entreat.
Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,
They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,
Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent
Their minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where
They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.
For I am press'd with keen desire to hear,
If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
Be to their lip assign'd."   He answer'd straight:
"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.
If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.
But to the pleasant world when thou return'st,
Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.
No more I tell thee, answer thee no more."
This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,
A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,
And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.
When thus my guide: "No more his bed he leaves,
Ere the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power
Adverse to these shall then in glory come,
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,
Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,
And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend
The vault."  So pass'd we through that mixture foul
Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile
Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.
For thus I question'd: "Shall these tortures, Sir!
When the great sentence passes, be increas'd,
Or mitigated, or as now severe?"
He then: "Consult thy knowledge; that decides
That as each thing to more perfection grows,
It feels more sensibly both good and pain.
Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive
This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now
They shall approach it."  Compassing that path
Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse
Much more than I relate between us pass'd:
Till at the point, where the steps led below,
Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.
CANTO VII
"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!" loud exclaim'd
Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:
And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,
To comfort me thus spake: "Let not thy fear
Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."
Then to that sworn lip turning, "Peace!"  he cried,
"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself
Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound
Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd
On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd
Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud."
As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;
So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.
Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,
Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe
Hems in of all the universe.  Ah me!
Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st
New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?
E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,
Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,
From one side and the other, with loud voice,
Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,
Then smote together, and each one forthwith
Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,
Exclaiming these, "Why holdest thou so fast?"
Those answering, "And why castest thou away?"
So still repeating their despiteful song,
They to the opposite point on either hand
Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,
Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space
Conflicting met again.  At sight whereof
I, stung with grief, thus spake: "O say, my guide!
What race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,
On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?"
He straight replied: "In their first life these all
In mind were so distorted, that they made,
According to due measure, of their wealth,
No use.  This clearly from their words collect,
Which they howl forth, at each extremity
Arriving of the circle, where their crime
Contrary in kind disparts them.  To the church
Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls
Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom
Av'rice dominion absolute maintains."
I then: "Mid such as these some needs must be,
Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot
Of these foul sins were stain'd."  He answering thus:
"Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life,
Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,
And to all knowledge indiscernible.
Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:
These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,
Those with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,
And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world
Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs
No labour'd phrase of mine to set it off.
Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,
The goods committed into fortune's hands,
For which the human race keep such a coil!
Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,
Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls
Might purchase rest for one."  I thus rejoin'd:
"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;
This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?"
He thus: "O beings blind! what ignorance
Besets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.
He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,
The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers
To guide them, so that each part shines to each,
Their light in equal distribution pour'd.
By similar appointment he ordain'd
Over the world's bright images to rule
Superintendence of a guiding hand
And general minister, which at due time
May change the empty vantages of life
From race to race, from one to other's blood,
Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:
Wherefore one nation rises into sway,
Another languishes, e'en as her will
Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass
The serpent train.  Against her nought avails
Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,
Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs
The other powers divine.  Her changes know
None intermission: by necessity
She is made swift, so frequent come who claim
Succession in her favours.  This is she,
So execrated e'en by those, whose debt
To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
With blame requite her, and with evil word;
But she is blessed, and for that recks not:
Amidst the other primal beings glad
Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.
Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe
Descending: for each star is falling now,
That mounted at our entrance, and forbids
Too long our tarrying."  We the circle cross'd
To the next steep, arriving at a well,
That boiling pours itself down to a foss
Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave
Than sablest grain: and we in company
Of the inky waters, journeying by their side,
Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.
Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands
The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot
Of the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood
To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried
A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks
Betok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone
Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.
The good instructor spake; "Now seest thou, son!
The souls of those, whom anger overcame.
This too for certain know, that underneath
The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs
Into these bubbles make the surface heave,
As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn."
Fix'd in the slime they say: "Sad once were we
In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:
Now in these murky settlings are we sad."
Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.
But word distinct can utter none."  Our route
Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd
Between the dry embankment, and the core
Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes
Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;
Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.
CANTO VIII
MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere
We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes
Its height ascended, where two cressets hung
We mark'd, and from afar another light
Return the signal, so remote, that scarce
The eye could catch its beam.  I turning round
To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:
"Say what this means?  and what that other light
In answer set?  what agency doth this?"
"There on the filthy waters," he replied,
"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,
If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not."
Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,
That ran its way so nimbly through the air,
As a small bark, that through the waves I spied
Toward us coming, under the sole sway
Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:
"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?"--"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,
This time thou criest in vain," my lord replied;
"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er
The slimy pool we pass."  As one who hears
Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat
Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd
In his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd
Into the skiff, and bade me enter next
Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd
The vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd,
Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,
More deeply than with others it is wont.
While we our course o'er the dead channel held.
One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;
"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"
I answer'd: "Though I come, I tarry not;
But who art thou, that art become so foul?"
"One, as thou seest, who mourn:" he straight replied.
To which I thus: "In mourning and in woe,
Curs'd spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,
E'en thus in filth disguis'd."  Then stretch'd he forth
Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage
Aware, thrusting him back: "Away! down there;
"To the other dogs!" then, with his arms my neck
Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: "O soul
Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom
Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one
For arrogance noted; to his memory
No virtue lends its lustre; even so
Here is his shadow furious.  There above
How many now hold themselves mighty kings
Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,
Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!"
I then: "Master! him fain would I behold
Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake."
He thus: "Or ever to thy view the shore
Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,
Which well deserves completion."  Scarce his words
Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes
Set on him with such violence, that yet
For that render I thanks to God and praise
"To Filippo Argenti:" cried they all:
And on himself the moody Florentine
Turn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,
Nor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear
Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,
Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.
And thus the good instructor: "Now, my son!
Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,
With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."
I thus: "The minarets already, Sir!
There certes in the valley I descry,
Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire
Had issu'd."  He replied: "Eternal fire,
That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame
Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest."
We came within the fosses deep, that moat
This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd
As they were fram'd of iron.  We had made
Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud
The mariner cried vehement: "Go forth!
The entrance is here!"  Upon the gates I spied
More than a thousand, who of old from heaven
Were hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, "Who is this,"
They cried, "that without death first felt, goes through
The regions of the dead?"  My sapient guide
Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;
Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus
They spake: "Come thou alone; and let him go
Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.
Alone return he by his witless way;
If well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,
Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark
Hast been his escort." Now bethink thee, reader!
What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.
I did believe I never should return.
"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times
Security hast render'd me, and drawn
From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,
Desert me not," I cried, "in this extreme.
And if our onward going be denied,
Together trace we back our steps with speed."
My liege, who thither had conducted me,
Replied: "Fear not: for of our passage none
Hath power to disappoint us, by such high
Authority permitted.  But do thou
Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd
I will not leave thee in this lower world."
This said, departs the sire benevolent,
And quits me.  Hesitating I remain
At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.
I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,
But they conferr'd not long, for all at once
To trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates
By those our adversaries on the breast
Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd
To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground
His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd
All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:
"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"
Then thus to me: "That I am anger'd, think
No ground of terror: in this trial I
Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within
For hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,
Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,
Which still is without bolt; upon its arch
Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now
On this side of its entrance, down the steep,
Passing the circles, unescorted, comes
One whose strong might can open us this land."
CANTO IX
THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks
Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,
Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,
And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one
Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye
Not far could lead him through the sable air,
And the thick-gath'ring cloud.  "It yet behooves
We win this fight"--thus he began--"if not--
Such aid to us is offer'd.--Oh, how long
Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"
I noted, how the sequel of his words
Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake
Agreed not with the first.  But not the less
My fear was at his saying; sith I drew
To import worse perchance, than that he held,
His mutilated speech.  "Doth ever any
Into this rueful concave's extreme depth
Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain
Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"
Thus I inquiring. "Rarely," he replied,
"It chances, that among us any makes
This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true
Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell
Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades
Back to their bodies.  No long space my flesh
Was naked of me, when within these walls
She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit
From out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place
Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd
Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  The road
Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.
That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round
The city' of grief encompasses, which now
We may not enter without rage."  Yet more
He added: but I hold it not in mind,
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.
Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:
In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;
Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd
Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept
Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.
He knowing well the miserable hags
Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:
"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left
This is Megaera; on the right hand she,
Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone
I' th' midst."  This said, in silence he remain'd
Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves
Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,
That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.
"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant
Him shall we change;" all looking down exclaim'd.
"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took
No ill revenge."  "Turn thyself round, and keep
Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return
Upwards would be for ever lost."  This said,
Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,
Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own
He also hid me.  Ye of intellect
Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd
Under close texture of the mystic strain!
And now there came o'er the perturbed waves
Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made
Either shore tremble, as if of a wind
Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,
That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,
Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls
Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps
Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.
Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: "And now direct
Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,
There, thickest where the smoke ascends." As frogs
Before their foe the serpent, through the wave
Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one
Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits
Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one
Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.
He, from his face removing the gross air,
Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone
By that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd
That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide
Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand
Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full
Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate
He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat
Open without impediment it flew.
"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!"
Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,
"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will
Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft
Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?
What profits at the fays to but the horn?
Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence
Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw."
This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,
And syllable to us spake none, but wore
The semblance of a man by other care
Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him
Who in his presence stands.  Then we our steps
Toward that territory mov'd, secure
After the hallow'd words.  We unoppos'd
There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn
What state a fortress like to that might hold,
I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,
And see on every part wide-stretching space
Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,
Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,
That closes Italy and laves her bounds,
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;
So was it here, save what in horror here
Excell'd: for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,
Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,
That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath
From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,
Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.
I thus: "Master! say who are these, interr'd
Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear
The dolorous sighs?"  He answer thus return'd:
"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied
By every sect their followers; and much more,
Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like
With like is buried; and the monuments
Are different in degrees of heat."  This said,
He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd
Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
CANTO X
NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,
Between the walls, that hem the region round,
And the tormented souls: my master first,
I close behind his steps.  "Virtue supreme!"
I thus began; "who through these ample orbs
In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,
Speak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,
Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?
Already all the lids are rais'd, and none
O'er them keeps watch."  He thus in answer spake
"They shall be closed all, what-time they here
From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring
Their bodies, which above they now have left.
The cemetery on this part obtain
With Epicurus all his followers,
Who with the body make the spirit die.
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,
Which thou conceal'st in silence."  I replied:
"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart
Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself."
"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire
Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!
Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance
Declares the place of thy nativity
To be that noble land, with which perchance
I too severely dealt."  Sudden that sound
Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear
I somewhat closer to my leader's side
Approaching, he thus spake: "What dost thou?  Turn.
Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself
Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all
Expos'd behold him."  On his face was mine
Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there
Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held
E'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,
This warning added: "See thy words be clear!"
He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,
Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood
Address'd me: "Say, what ancestors were thine?"
I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd
The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow
Somewhat uplifting, cried: "Fiercely were they
Adverse to me, my party, and the blood
From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad
Scatter'd them."  "Though driv'n out, yet they each time
From all parts," answer'd I, "return'd; an art
Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn."
Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,
Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,
Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.
It look'd around, as eager to explore
If there were other with me; but perceiving
That fond imagination quench'd, with tears
Thus spake: "If thou through this blind prison go'st.
Led by thy lofty genius and profound,
Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?"
I straight replied: "Not of myself I come,
By him, who there expects me, through this clime
Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son
Had in contempt."  Already had his words
And mode of punishment read me his name,
Whence I so fully answer'd.  He at once
Exclaim'd, up starting, "How! said'st thou he HAD?
No longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye
The blessed daylight?"  Then of some delay
I made ere my reply aware, down fell
Supine, not after forth appear'd he more.
Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom
I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,
Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.
"And if," continuing the first discourse,
"They in this art," he cried, "small skill have shown,
That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.
But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd
Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,
As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,
Against my kin this people is so fell?"
"The slaughter and great havoc," I replied,
"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain--
To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome
Such orisons ascend."  Sighing he shook
The head, then thus resum'd: "In that affray
I stood not singly, nor without just cause
Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;
But singly there I stood, when by consent
Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,
The one who openly forbad the deed."
"So may thy lineage find at last repose,"
I thus adjur'd him, "as thou solve this knot,
Which now involves my mind.  If right I hear,
Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time
Leads with him, of the present uninform'd."
"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,"
He answer'd, "plainly, objects far remote:
So much of his large spendour yet imparts
The Almighty Ruler; but when they approach
Or actually exist, our intellect
Then wholly fails, nor of your human state
Except what others bring us know we aught.
Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all
Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,
When on futurity the portals close."
Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse
Smitten, I added thus: "Now shalt thou say
To him there fallen, that his offspring still
Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,
That if from answer silent I abstain'd,
'Twas that my thought was occupied intent
Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd."
But now my master summoning me back
I heard, and with more eager haste besought
The spirit to inform me, who with him
Partook his lot.  He answer thus return'd:
"More than a thousand with me here are laid
Within is Frederick, second of that name,
And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest
I speak not."  He, this said, from sight withdrew.
But I my steps towards the ancient bard
Reverting, ruminated on the words
Betokening me such ill.  Onward he mov'd,
And thus in going question'd: "Whence the amaze
That holds thy senses wrapt?"  I satisfied
The inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:
"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
To thee importing harm; and note thou this,"
With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,
"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,
Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life
The future tenour will to thee unfold."
Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:
We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space
Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;
Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.
CANTO XI
UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,
By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:
And here to shun the horrible excess
Of fetid exhalation, upward cast
From the profound abyss, behind the lid
Of a great monument we stood retir'd,
Whereon this scroll I mark'd: "I have in charge
Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew
From the right path.--Ere our descent behooves
We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,
To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward
Regard it not."  My master thus; to whom
Answering I spake: "Some compensation find
That the time past not wholly lost."  He then:
"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!
My son! within these rocks," he thus began,
"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,
As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full
Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone
Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how
And for what cause in durance they abide.
"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,
The end is injury; and all such end
Either by force or fraud works other's woe
But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,
To God is more displeasing; and beneath
The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure
Severer pang.  The violent occupy
All the first circle; and because to force
Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds
Each within other sep'rate is it fram'd.
To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man
Force may be offer'd; to himself I say
And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear
At full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds
Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes
By devastation, pillage, and the flames,
His substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites
In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence
The torment undergo of the first round
In different herds.  Man can do violence
To himself and his own blessings: and for this
He in the second round must aye deplore
With unavailing penitence his crime,
Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,
In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.
To God may force be offer'd, in the heart
Denying and blaspheming his high power,
And nature with her kindly law contemning.
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak
Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts.
"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,
May be by man employ'd on one, whose trust
He wins, or on another who withholds
Strict confidence.  Seems as the latter way
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.
Whence in the second circle have their nest
Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,
Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce
To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,
With such vile scum as these.  The other way
Forgets both Nature's general love, and that
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
To special faith.  Whence in the lesser circle,
Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,
The traitor is eternally consum'd."
I thus: "Instructor, clearly thy discourse
Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm
And its inhabitants with skill exact.
But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,
Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,
Wherefore within the city fire-illum'd
Are not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?
And if it be not, wherefore in such guise
Are they condemned?"  He answer thus return'd:
"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,
Not so accustom'd? or what other thoughts
Possess it?  Dwell not in thy memory
The words, wherein thy ethic page describes
Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,
Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,
And how incontinence the least offends
God, and least guilt incurs?  If well thou note
This judgment, and remember who they are,
Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,
Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd
From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours
Justice divine on them its vengeance down."
"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,
Thou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.
Yet somewhat turn thee back," I in these words
Continu'd, "where thou saidst, that usury
Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot
Perplex'd unravel."  He thus made reply:
"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,
Clearly points out, not in one part alone,
How imitative nature takes her course
From the celestial mind and from its art:
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,
Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well
Thou shalt discover, that your art on her
Obsequious follows, as the learner treads
In his instructor's step, so that your art
Deserves the name of second in descent
From God.  These two, if thou recall to mind
Creation's holy book, from the beginning
Were the right source of life and excellence
To human kind.  But in another path
The usurer walks; and Nature in herself
And in her follower thus he sets at nought,
Placing elsewhere his hope.  But follow now
My steps on forward journey bent; for now
The Pisces play with undulating glance
Along the horizon, and the Wain lies all
O'er the north-west; and onward there a space
Is our steep passage down the rocky height."
CANTO XII
THE place where to descend the precipice
We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge
Such object lay, as every eye would shun.
As is that ruin, which Adice's stream
On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,
Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;
For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd
To the low level, so the headlong rock
Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give
To him who from above would pass; e'en such
Into the chasm was that descent: and there
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd
The infamy of Crete, detested brood
Of the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us
It gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.
To him my guide exclaim'd: "Perchance thou deem'st
The King of Athens here, who, in the world
Above, thy death contriv'd.  Monster! avaunt!
He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,
But to behold your torments is he come."
Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring
Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow
Hath struck him, but unable to proceed
Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge
The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:
"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well
That thou descend."  Thus down our road we took
Through those dilapidated crags, that oft
Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs
Unus'd.  I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:
"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,
Guarded by the brute violence, which I
Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst
Hither descended to the nether hell,
This rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt
(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds
Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,
I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,
Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft
Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point,
Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.
But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood
Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,
Who have by violence injur'd."  O blind lust!
O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on
In the brief life, and in the eternal then
Thus miserably o'erwhelm us.  I beheld
An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,
As circling all the plain; for so my guide
Had told.  Between it and the rampart's base
On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,
As to the chase they on the earth were wont.
At seeing us descend they each one stood;
And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows
And missile weapons chosen first; of whom
One cried from far: "Say to what pain ye come
Condemn'd, who down this steep have journied?  Speak
From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw."
To whom my guide: "Our answer shall be made
To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.
Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash."
Then me he touch'd, and spake: "Nessus is this,
Who for the fair Deianira died,
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.
He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;
That other Pholus, prone to wrath."  Around
The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.
We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,
Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,
And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard
To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view
Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:
"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind
Moves what he touches?  The feet of the dead
Are not so wont."  My trusty guide, who now
Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,
Thus made reply: "He is indeed alive,
And solitary so must needs by me
Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd
By strict necessity, not by delight.
She left her joyful harpings in the sky,
Who this new office to my care consign'd.
He is no robber, no dark spirit I.
But by that virtue, which empowers my step
To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,
One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,
Who to the ford may lead us, and convey
Across, him mounted on his back; for he
Is not a spirit that may walk the air."
Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus
To Nessus spake: "Return, and be their guide.
And if ye chance to cross another troop,
Command them keep aloof."  Onward we mov'd,
The faithful escort by our side, along
The border of the crimson-seething flood,
Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.
Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow
Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:
"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given
To blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud
Their merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,
And Dionysius fell, who many a year
Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow
Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,
Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks
Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd
By his foul step-son."  To the bard rever'd
I turned me round, and thus he spake; "Let him
Be to thee now first leader, me but next
To him in rank."  Then farther on a space
The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat
Were extant from the wave; and showing us
A spirit by itself apart retir'd,
Exclaim'd: "He in God's bosom smote the heart,
Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames."
A race I next espied, who held the head,
And even all the bust above the stream.
'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.
Thus shallow more and more the blood became,
So that at last it but imbru'd the feet;
And there our passage lay athwart the foss.
"As ever on this side the boiling wave
Thou seest diminishing," the Centaur said,
"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,
It lower still and lower sinks its bed,
Till in that part it reuniting join,
Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.
There Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand
On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,
On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts
Tears ever by the seething flood unlock'd
From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,
Pazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways
With violence and war."  This said, he turn'd,
And quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.
CANTO XIII
ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,
We enter'd on a forest, where no track
Of steps had worn a way.  Not verdant there
The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light
The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd
And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns
Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,
Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide
Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,
Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.
Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
Broad are their pennons, of the human form
Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen
The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.
The kind instructor in these words began:
"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now
I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come
Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,
As would my speech discredit."  On all sides
I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see
From whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze
Fast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,
And thus his speech resum'd: "If thou lop off
A single twig from one of those ill plants,
The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite."
Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,
From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,
And straight the trunk exclaim'd: "Why pluck'st thou me?"
Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,
These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
Men once were we, that now are rooted here.
Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been
The souls of serpents."  As a brand yet green,
That burning at one end from the other sends
A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind
That forces out its way, so burst at once,
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.
I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one
Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:
"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd
What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,
He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.
But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,
Prompted him to this deed, which even now
Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;
That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,
In the upper world (for thither to return
Is granted him) thy fame he may revive."
"That pleasant word of thine," the trunk replied
"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech
Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge
A little longer, in the snare detain'd,
Count it not grievous.  I it was, who held
Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,
Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,
That besides me, into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find.
The faith I bore to my high charge was such,
It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.
The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes
From Caesar's household, common vice and pest
Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;
And to Augustus they so spread the flame,
That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.
My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought
Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,
Just as I was, unjust toward myself.
By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,
That never faith I broke to my liege lord,
Who merited such honour; and of you,
If any to the world indeed return,
Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies
Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow."
First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words
Were ended, then to me the bard began:
"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,
If more thou wish to learn."  Whence I replied:
"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er
Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power
Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart."
He thus resum'd; "So may he do for thee
Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet
Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,
How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;
And whether any ever from such frame
Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."
Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon
Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;
"Briefly ye shall be answer'd.  When departs
The fierce soul from the body, by itself
Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf
By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,
No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance
Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,
It rises to a sapling, growing thence
A savage plant.  The Harpies, on its leaves
Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain
A vent to grief.  We, as the rest, shall come
For our own spoils, yet not so that with them
We may again be clad; for what a man
Takes from himself it is not just he have.
Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout
The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade."
Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
We stood, expecting farther speech, when us
A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs
Loud rustling round him hears.  And lo! there came
Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,
That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.
"Haste now," the foremost cried, "now haste thee death!"
The other, as seem'd, impatient of delay
Exclaiming, "Lano! not so bent for speed
Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field."
And then, for that perchance no longer breath
Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush
One group he made.  Behind them was the wood
Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,
As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.
On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,
And having rent him piecemeal bore away
The tortur'd limbs.  My guide then seiz'd my hand,
And led me to the thicket, which in vain
Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: "O Giacomo
Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,"
It cried, "that of me thou hast made thy screen?
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?"
When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:
"Say who wast thou, that at so many points
Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?"
He answer'd: "Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time
To spy the shameful havoc, that from me
My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,
And at the foot of their sad parent-tree
Carefully lay them.  In that city' I dwelt,
Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not
On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,
Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls
Upon the ashes left by Attila,
Had labour'd without profit of their toil.
I slung the fatal noose from my own roof."
CANTO XIV
SOON as the charity of native land
Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves
Collected, and to him restor'd, who now
Was hoarse with utt'rance.  To the limit thence
We came, which from the third the second round
Divides, and where of justice is display'd
Contrivance horrible.  Things then first seen
Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next
A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed
Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round
Its garland on all sides, as round the wood
Spreads the sad foss.  There, on the very edge,
Our steps we stay'd.  It was an area wide
Of arid sand and thick, resembling most
The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.
Vengeance of Heav'n!  Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd
By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!
Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,
All weeping piteously, to different laws
Subjected: for on the earth some lay supine,
Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd
Incessantly around; the latter tribe,
More numerous, those fewer who beneath
The torment lay, but louder in their grief.
O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down
Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow
On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.
As in the torrid Indian clime, the son
Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
Descending, solid flames, that to the ground
Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop
To trample on the soil; for easier thus
The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;
So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith
The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove
The viands, doubly to augment the pain.
Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,
Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off
The heat, still falling fresh.  I thus began:
"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,
Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth
To stop our entrance at the gate, say who
Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not
The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,
As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?"
Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd
My guide of him, exclaim'd: "Such as I was
When living, dead such now I am.  If Jove
Weary his workman out, from whom in ire
He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day
Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out
At their black smithy labouring by turns
In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;
"Help, help, good Mulciber!" as erst he cried
In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts
Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge."
Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd
Than I before had heard him: "Capaneus!
Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride
Lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,
Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."
Next turning round to me with milder lip
He spake: "This of the seven kings was one,
Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,
As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,
And sets his high omnipotence at nought.
But, as I told him, his despiteful mood
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.
Follow me now; and look thou set not yet
Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood
Keep ever close."  Silently on we pass'd
To where there gushes from the forest's bound
A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts
My hair with horror.  As the rill, that runs
From Bulicame, to be portion'd out
Among the sinful women; so ran this
Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank
Stone-built, and either margin at its side,
Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.
"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate
We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none
Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,
As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,
O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."
So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,
That having giv'n me appetite to know,
The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.
"In midst of ocean," forthwith he began,
"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,
Under whose monarch in old times the world
Liv'd pure and chaste.  A mountain rises there,
Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,
Deserted now like a forbidden thing.
It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,
Chose for the secret cradle of her son;
And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts
His infant cries.  Within the mount, upright
An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns
His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome
As in his mirror looks.  Of finest gold
His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast
And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.
And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,
Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which
Than on the other more erect he stands,
Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;
And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd
Penetrate to that cave.  They in their course
Thus far precipitated down the rock
Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;
Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence
Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,
Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself
Shall see it) I here give thee no account."
Then I to him: "If from our world this sluice
Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now
Appears it at this edge?"  He straight replied:
"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part
Thou have already pass'd, still to the left
Descending to the nethermost, not yet
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks."
Then I again inquir'd: "Where flow the streams
Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one
Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,
Thou say'st, is form'd."  He answer thus return'd:
"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.
Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd
One thou proposest.  Lethe thou shalt see,
But not within this hollow, in the place,
Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,
Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd."
He added: "Time is now we quit the wood.
Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give
Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;
For over them all vapour is extinct."
CANTO XV
One of the solid margins bears us now
Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream
Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire
Both piers and water.  As the Flemings rear
Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back
The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide
That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs
Along the Brenta, to defend their towns
And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt
On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,
So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these
Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er
He was, that rais'd them here.  We from the wood
Were not so far remov'd, that turning round
I might not have discern'd it, when we met
A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.
They each one ey'd us, as at eventide
One eyes another under a new moon,
And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,
As an old tailor at his needle's eye.
Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,
I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt
Caught me, and cried, "What wonder have we here!"
And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,
Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,
That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not
But I remember'd him; and towards his face
My hand inclining, answer'd: "Sir!  Brunetto!
"And art thou here?"  He thus to me: "My son!
Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto
Latini but a little space with thee
Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed."
I thus to him replied: "Much as I can,
I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,
That I here seat me with thee, I consent;
His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd."
"O son!" said he, "whoever of this throng
One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,
No fan to ventilate him, when the fire
Smites sorest.  Pass thou therefore on.  I close
Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin
My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."
I dar'd not from the path descend to tread
On equal ground with him, but held my head
Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.
"What chance or destiny," thus he began,
"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?
And who is this, that shows to thee the way?"
"There up aloft," I answer'd, "in the life
Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,
Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.
But yester-morn I left it: then once more
Into that vale returning, him I met;
And by this path homeward he leads me back."
"If thou," he answer'd, "follow but thy star,
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:
Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.
And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,
Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I
Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.
But that ungrateful and malignant race,
Who in old times came down from Fesole,
Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,
Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.
Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs
It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.
Old fame reports them in the world for blind,
Covetous, envious, proud.  Look to it well:
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.  For thee
Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,
That thou by either party shalt be crav'd
With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far
From the goat's tooth.  The herd of Fesole
May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,
If any such yet spring on their rank bed,
In which the holy seed revives, transmitted
From those true Romans, who still there remain'd,
When it was made the nest of so much ill."
"Were all my wish fulfill'd," I straight replied,
"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet
Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind
Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart
The dear, benign, paternal image, such
As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me
The way for man to win eternity;
And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,
That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,
What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:
And with another text to comment on
For her I keep it, the celestial dame,
Who will know all, if I to her arrive.
This only would I have thee clearly note:
That so my conscience have no plea against me;
Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.
Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,
The clown his mattock; all things have their course."
Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:
"He listens to good purpose who takes note."
I not the less still on my way proceed,
Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire
Who are most known and chief among his tribe.
"To know of some is well;" thus he replied,
"But of the rest silence may best beseem.
Time would not serve us for report so long.
In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,
Men of great learning and no less renown,
By one same sin polluted in the world.
With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son
Francesco herds among that wretched throng:
And, if the wish of so impure a blotch
Possess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,
Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd
From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where
His ill-strain'd nerves he left.  I more would add,
But must from farther speech and onward way
Alike desist, for yonder I behold
A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.
A company, with whom I may not sort,
Approaches.  I commend my TREASURE to thee,
Wherein I yet survive; my sole request."
This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,
Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed
For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,
Not he who loses but who gains the prize.
CANTO XVI
NOW came I where the water's din was heard,
As down it fell into the other round,
Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:
When forth together issu'd from a troop,
That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,
Three spirits, running swift.  They towards us came,
And each one cried aloud, "Oh do thou stay!
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
To be some inmate of our evil land."
Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,
Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!
E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.
Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,
And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;
"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:
And were 't not for the nature of the place,
Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,
That haste had better suited thee than them."
They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,
And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three
Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.
As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;
Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance
At me directed, so that opposite
The neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.
"If misery of this drear wilderness,"
Thus one began, "added to our sad cheer
And destitute, do call forth scorn on us
And our entreaties, let our great renown
Incline thee to inform us who thou art,
That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd
The soil of Hell.  He, in whose track thou see'st
My steps pursuing, naked though he be
And reft of all, was of more high estate
Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste
Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,
Who in his lifetime many a noble act
Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.
The other, next to me that beats the sand,
Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,
In the upper world, of honour; and myself
Who in this torment do partake with them,
Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife
Of savage temper, more than aught beside
Hath to this evil brought."  If from the fire
I had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight
I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,
Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear
Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,
Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.
I then began: "Not scorn, but grief much more,
Such as long time alone can cure, your doom
Fix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord
Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect
That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.
I am a countryman of yours, who still
Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard
Your deeds and names renown'd.  Leaving the gall
For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide
Hath promis'd to me.  But behooves, that far
As to the centre first I downward tend."
"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,"
He answer straight return'd; "and so thy fame
Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,
If courtesy and valour, as they wont,
Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?
For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,
Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,
Grieves us no little by the news he brings."
"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,
Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee
Engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!"
Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they
All three, who for an answer took my words,
Look'd at each other, as men look when truth
Comes to their ear.  "If thou at other times,"
They all at once rejoin'd, "so easily
Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,
Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,
Returning to behold the radiant stars,
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,
See that of us thou speak among mankind."
This said, they broke the circle, and so swift
Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.
Not in so short a time might one have said
"Amen," as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide
Pursu'd his track.  I follow'd; and small space
Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound
Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce
Heard one another's speech for the loud din.
E'en as the river, that holds on its course
Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,
On the left side of Apennine, toward
The east, which Acquacheta higher up
They call, ere it descend into the vale,
At Forli by that name no longer known,
Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on
From the Alpine summit down a precipice,
Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,
That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,
So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.
I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
The painted leopard.  This when I had all
Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)
I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.
Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink
Standing few paces distant, cast it down
Into the deep abyss.  "And somewhat strange,"
Thus to myself I spake, "signal so strange
Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye
Thus follows."  Ah! what caution must men use
With those who look not at the deed alone,
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!
"Quickly shall come," he said, "what I expect,
Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof
Thy thought is dreaming."  Ever to that truth,
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,
A man, if possible, should bar his lip;
Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.
But silence here were vain; and by these notes
Which now I sing, reader!  I swear to thee,
So may they favour find to latest times!
That through the gross and murky air I spied
A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd
The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise
As one returns, who hath been down to loose
An anchor grappled fast against some rock,
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,
Who upward springing close draws in his feet.
CANTO XVII
"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!
Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls
And firm embattled spears, and with his filth
Taints all the world!"  Thus me my guide address'd,
And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,
Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.
Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,
His head and upper part expos'd on land,
But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,
And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
And orbits.  Colours variegated more
Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
With interchangeable embroidery wove,
Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,
Stands part in water, part upon the land;
Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
The beaver settles watching for his prey;
So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,
Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void
Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,
With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:
"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,
Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."
Thereat toward the right our downward course
We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame
And burning marle, ten paces on the verge
Proceeded.  Soon as we to him arrive,
A little further on mine eye beholds
A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand
Near the wide chasm.  Forthwith my master spake:
"That to the full thy knowledge may extend
Of all this round contains, go now, and mark
The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.
Till thou returnest, I with him meantime
Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe
The aid of his strong shoulders."  Thus alone
Yet forward on the extremity I pac'd
Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe
Were seated.  At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.
Against the vapours and the torrid soil
Alternately their shifting hands they plied.
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore
By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.
Noting the visages of some, who lay
Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,
One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
With colours and with emblems various mark'd,
On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.
And when amongst them looking round I came,
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,
That wore a lion's countenance and port.
Then still my sight pursuing its career,
Another I beheld, than blood more red.
A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
And one, who bore a fat and azure swine
Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:
"What dost thou in this deep?  Go now and know,
Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here
Vitaliano on my left shall sit.
A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming
'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch
With the three beaks will bring!'"  This said, he writh'd
The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox
That licks his nostrils.  I, lest longer stay
He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.
My guide already seated on the haunch
Of the fierce animal I found; and thus
He me encourag'd.  "Be thou stout; be bold.
Down such a steep flight must we now descend!
Mount thou before: for that no power the tail
May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst."
As one, who hath an ague fit so near,
His nails already are turn'd blue, and he
Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.
But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes
The servant bold in presence of his lord.
I settled me upon those shoulders huge,
And would have said, but that the words to aid
My purpose came not, "Look thou clasp me firm!"
But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,
Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,
Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:
"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres
Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.
Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st."
As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,
Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,
And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round
There where the breast had been, his forked tail.
Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,
Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.
Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,
Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;
Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,
By liquefaction of the scalded wax,
The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,
His sire exclaiming loud, "Ill way thou keep'st!"
Than was my dread, when round me on each part
The air I view'd, and other object none
Save the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels
His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,
But that the wind, arising to my face,
Breathes on me from below.  Now on our right
I heard the cataract beneath us leap
With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,
New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:
For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:
So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,
And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,
By the dread torments that on every side
Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.
As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,
But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair
The falconer cries, "Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!"
Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky
In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits
At distance from his lord in angry mood;
So Geryon lighting places us on foot
Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,
And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith
Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.
CANTO XVIII
THERE is a place within the depths of hell
Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd
With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep
That round it circling winds.  Right in the midst
Of that abominable region, yawns
A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame
Due time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,
Throughout its round, between the gulf and base
Of the high craggy banks, successive forms
Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.
As where to guard the walls, full many a foss
Begirds some stately castle, sure defence
Affording to the space within, so here
Were model'd these; and as like fortresses
E'en from their threshold to the brink without,
Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base
Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles
And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,
That in one bound collected cuts them off.
Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves
From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left
Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd.
On our right hand new misery I saw,
New pains, new executioners of wrath,
That swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below
Were naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,
Meeting our faces from the middle point,
With us beyond but with a larger stride.
E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns
Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid
The thronging multitudes, their means devise
For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
All front toward the castle, and approach
Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount.
Each divers way along the grisly rock,
Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,
That on their back unmercifully smote.
Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
None for the second waited nor the third.
Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight
Whom soon as view'd; "Of him," cried I, "not yet
Mine eye hath had his fill."  With fixed gaze
I therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind
Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk
Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,
Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.
But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:
"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,
Unless thy features do belie thee much,
Venedico art thou.  But what brings thee
Into this bitter seas'ning?" He replied:
"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.
But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls
The world I once inhabited, constrains me.
Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola
To do the Marquis' will, however fame
The shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone
Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd
That not so many tongues this day are taught,
Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,
To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.
And if of that securer proof thou need,
Remember but our craving thirst for gold."
Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong
Struck, and exclaim'd, "Away! corrupter! here
Women are none for sale."  Forthwith I join'd
My escort, and few paces thence we came
To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
That easily ascended, to the right
Upon its splinter turning, we depart
From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,
Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
The scourged souls: "Pause here," the teacher said,
"And let these others miserable, now
Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,
For that together they with us have walk'd."
From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came
From th' other side towards us, like the rest,
Excoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,
By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:
"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,
And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
How yet the regal aspect he retains!
Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won
The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
His passage thither led him, when those bold
And pitiless women had slain all their males.
There he with tokens and fair witching words
Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,
Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.
Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.
All bear him company, who like deceit
To his have practis'd.  And thus much to know
Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those
Whom its keen torments urge."  Now had we come
Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path
Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,
Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,
With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves
Smite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf
From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
So hollow is the depth, that from no part,
Save on the summit of the rocky span,
Could I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;
And thence I saw, within the foss below,
A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd
Draff of the human body.  There beneath
Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd
One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,
If he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:
"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,
Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?"
"Because if true my mem'ry," I replied,
"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,
And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more."
Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,
Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue."
My leader thus: "A little further stretch
Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note
Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,
Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,
Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.
"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip
Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,
'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'
And seeing this here satiate be our view."
CANTO XIX
WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,
His wretched followers! who the things of God,
Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,
Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute
For gold and silver in adultery!
Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours
Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault
We now had mounted, where the rock impends
Directly o'er the centre of the foss.
Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,
Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,
And in the evil world, how just a meed
Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides
And in its bottom full of apertures,
All equal in their width, and circular each,
Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd
Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd
Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,
One of the which I brake, some few years past,
To save a whelming infant; and be this
A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth
Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet
And of the legs high upward as the calf
The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot
The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints
Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt
Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,
Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along
The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;
So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.
"Master! say who is he, than all the rest
Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom
A ruddier flame doth prey?"  I thus inquir'd.
"If thou be willing," he replied, "that I
Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs."
I then: "As pleases thee to me is best.
Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit
Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou."
Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,
And on our left descended to the depth,
A narrow strait and perforated close.
Nor from his side my leader set me down,
Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb
Quiv'ring express'd his pang.  "Whoe'er thou art,
Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake
Driv'n in the soil!"  I in these words began,
"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice."
There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive
A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,
Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.
He shouted: "Ha! already standest there?
Already standest there, O Boniface!
By many a year the writing play'd me false.
So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,
For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
The lovely lady, and then mangle her?"
I felt as those who, piercing not the drift
Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd
In mockery, nor know what to reply,
When Virgil thus admonish'd: "Tell him quick,
I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st."
And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.
That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,
And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
"What then of me requirest?  If to know
So much imports thee, who I am, that thou
Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn
That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,
And of a she-bear was indeed the son,
So eager to advance my whelps, that there
My having in my purse above I stow'd,
And here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd
The rest, my predecessors in the guilt
Of simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie
Along an opening in the rock.  'Midst them
I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,
For whom I took thee, when so hastily
I question'd.  But already longer time
Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus
Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand
Planted with fiery feet.  For after him,
One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,
From forth the west, a shepherd without law,
Fated to cover both his form and mine.
He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom
In Maccabees we read; and favour such
As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,
Shall be of France's monarch shown to him."
I know not if I here too far presum'd,
But in this strain I answer'd: "Tell me now,
What treasures from St. Peter at the first
Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys
Into his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more
But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest
Or gold or silver of Matthias took,
When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
Of the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;
Thy punishment of right is merited:
And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,
Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.
If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,
Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet
Severer speech might use.  Your avarice
O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot
Treading the good, and raising bad men up.
Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist
Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,
With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,
She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,
Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
Of gold and silver ye have made your god,
Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,
But he that worships one, a hundred ye?
Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,
Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,
Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!"
Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath
Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang
Spinning on either sole.  I do believe
My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd
A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound
Of the true words I utter'd.  In both arms
He caught, and to his bosom lifting me
Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.
Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,
Till to the summit of the rock we came,
Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd
Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path
Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.
Thence to my view another vale appear'd
CANTO XX
AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,
Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
Of the first song, whose awful theme records
The spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd
Into the depth, that open'd to my view,
Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld
A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,
In silence weeping: such their step as walk
Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
As on them more direct mine eye descends,
Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd
At the neck-bone, so that the countenance
Was from the reins averted: and because
None might before him look, they were compell'd
To' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps
Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,
But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.
Now, reader! think within thyself, so God
Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld
Near me our form distorted in such guise,
That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face
The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock
I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:
"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?
Here pity most doth show herself alive,
When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,
Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?
Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,
Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all
Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?
'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less
Fell ruining far as to Minos down,
Whose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes
The breast his shoulders, and who once too far
Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,
And treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,
Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became
Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then
Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike
The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,
That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again.
"Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes.
On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,
Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,
A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars
And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.
"The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread
Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair
On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd
Through many regions, and at length her seat
Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space
My words detain thy audience.  When her sire
From life departed, and in servitude
The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,
Long time she went a wand'rer through the world.
Aloft in Italy's delightful land
A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,
That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,
Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,
Methinks, and more, water between the vale
Camonica and Garda and the height
Of Apennine remote.  There is a spot
At midway of that lake, where he who bears
Of Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him
Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each
Passing that way his benediction give.
A garrison of goodly site and strong
Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd
The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore
More slope each way descends.  There, whatsoev'er
Benacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er
Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath
Through the green pastures.  Soon as in his course
The steam makes head, Benacus then no more
They call the name, but Mincius, till at last
Reaching Governo into Po he falls.
Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat
It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh
It covers, pestilent in summer oft.
Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw
'Midst of the fen a territory waste
And naked of inhabitants.  To shun
All human converse, here she with her slaves
Plying her arts remain'd, and liv'd, and left
Her body tenantless.  Thenceforth the tribes,
Who round were scatter'd, gath'ring to that place
Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos'd
On all parts by the fen.  On those dead bones
They rear'd themselves a city, for her sake,
Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,
Nor ask'd another omen for the name,
Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,
Ere Casalodi's madness by deceit
Was wrong'd of Pinamonte.  If thou hear
Henceforth another origin assign'd
Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,
That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth."
I answer'd: "Teacher, I conclude thy words
So certain, that all else shall be to me
As embers lacking life.  But now of these,
Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see
Any that merit more especial note.
For thereon is my mind alone intent."
He straight replied: "That spirit, from whose cheek
The beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown, what time
Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce
The cradles were supplied, the seer was he
In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign
When first to cut the cable.  Him they nam'd
Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,
In which majestic measure well thou know'st,
Who know'st it all.  That other, round the loins
So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,
Practis'd in ev'ry slight of magic wile.
"Guido Bonatti see:  Asdente mark,
Who now were willing, he had tended still
The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.
"See next the wretches, who the needle left,
The shuttle and the spindle, and became
Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought
With images and herbs.  But onward now:
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville.  Yesternight
The moon was round.  Thou mayst remember well:
For she good service did thee in the gloom
Of the deep wood."  This said, both onward mov'd.
CANTO XXI
THUS we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,
The which my drama cares not to rehearse,
Pass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood
To view another gap, within the round
Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs.
Marvelous darkness shadow'd o'er the place.
In the Venetians' arsenal as boils
Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear
Their unsound vessels; for th' inclement time
Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while
His bark one builds anew, another stops
The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;
One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;
This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,
The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent
So not by force of fire but art divine
Boil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round
Lim'd all the shore beneath.  I that beheld,
But therein nought distinguish'd, save the surge,
Rais'd by the boiling, in one mighty swell
Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall.  While there
I fix'd my ken below, "Mark! mark!" my guide
Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,
Wherein I stood.  I turn'd myself as one,
Impatient to behold that which beheld
He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,
That he his flight delays not for the view.
Behind me I discern'd a devil black,
That running, up advanc'd along the rock.
Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!
In act how bitter did he seem, with wings
Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!
His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
Was with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch
He held him, the foot's sinew griping fast.
"Ye of our bridge!" he cried, "keen-talon'd fiends!
Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders!  Him
Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.
That land hath store of such.  All men are there,
Except Bonturo, barterers: of 'no'
For lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made."
Him dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd,
Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos'd
Sped with like eager haste.  That other sank
And forthwith writhing to the surface rose.
But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,
Cried "Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here
Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave.
Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,
Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch."  This said,
They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,
And shouted: "Cover'd thou must sport thee here;
So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch."
E'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,
To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.
Me then my guide bespake: "Lest they descry,
That thou art here, behind a craggy rock
Bend low and screen thee; and whate'er of force
Be offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not:
For I am well advis'd, who have been erst
In the like fray."  Beyond the bridge's head
Therewith he pass'd, and reaching the sixth pier,
Behov'd him then a forehead terror-proof.
With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth
Upon the poor man's back, who suddenly
From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd
Those from beneath the arch, and against him
Their weapons all they pointed.  He aloud:
"Be none of you outrageous: ere your time
Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,
"Who having heard my words, decide he then
If he shall tear these limbs."  They shouted loud,
"Go, Malacoda!"  Whereat one advanc'd,
The others standing firm, and as he came,
"What may this turn avail him?" he exclaim'd.
"Believ'st thou, Malacoda!  I had come
Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,"
My teacher answered, "without will divine
And destiny propitious?  Pass we then
For so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead
Another through this savage wilderness."
Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop
The instrument of torture at his feet,
And to the rest exclaim'd: "We have no power
To strike him."  Then to me my guide: "O thou!
Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
Low crouching, safely now to me return."
I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends
Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz'd
Lest they should break the compact they had made.
Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw
Th' infantry dreading, lest his covenant
The foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.
I to my leader's side adher'd, mine eyes
With fixt and motionless observance bent
On their unkindly visage.  They their hooks
Protruding, one the other thus bespake:
"Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?"  To whom
Was answer'd: "Even so; nor miss thy aim."
But he, who was in conf'rence with my guide,
Turn'd rapid round, and thus the demon spake:
"Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!"  Then to us
He added: "Further footing to your step
This rock affords not, shiver'd to the base
Of the sixth arch.  But would you still proceed,
Up by this cavern go: not distant far,
Another rock will yield you passage safe.
Yesterday, later by five hours than now,
Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd
The circuit of their course, since here the way
Was broken.  Thitherward I straight dispatch
Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy
If any on the surface bask.  With them
Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.
Come Alichino forth," with that he cried,
"And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!
The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.
With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,
Fang'd Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,
And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.
Search ye around the bubbling tar.  For these,
In safety lead them, where the other crag
Uninterrupted traverses the dens."
I then: "O master! what a sight is there!
Ah! without escort, journey we alone,
Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.
Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark
How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl
Threatens us present tortures?"  He replied:
"I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,
Gnarl on: 't is but in token of their spite
Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep'd."
To leftward o'er the pier they turn'd; but each
Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,
Toward their leader for a signal looking,
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.
CANTO XXII
IT hath been heretofore my chance to see
Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,
To onset sallying, or in muster rang'd,
Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight;
Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers
Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,
And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,
Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,
Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,
And with inventions multiform, our own,
Or introduc'd from foreign land; but ne'er
To such a strange recorder I beheld,
In evolution moving, horse nor foot,
Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from land or star.
With the ten demons on our way we went;
Ah fearful company! but in the church
With saints, with gluttons at the tavern's mess.
Still earnest on the pitch I gaz'd, to mark
All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those
Who burn'd within.  As dolphins, that, in sign
To mariners, heave high their arched backs,
That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save
Their threaten'd vessels; so, at intervals,
To ease the pain his back some sinner show'd,
Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.
E'en as the frogs, that of a wat'ry moat
Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,
Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,
Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon
As Barbariccia was at hand, so they
Drew back under the wave.  I saw, and yet
My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,
As it befalls that oft one frog remains,
While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,
Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz'd
His clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up,
That he appear'd to me an otter.  Each
Already by their names I knew, so well
When they were chosen, I observ'd, and mark'd
How one the other call'd. "O Rubicant!
See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,"
Shouted together all the cursed crew.
Then I: "Inform thee, master! if thou may,
What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand
His foes have laid."  My leader to his side
Approach'd, and whence he came inquir'd, to whom
Was answer'd thus: "Born in Navarre's domain
My mother plac'd me in a lord's retinue,
For she had borne me to a losel vile,
A spendthrift of his substance and himself.
The good king Thibault after that I serv'd,
To peculating here my thoughts were turn'd,
Whereof I give account in this dire heat."
Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk
Issued on either side, as from a boar,
Ript him with one of these.  'Twixt evil claws
The mouse had fall'n: but Barbariccia cried,
Seizing him with both arms: "Stand thou apart,
While I do fix him on my prong transpierc'd."
Then added, turning to my guide his face,
"Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,
Ere he again be rent."  My leader thus:
"Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;
Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
Under the tar?"--"I parted," he replied,
"But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;
So were I under shelter now with him!
Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more."--.
"Too long we suffer," Libicocco cried,
Then, darting forth a prong, seiz'd on his arm,
And mangled bore away the sinewy part.
Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,
Turning on all sides round, with threat'ning brow
Restrain'd them.  When their strife a little ceas'd,
Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,
My teacher thus without delay inquir'd:
"Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap
Parting, as thou has told, thou cam'st to shore?"--
"It was the friar Gomita," he rejoin'd,
"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,
Who had his master's enemies in hand,
And us'd them so that they commend him well.
Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd.
So he reports: and in each other charge
Committed to his keeping, play'd the part
Of barterer to the height:  with him doth herd
The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.
Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue
Is never weary.  Out! alas! behold
That other, how he grins!  More would I say,
But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore."
Their captain then to Farfarello turning,
Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,
Rebuk'd him thus: "Off! cursed bird!  Avaunt!"--
"If ye desire to see or hear," he thus
Quaking with dread resum'd, "or Tuscan spirits
Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.
Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,
So that no vengeance they may fear from them,
And I, remaining in this self-same place,
Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear,
When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so
Our custom is to call each other up."
Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd,
Then wagg'd the head and spake: "Hear his device,
Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."
Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store
Of nice-wove toils; "Mischief forsooth extreme,
Meant only to procure myself more woe!"
No longer Alichino then refrain'd,
But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:
"If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot
Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat
My plumes.  Quit we the vantage ground, and let
The bank be as a shield, that we may see
If singly thou prevail against us all."
Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!
They each one turn'd his eyes to the other shore,
He first, who was the hardest to persuade.
The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,
Planted his feet on land, and at one leap
Escaping disappointed their resolve.
Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,
Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit
He therefore sped, exclaiming; "Thou art caught."
But little it avail'd: terror outstripp'd
His following flight: the other plung'd beneath,
And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:
E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives
The falcon near, dives instant down, while he
Enrag'd and spent retires.  That mockery
In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew
After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;
And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd
His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke
In grapple close they join'd; but the other prov'd
A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
And in the boiling lake both fell.  The heat
Was umpire soon between them, but in vain
To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued
Their pennons.  Barbariccia, as the rest,
That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd
From the other coast, with all their weapons arm'd.
They, to their post on each side speedily
Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,
Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:
And we departing left them to that broil.
CANTO XXIII
IN silence and in solitude we went,
One first, the other following his steps,
As minor friars journeying on their road.
The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse
Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
For language hath not sounds more like in sense,
Than are these chances, if the origin
And end of each be heedfully compar'd.
And as one thought bursts from another forth,
So afterward from that another sprang,
Which added doubly to my former fear.
For thus I reason'd: "These through us have been
So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,
As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then
Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell
They shall pursue us, than the savage hound
Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."
Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all
On end with terror, and look'd eager back.
"Teacher," I thus began, "if speedily
Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread
Those evil talons.  Even now behind
They urge us: quick imagination works
So forcibly, that I already feel them."
He answer'd: "Were I form'd of leaded glass,
I should not sooner draw unto myself
Thy outward image, than I now imprint
That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts
Presented before mine, with similar act
And count'nance similar, so that from both
I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast
Incline so much, that we may thence descend
Into the other chasm, we shall escape
Secure from this imagined pursuit."
He had not spoke his purpose to the end,
When I from far beheld them with spread wings
Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide
Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep
Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees
The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe
And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him
Than of herself, that but a single vest
Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach
Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,
Which closes on one part the other chasm.
Never ran water with such hurrying pace
Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,
When nearest it approaches to the spokes,
As then along that edge my master ran,
Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,
Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet
Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,
When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear
In him was none; for that high Providence,
Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,
Power of departing thence took from them all.
There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,
Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,
Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.
Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down
Before their eyes, in fashion like to those
Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside
Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,
But leaden all within, and of such weight,
That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.
Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!
We yet once more with them together turn'd
To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.
But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came
The fainting people, that our company
Was chang'd at every movement of the step.
Whence I my guide address'd: "See that thou find
Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,
And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."
Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,
Cried after us aloud: "Hold in your feet,
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."
Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:
"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."
I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look
Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd
To overtake me; but the load they bare
And narrow path retarded their approach.
Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance
Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each
To other thus conferring said: "This one
Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.
And, be they dead, what privilege allows
They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"
Then thus to me: "Tuscan, who visitest
The college of the mourning hypocrites,
Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."
"By Arno's pleasant stream," I thus replied,
"In the great city I was bred and grew,
And wear the body I have ever worn.
but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,
As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"
"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"
One of them answer'd, "are so leaden gross,
That with their weight they make the balances
To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,
Bologna's natives, Catalano I,
He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land
Together taken, as men used to take
A single and indifferent arbiter,
To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,
Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."
"O friars!"  I began, "your miseries--"
But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,
Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout
Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.
And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,
Thus spake: "That pierced spirit, whom intent
Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees
Counsel, that it were fitting for one man
To suffer for the people.  He doth lie
Transverse; nor any passes, but him first
Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
In straits like this along the foss are plac'd
The father of his consort, and the rest
Partakers in that council, seed of ill
And sorrow to the Jews."  I noted then,
How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,
Thus abjectly extended on the cross
In banishment eternal.  To the friar
He next his words address'd: "We pray ye tell,
If so be lawful, whether on our right
Lies any opening in the rock, whereby
We both may issue hence, without constraint
On the dark angels, that compell'd they come
To lead us from this depth."  He thus replied:
"Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock
From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps
Each vale of horror, save that here his cope
Is shatter'd.  By the ruin ye may mount:
For on the side it slants, and most the height
Rises below."  With head bent down awhile
My leader stood, then spake: "He warn'd us ill,
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."
To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
"I many vices of the devil heard,
Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,
And the father of lies!'"  When he had spoke,
My leader with large strides proceeded on,
Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.
I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,
And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd.
CANTO XXIV
IN the year's early nonage, when the sun
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,
And now towards equal day the nights recede,
When as the rime upon the earth puts on
Her dazzling sister's image, but not long
Her milder sway endures, then riseth up
The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,
And looking out beholds the plain around
All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites
His thighs, and to his hut returning in,
There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,
As a discomfited and helpless man;
Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope
Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon
The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,
And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw
His troubled forehead, and so speedily
That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge
Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,
He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld
At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well
The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd
With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm
And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,
Computes his labour's issue, that he seems
Still to foresee the effect, so lifting me
Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd
His eye upon another.  "Grapple that,"
Said he, "but first make proof, if it be such
As will sustain thee."  For one capp'd with lead
This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,
And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,
Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast
Were not less ample than the last, for him
I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd.
But Malebolge all toward the mouth
Inclining of the nethermost abyss,
The site of every valley hence requires,
That one side upward slope, the other fall.
At length the point of our descent we reach'd
From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,
So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,
I could no further, but did seat me there.
"Now needs thy best of man;" so spake my guide:
"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade
Of canopy reposing, fame is won,
Without which whosoe'er consumes his days
Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd
To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.
If well thou note me, profit by my words."
I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent
Than I in truth did feel me.  "On," I cried,
"For I am stout and fearless."  Up the rock
Our way we held, more rugged than before,
Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk
I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem
Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.
Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,
What were the words I knew not, but who spake
Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,
And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
I hear and understand not, so I see
Beneath, and naught discern."--"I answer not,"
Said he, "but by the deed.  To fair request
Silent performance maketh best return."
We from the bridge's head descended, where
To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm
Opening to view, I saw a crowd within
Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape
And hideous, that remembrance in my veins
Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands
Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,
Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,
Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire
Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,
Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er
Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.
Amid this dread exuberance of woe
Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
With serpents were their hands behind them bound,
Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head
Twisted in folds before.  And lo! on one
Near to our side, darted an adder up,
And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,
Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen
Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd
To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth.
When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again
Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form
Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,
The Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years
Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith
Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life
He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone
And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,
He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd
To earth, or through obstruction fettering up
In chains invisible the powers of man,
Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,
Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony
He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;
So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out
Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was
My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few
He answer'd: "Vanni Fucci am I call'd,
Not long since rained down from Tuscany
To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life
And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,
Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."
I then to Virgil: "Bid him stir not hence,
And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
A man I knew him choleric and bloody."
The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me
His mind directing and his face, wherein
Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:
"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than
When I was taken from the other life.
I have no power permitted to deny
What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low
To dwell, for that the sacristy by me
Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,
And with the guilt another falsely charged.
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,
So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,
A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,
And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike
Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."
CANTO XXV
WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands
Pointed in mockery, and cried: "Take them, God!
I level them at thee!"  From that day forth
The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
One of then rolling twisted, as it said,
"Be silent, tongue!"  Another to his arms
Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself
So close, it took from them the power to move.
Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth
No longer, since in evil act so far
Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,
Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss,
Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,
Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,
Nor utter'd more; and after him there came
A centaur full of fury, shouting, "Where
Where is the caitiff?"  On Maremma's marsh
Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch
They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,
With open wings, a dragon breathing fire
On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:
"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock
Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
He, from his brethren parted, here must tread
A different journey, for his fraudful theft
Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found
His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace
Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on
A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."
While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:
And under us three spirits came, of whom
Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;
"Say who are ye?"  We then brake off discourse,
Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;
But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one
Had need to name another.  "Where," said he,
"Doth Cianfa lurk?"  I, for a sign my guide
Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips
The finger lifted.  If, O reader! now
Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,
No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked
Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet
Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:
His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot
Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek
He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd
Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd
A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs
The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.
Then, as they both had been of burning wax,
Each melted into other, mingling hues,
That which was either now was seen no more.
Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,
A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,
And the clean white expires.  The other two
Look'd on exclaiming: "Ah, how dost thou change,
Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,
"Nor only one."  The two heads now became
One, and two figures blended in one form
Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths
Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,
As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape
All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd
That image miscreate, and so pass'd on
With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge
Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,
Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems
A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,
So toward th' entrails of the other two
Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,
As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.
In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,
One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell
Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him
But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,
As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.
He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him.
One from the wound, the other from the mouth
Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd.
Lucan in mute attention now may hear,
Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,
Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute.
What if in warbling fiction he record
Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake
Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,
I envy not; for never face to face
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,
Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
The other's substance.  They in mutual guise
So answer'd, that the serpent split his train
Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit
Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs
Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon
Was visible: the tail disparted took
The figure which the spirit lost, its skin
Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind.
The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd
The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet
So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk.
The feet behind then twisting up became
That part that man conceals, which in the wretch
Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke
With a new colour veils, and generates
Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off
From th' other body, lo! upon his feet
One upright rose, and prone the other fell.
Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath.
Of him who stood erect, the mounting face
Retreated towards the temples, and what there
Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears
From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,
Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd
Into due size protuberant the lips.
He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends
His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears
Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.
His tongue continuous before and apt
For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork
Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.
The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,
Hissing along the vale, and after him
The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd
His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few
Thus to another spake: "Along this path
Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"
So saw I fluctuate in successive change
Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events
So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes
Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.
Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well
I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was
Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,
The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue.
CANTO XXVI
FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily
Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings
Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!
Among the plund'rers such the three I found
Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,
And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,
Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long
Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)
Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
Were in good time, if it befell thee now.
Would so it were, since it must needs befall!
For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.
We from the depth departed; and my guide
Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late
We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep.
Pursuing thus our solitary way
Among the crags and splinters of the rock,
Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,
As my thought turns again to what I saw,
And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb
The powers of nature in me, lest they run
Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
My gentle star, or something better gave me,
I envy not myself the precious boon.
As in that season, when the sun least veils
His face that lightens all, what time the fly
Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then
Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees
Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,
Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:
With flames so numberless throughout its space
Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth
Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs
The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw
Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect
Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,
Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone
Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,
A sinner so enfolded close in each,
That none exhibits token of the theft.
Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,
And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,
Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark'd
How I did gaze attentive, thus began:
"Within these ardours are the spirits, each
Swath'd in confining fire."--"Master, thy word,"
I answer'd, "hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd
Already of the truth, already wish'd
To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes
So parted at the summit, as it seem'd
Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay
The Theban brothers?"  He replied: "Within
Ulysses there and Diomede endure
Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now
Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.
These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide
A portal for that goodly seed to pass,
Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile
Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft
Deidamia yet in death complains.
And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy
Of her Palladium spoil'd."--"If they have power
Of utt'rance from within these sparks," said I,
"O master! think my prayer a thousand fold
In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe
To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.
See, how toward it with desire I bend."
He thus: "Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,
And I accept it therefore: but do thou
Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,
For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,
For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."
When there the flame had come, where time and place
Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:
"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!
If living I of you did merit aught,
Whate'er the measure were of that desert,
When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,
Move ye not on, till one of you unfold
In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."
Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire
That labours with the wind, then to and fro
Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,
Threw out its voice, and spake: "When I escap'd
From Circe, who beyond a circling year
Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,
Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,
Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
Of my old father, nor return of love,
That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,
Could overcome in me the zeal I had
T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,
Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd
Into the deep illimitable main,
With but one bark, and the small faithful band
That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,
Far as Morocco either shore I saw,
And the Sardinian and each isle beside
Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age
Were I and my companions, when we came
To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd
The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.
The walls of Seville to my right I left,
On the other hand already Ceuta past.
"O brothers!"  I began, "who to the west
Through perils without number now have reach'd,
To this the short remaining watch, that yet
Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof
Of the unpeopled world, following the track
Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage
The mind of my associates, that I then
Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn
Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight
Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.
Each star of the other pole night now beheld,
And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor
It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft
Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon
Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far
Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought
Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,
But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land
A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side
Did strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl'd her round
With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up
The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:
And over us the booming billow clos'd."
CANTO XVII
NOW upward rose the flame, and still'd its light
To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave
From the mild poet gain'd, when following came
Another, from whose top a sound confus'd,
Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.
As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully
His cries first echoed, who had shap'd its mould,
Did so rebellow, with the voice of him
Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd
Pierc'd through with pain; thus while no way they found
Nor avenue immediate through the flame,
Into its language turn'd the dismal words:
But soon as they had won their passage forth,
Up from the point, which vibrating obey'd
Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:
"O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,
"Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,
And with me parley: lo! it irks not me
And yet I burn.  If but e'en now thou fall
into this blind world, from that pleasant land
Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,
Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,
Have peace or war.  For of the mountains there
Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,
Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood."
Leaning I listen'd yet with heedful ear,
When, as he touch'd my side, the leader thus:
"Speak thou: he is a Latian."  My reply
Was ready, and I spake without delay:
"O spirit! who art hidden here below!
Never was thy Romagna without war
In her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now:
But open war there left I none.  The state,
Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,
Is steadfast.  There Polenta's eagle broods,
And in his broad circumference of plume
O'ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp
The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,
And pil'd in bloody heap the host of France.
"The old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,
That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,
Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.
"Lamone's city and Santerno's range
Under the lion of the snowy lair.
Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,
Or ever summer yields to winter's frost.
And she, whose flank is wash'd of Savio's wave,
As 'twixt the level and the steep she lies,
Lives so 'twixt tyrant power and liberty.
"Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?
Be not more hard than others.  In the world,
So may thy name still rear its forehead high."
Then roar'd awhile the fire, its sharpen'd point
On either side wav'd, and thus breath'd at last:
"If I did think, my answer were to one,
Who ever could return unto the world,
This flame should rest unshaken.  But since ne'er,
If true be told me, any from this depth
Has found his upward way, I answer thee,
Nor fear lest infamy record the words.
"A man of arms at first, I cloth'd me then
In good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so
T' have made amends.  And certainly my hope
Had fail'd not, but that he, whom curses light on,
The high priest again seduc'd me into sin.
And how and wherefore listen while I tell.
Long as this spirit mov'd the bones and pulp
My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake
The nature of the lion than the fox.
All ways of winding subtlety I knew,
And with such art conducted, that the sound
Reach'd the world's limit.  Soon as to that part
Of life I found me come, when each behoves
To lower sails and gather in the lines;
That which before had pleased me then I rued,
And to repentance and confession turn'd;
Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,
Waging his warfare near the Lateran,
Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes
All Christians were, nor against Acre one
Had fought, nor traffic'd in the Soldan's land),
He his great charge nor sacred ministry
In himself, rev'renc'd, nor in me that cord,
Which us'd to mark with leanness whom it girded.
As in Socrate, Constantine besought
To cure his leprosy Sylvester's aid,
So me to cure the fever of his pride
This man besought: my counsel to that end
He ask'd: and I was silent: for his words
Seem'd drunken: but forthwith he thus resum'd:
'From thy heart banish fear: of all offence
I hitherto absolve thee.  In return,
Teach me my purpose so to execute,
That Penestrino cumber earth no more.
Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut
And open: and the keys are therefore twain,
The which my predecessor meanly priz'd.'"
Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,
Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,
And answer'd: "Father! since thou washest me
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,
Large promise with performance scant, be sure,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."
"When I was number'd with the dead, then came
Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark
He met, who cried: 'Wrong me not; he is mine,
And must below to join the wretched crew,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave.
E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,
No power can the impenitent absolve;
Nor to repent and will at once consist,
By contradiction absolute forbid.'"
Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he
Seiz'd me, and cried, "Thou haply thought'st me not
A disputant in logic so exact."
To Minos down he bore me, and the judge
Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,
Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:
"This is a guilty soul, that in the fire
Must vanish.  Hence perdition-doom'd I rove
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb."
When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame
In dolour parted, beating to and fro,
And writhing its sharp horn.  We onward went,
I and my leader, up along the rock,
Far as another arch, that overhangs
The foss, wherein the penalty is paid
Of those, who load them with committed sin.
CANTO XXVIII
WHO, e'en in words unfetter'd, might at full
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,
Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue
So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought
Both impotent alike.  If in one band
Collected, stood the people all, who e'er
Pour'd on Apulia's happy soil their blood,
Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war
When of the rings the measur'd booty made
A pile so high, as Rome's historian writes
Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt
The grinding force of Guiscard's Norman steel,
And those the rest, whose bones are gather'd yet
At Ceperano, there where treachery
Branded th' Apulian name, or where beyond
Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms
The old Alardo conquer'd; and his limbs
One were to show transpierc'd, another his
Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this
Were but a thing of nought, to the hideous sight
Of the ninth chasm.  A rundlet, that hath lost
Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,
As one I mark'd, torn from the chin throughout
Down to the hinder passage: 'twixt the legs
Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay
Open to view, and wretched ventricle,
That turns th' englutted aliment to dross.
Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,
He ey'd me, with his hands laid his breast bare,
And cried; "Now mark how I do rip me! lo!
"How is Mohammed mangled! before me
Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face
Cleft to the forelock; and the others all
Whom here thou seest, while they liv'd, did sow
Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.
A fiend is here behind, who with his sword
Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again
Each of this ream, when we have compast round
The dismal way, for first our gashes close
Ere we repass before him.  But say who
Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,
Haply so lingering to delay the pain
Sentenc'd upon thy crimes?"--"Him death not yet,"
My guide rejoin'd, "hath overta'en, nor sin
Conducts to torment; but, that he may make
Full trial of your state, I who am dead
Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,
Conduct him.  Trust my words, for they are true."
More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,
Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,
Forgetful of their pangs.  "Thou, who perchance
Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou
Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not
Here soon to follow me, that with good store
Of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows
Yield him a victim to Novara's power,
No easy conquest else."  With foot uprais'd
For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground
Then fix'd it to depart.  Another shade,
Pierc'd in the throat, his nostrils mutilate
E'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear
Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood
Gazing, before the rest advanc'd, and bar'd
His wind-pipe, that without was all o'ersmear'd
With crimson stain.  "O thou!" said he, "whom sin
Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near
Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft
Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind
Piero of Medicina, if again
Returning, thou behold'st the pleasant land
That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;
"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts
Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,
That if 't is giv'n us here to scan aright
The future, they out of life's tenement
Shall be cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves
Near to Cattolica, through perfidy
Of a fell tyrant.  'Twixt the Cyprian isle
And Balearic, ne'er hath Neptune seen
An injury so foul, by pirates done
Or Argive crew of old.  That one-ey'd traitor
(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
His eye had still lack'd sight of) them shall bring
To conf'rence with him, then so shape his end,
That they shall need not 'gainst Focara's wind
Offer up vow nor pray'r."  I answering thus:
"Declare, as thou dost wish that I above
May carry tidings of thee, who is he,
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?"
Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone
Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws
Expanding, cried: "Lo! this is he I wot of;
He speaks not for himself: the outcast this
Who overwhelm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind,
Affirming that delay to men prepar'd
Was ever harmful."  Oh  how terrified
Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut
The tongue, which spake that hardy word.  Then one
Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom
The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots
Sullied his face, and cried: "'Remember thee
Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim'd,
'The deed once done there is an end,' that prov'd
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race."
I added: "Ay, and death to thine own tribe."
Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,
As one grief-stung to madness.  But I there
Still linger'd to behold the troop, and saw
Things, such as I may fear without more proof
To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,
The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate
Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within
And bids him on and fear not.  Without doubt
I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,
A headless trunk, that even as the rest
Of the sad flock pac'd onward.  By the hair
It bore the sever'd member, lantern-wise
Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,
"Woe's me!"  The spirit lighted thus himself,
And two there were in one, and one in two.
How that may be he knows who ordereth so.
When at the bridge's foot direct he stood,
His arm aloft he rear'd, thrusting the head
Full in our view, that nearer we might hear
The words, which thus it utter'd: "Now behold
This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st
To spy the dead; behold if any else
Be terrible as this.  And that on earth
Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I
Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John
The counsel mischievous.  Father and son
I set at mutual war.  For Absalom
And David more did not Ahitophel,
Spurring them on maliciously to strife.
For parting those so closely knit, my brain
Parted, alas!  I carry from its source,
That in this trunk inhabits.  Thus the law
Of retribution fiercely works in me."
CANTO XXIX
SO were mine eyes inebriate with view
Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds
Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.
But Virgil rous'd me: "What yet gazest on?
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
Among the maim'd and miserable shades?
Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
This weakness.  Know, if thou wouldst number them
That two and twenty miles the valley winds
Its circuit, and already is the moon
Beneath our feet: the time permitted now
Is short, and more not seen remains to see."
"If thou," I straight replied, "hadst weigh'd the cause
For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd
The tarrying still."  My leader part pursu'd
His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,
And adding thus: "Within that cave I deem,
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,
There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,
Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear."
Then spake my master: "Let thy soul no more
Afflict itself for him.  Direct elsewhere
Its thought, and leave him.  At the bridge's foot
I mark'd how he did point with menacing look
At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd
Geri of Bello.  Thou so wholly then
Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd
The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not
That way, ere he was gone."--"O guide belov'd!
His violent death yet unaveng'd," said I,
"By any, who are partners in his shame,
Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,
He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so
Hath made me more compassionate his fate."
So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd
The other valley, had more light been there,
E'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came
O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood
Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart
Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all
With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd
Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
As were the torment, if each lazar-house
Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time
'Twixt July and September, with the isle
Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,
Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss
Together; such was here the torment: dire
The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs.
We on the utmost shore of the long rock
Descended still to leftward.  Then my sight
Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein
The minister of the most mighty Lord,
All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment
The forgers noted on her dread record.
More rueful was it not methinks to see
The nation in Aegina droop, what time
Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,
All fell, so full of malice was the air
(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,
The ancient people were restor'd anew
From seed of emmets) than was here to see
The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale
Up-pil'd on many a stack.  Confus'd they lay,
One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one
Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third
Along the dismal pathway.  Step by step
We journey'd on, in silence looking round
And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain
To lift their forms.  Then two I mark'd, that sat
Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans
Set to retain the heat.  From head to foot,
A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er
Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord
Impatient waited, or himself perchance
Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one
Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness
Of ne'er abated pruriency.  The crust
Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales
Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.
"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off
Thy coat of proof," thus spake my guide to one,
"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,
Tell me if any born of Latian land
Be among these within: so may thy nails
Serve thee for everlasting to this toil."
"Both are of Latium," weeping he replied,
"Whom tortur'd thus thou seest: but who art thou
That hast inquir'd of us?"  To whom my guide:
"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,
From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss."
Then started they asunder, and each turn'd
Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear
Those words redounding struck.  To me my liege
Address'd him: "Speak to them whate'er thou list."
And I therewith began: "So may no time
Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
In th' upper world, but after many suns
Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,
And of what race ye come.  Your punishment,
Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,
Deter you not from opening thus much to me."
"Arezzo was my dwelling," answer'd one,
"And me Albero of Sienna brought
To die by fire; but that, for which I died,
Leads me not here.  True is in sport I told him,
That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.
And he admiring much, as he was void
Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him
The secret of mine art: and only hence,
Because I made him not a Daedalus,
Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,
For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,
Has doom'd me.  Him no subterfuge eludes."
Then to the bard I spake: "Was ever race
Light as Sienna's?  Sure not France herself
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain."
The other leprous spirit heard my words,
And thus return'd: "Be Stricca from this charge
Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately
To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo
Who first the spice's costly luxury
Discover'd in that garden, where such seed
Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop
Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano
Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,
And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd
A spectacle for all.  That thou mayst know
Who seconds thee against the Siennese
Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,
That well my face may answer to thy ken;
So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,
Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power
Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,
Thus needs must well remember how I aped
Creative nature by my subtle art."
CANTO XXX
WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast
For Semele against the Theban blood,
As more than once in dire mischance was rued,
Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,
That he his spouse beholding with a babe
Laden on either arm, "Spread out," he cried,
"The meshes, that I take the lioness
And the young lions at the pass:" then forth
Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,
One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,
Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,
And with her other burden self-destroy'd
The hapless mother plung'd: and when the pride
Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,
By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king
With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,
A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw
Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,
Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach
Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense
Did she run barking even as a dog;
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.
Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads
Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine
Excluded from his stye.  One reach'd Capocchio,
And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,
Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd
His belly stretch'd out prone.  The other shape,
He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;
"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood
Of random mischief vents he still his spite."
To whom I answ'ring: "Oh! as thou dost hope,
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,
Be patient to inform us, who it is,
Ere it speed hence."--"That is the ancient soul
Of wretched Myrrha," he replied, "who burn'd
With most unholy flame for her own sire,
"And a false shape assuming, so perform'd
The deed of sin; e'en as the other there,
That onward passes, dar'd to counterfeit
Donati's features, to feign'd testament
The seal affixing, that himself might gain,
For his own share, the lady of the herd."
When vanish'd the two furious shades, on whom
Mine eye was held, I turn'd it back to view
The other cursed spirits.  One I saw
In fashion like a lute, had but the groin
Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part.
Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs
With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch
Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips
Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,
One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd.
"O ye, who in this world of misery,
Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,"
Thus he began, "attentively regard
Adamo's woe.  When living, full supply
Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;
One drop of water now, alas!  I crave.
The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes
Of Casentino, making fresh and soft
The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,
Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;
For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,
Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh
Desert these shrivel'd cheeks.  So from the place,
Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,
Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.
There is Romena, where I falsified
The metal with the Baptist's form imprest,
For which on earth I left my body burnt.
But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,
For Branda's limpid spring I would not change
The welcome sight.  One is e'en now within,
If truly the mad spirits tell, that round
Are wand'ring.  But wherein besteads me that?
My limbs are fetter'd.  Were I but so light,
That I each hundred years might move one inch,
I had set forth already on this path,
Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,
Although eleven miles it wind, not more
Than half of one across.  They brought me down
Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd
The florens with three carats of alloy."
"Who are that abject pair," I next inquir'd,
"That closely bounding thee upon thy right
Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd
In the chill stream?"--"When to this gulf I dropt,"
He answer'd, "here I found them; since that hour
They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,
Till time hath run his course.  One is that dame
The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;
Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.
Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,
In such a cloud upsteam'd."  When that he heard,
One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,
With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,
That like a drum resounded: but forthwith
Adamo smote him on the face, the blow
Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.
"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me
The power to move," said he, "I have an arm
At liberty for such employ."  To whom
Was answer'd: "When thou wentest to the fire,
Thou hadst it not so ready at command,
Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold."
And thus the dropsied: "Ay, now speak'st thou true.
But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,
When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."
"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,"
Said Sinon; "I am here but for one fault,
And thou for more than any imp beside."
"Remember," he replied, "O perjur'd one,
The horse remember, that did teem with death,
And all the world be witness to thy guilt."
"To thine," return'd the Greek, "witness the thirst
Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,
Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,
A mass corrupt."  To whom the coiner thus:
"Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
Its evil saying.  Me if thirst assails,
Yet I am stuff'd with moisture.  Thou art parch'd,
Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need
To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up."
I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide
Admonish'd: "Now beware: a little more,
And I do quarrel with thee."  I perceiv'd
How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd
With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet
Confounds me.  As a man that dreams of harm
Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,
And that which is, desires as if it were not,
Such then was I, who wanting power to speak
Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while
Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.
"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,"
My master cried, "might expiate.  Therefore cast
All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,
Think I am ever at thy side.  To hear
Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds."
CANTO XXXI
THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before
Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,
Now minister'd my cure.  So have I heard,
Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd
Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd.
Turning our back upon the vale of woe,
W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence.  There
Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom
Mine eye advanc'd not: but I heard a horn
Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made
The thunder feeble.  Following its course
The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent
On that one spot.  So terrible a blast
Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout
O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd
His saintly warfare.  Thitherward not long
My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers
Methought I spied.  "Master," said I, "what land
Is this?"  He answer'd straight: "Too long a space
Of intervening darkness has thine eye
To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd
In thy imagining.  Thither arriv'd
Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude
The sense.  A little therefore urge thee on."
Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;
"Yet know," said he, "ere farther we advance,
That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,
But giants.  In the pit they stand immers'd,
Each from his navel downward, round the bank."
As when a fog disperseth gradually,
Our vision traces what the mist involves
Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross
And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more
We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,
And fear came o'er me.  As with circling round
Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,
E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,
Was turreted with giants, half their length
Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n
Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.
Of one already I descried the face,
Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge
Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.
All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand
Left framing of these monsters, did display
Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War
Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she
Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,
Who ponders well confesses her therein
Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force
And evil will are back'd with subtlety,
Resistance none avails.  His visage seem'd
In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops
Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones
Of like proportion, so that from above
The bank, which girdled him below, such height
Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders
Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.
Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd
Downward from whence a man his garments loops.
"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,"
So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns
Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:
"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee
Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage
Or other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast
Where hangs the baldrick!"  Then to me he spake:
"He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
One tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste
Our words; for so each language is to him,
As his to others, understood by none."
Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,
And at a sling's throw found another shade
Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say
What master hand had girt him; but he held
Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before
The other with a chain, that fasten'd him
From the neck down, and five times round his form
Apparent met the wreathed links.  "This proud one
Would of his strength against almighty Jove
Make trial," said my guide; "whence he is thus
Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought
Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,
Now moves he never."  Forthwith I return'd:
"Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes
Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd
Experience next."  He answer'd: "Thou shalt see
Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks
And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there
Where guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands
Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made
Like to this spirit, save that in his looks
More fell he seems."  By violent earthquake rock'd
Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,
As Ephialtes.  More than ever then
I dreaded death, nor than the terror more
Had needed, if I had not seen the cords
That held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,
Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete
Without the head, forth issued from the cave.
"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made
Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword
Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,
Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm
The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe
To place us down beneath, where numbing cold
Locks up Cocytus.  Force not that we crave
Or Tityus' help or Typhon's.  Here is one
Can give what in this realm ye covet.  Stoop
Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.
He in the upper world can yet bestow
Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks
For life yet longer, if before the time
Grace call him not unto herself."  Thus spake
The teacher.  He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,
And caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt
That grapple straighten'd score.  Soon as my guide
Had felt it, he bespake me thus: "This way
That I may clasp thee;" then so caught me up,
That we were both one burden.  As appears
The tower of Carisenda, from beneath
Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud
So sail across, that opposite it hangs,
Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease
I mark'd him stooping.  I were fain at times
T' have pass'd another way.  Yet in th' abyss,
That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,
Lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,
But rose as in a bark the stately mast.
CANTO XXXII
COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit
That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock
His firm abutment rears, then might the vein
Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch
The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
Of all the universe, is no emprize
To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd
To infant babbling.  But let them assist
My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid
Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the truth
My speech shall best accord.  Oh ill-starr'd folk,
Beyond all others wretched! who abide
In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words
To speak of, better had ye here on earth
Been flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood
In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,
But lower far than they, and I did gaze
Still on the lofty battlement, a voice
Bespoke me thus: "Look how thou walkest.  Take
Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads
Of thy poor brethren."  Thereupon I turn'd,
And saw before and underneath my feet
A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd
To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil
In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread
O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote
Under the chilling sky.  Roll'd o'er that mass
Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,
Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog
Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams
The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,
So, to where modest shame appears, thus low
Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,
Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,
Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.
A space I look'd around, then at my feet
Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head
The very hairs were mingled.  "Tell me ye,
Whose bosoms thus together press," said I,
"Who are ye?"  At that sound their necks they bent,
And when their looks were lifted up to me,
Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,
Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound
The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up
So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats
They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.
And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,
Exclaim'd, still looking downward: "Why on us
Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know
Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave
Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own
Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.
They from one body issued; and throughout
Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade
More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,
Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land
At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,
No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head
Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,
Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
All further question, in my form behold
What once was Camiccione.  I await
Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt
Shall wash out mine."  A thousand visages
Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold
Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps
A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought
Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on
Toward the middle, at whose point unites
All heavy substance, and I trembling went
Through that eternal chillness, I know not
If will it were or destiny, or chance,
But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike
With violent blow against the face of one.
"Wherefore dost bruise me?" weeping, he exclaim'd,
"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"
I thus: "Instructor, now await me here,
That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt."  The teacher paus'd,
And to that shade I spake, who bitterly
Still curs'd me in his wrath.  "What art thou, speak,
That railest thus on others?"  He replied:
"Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks
Through Antenora roamest, with such force
As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"
"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"
Was my reply, "if fame be dear to thee,
That with the rest I may thy name enrol."
"The contrary of what I covet most,"
Said he, "thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more.
Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."
Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:
"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."
"Rend all away," he answer'd, "yet for that
I will not tell nor show thee who I am,
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."
Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off
More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes
Drawn in and downward, when another cried,
"What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough
Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?
What devil wrings thee?"--"Now," said I, "be dumb,
Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
True tidings will I bear."--"Off," he replied,
"Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,
Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.
'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,
Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd
What other shade was with them, at thy side
Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd
The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,
If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,
With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him
Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."
We now had left him, passing on our way,
When I beheld two spirits by the ice
Pent in one hollow, that the head of one
Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost
Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,
Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously
On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,
Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
"O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate
'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear," said I
"The cause, on such condition, that if right
Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,
And what the colour of his sinning was,
I may repay thee in the world above,
If that wherewith I speak be moist so long."
CANTO XXXIII
HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,
That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,
Which he behind had mangled, then began:
"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh
Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings
My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,
That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear
Fruit of eternal infamy to him,
The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once
Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be
I know not, nor how here below art come:
But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,
When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth
Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he
Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,
Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts
In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en
And after murder'd, need is not I tell.
What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,
How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,
And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate
Within that mew, which for my sake the name
Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,
Already through its opening sev'ral moons
Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,
That from the future tore the curtain off.
This one, methought, as master of the sport,
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs
Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
After short course the father and the sons
Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw
The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke
Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard
My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?
Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
Of each misgave him through his dream, and I
Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up
The horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
I look'd upon the visage of my sons.
I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:
"Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?"  Yet
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day
Nor the next night, until another sun
Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam
Had to our doleful prison made its way,
And in four countenances I descry'd
The image of my own, on either hand
Through agony I bit, and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding, rose
O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve
Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,
'And do thou strip them off from us again.'
Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down
My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next
We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!
Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help
For me, my father!'  There he died, and e'en
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:
"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
Over them all, and for three days aloud
Call'd on them who were dead.  Then fasting got
The mastery of grief."  Thus having spoke,
Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone
Firm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame
Of all the people, who their dwelling make
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish, from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters!  What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betray'd
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack.  For them,
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make
Uncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass'd,
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.
There very weeping suffers not to weep;
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment, and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,
Under the socket brimming all the cup.
Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd
Some breath of wind I felt.  "Whence cometh this,"
Said I, "my master?  Is not here below
All vapour quench'd?"--"'Thou shalt be speedily,"
He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower."
Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
"O souls so cruel! that the farthest post
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart, some little space
Ere it congeal again!"  I thus replied:
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
And if I extricate thee not, far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend!"
"The friar Alberigo," answered he,
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
More luscious for my fig."--"Hah!"  I exclaim'd,
"Art thou too dead!"--"How in the world aloft
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,
"I am right ignorant.  Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,
As I did, yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will,
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
Falls to this cistern.  And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
Who here behind me winters.  Him thou know'st,
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.
The years are many that have pass'd away,
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."
"Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
But doth all natural functions of a man,
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."
He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body, and of one his kin,
Who with him treachery wrought.  But now put forth
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes."  I op'd them not.
Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth
Are ye not cancel'd?  Such an one of yours
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth.
CANTO XXXIV
"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,
"If thou discern him."  As, when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,
To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel) where the souls were all
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid,
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
That on his head, a third with face to feet
Arch'd like a bow.  When to the point we came,
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once,
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.
"Lo!"  he exclaim'd, "lo Dis! and lo the place,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."
How frozen and how faint I then became,
Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
I was not dead nor living.  Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all,
How I did feel.  That emperor, who sways
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.
Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
With such a part.  If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
May all our mis'ry flow.  Oh what a sight!
How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy
Upon his head three faces: one in front
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands.  Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings, enormous as became
A bird so vast.  Sails never such I saw
Outstretch'd on the wide sea.  No plumes had they,
But were in texture like a bat, and these
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three
Were in this guise tormented.  But far more
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin.  "That upper spirit,
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without.  Of th' other two,
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe
And speaks not!  Th' other Cassius, that appears
So large of limb.  But night now re-ascends,
And it is time for parting.  All is seen."
I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;
And noting time and place, he, when the wings
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
That into hell methought we turn'd again.
"Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
"We must depart from evil so extreme."
Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd
With wary step my side.  I rais'd mine eyes,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left, but saw him now
With legs held upward.  Let the grosser sort,
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.
"Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.
The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns."  It was no palace-hall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light.  "Ere from th' abyss
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,
"My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error's thralldom.  Where is now the ice?
How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?
And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit?"  He in few
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.
Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
All heavy substance.  Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.
Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.  Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.  On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.  Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."  There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.  By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
I want a hero: an uncommon want,
       When every year and month sends forth a new one,
     Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
       The age discovers he is not the true one;
     Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
     We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
     Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.
     Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
       Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
     Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
     Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
       Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:
     France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
     Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.
     Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
       Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
     Were French, and famous people, as we know:
       And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
     Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
       With many of the military set,
     Exceedingly remarkable at times,
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.
     Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
       'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
     Because the army 's grown more popular,
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
     Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.
     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
       But can't find any in the present age
     Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.
     Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
       (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
       What went before--by way of episode,
     While seated after dinner at his ease,
       Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
     Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
     Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.
     That is the usual method, but not mine--
       My way is to begin with the beginning;
     The regularity of my design
       Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
     And therefore I shall open with a line
       (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
     Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
     And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.
     In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
       Famous for oranges and women--he
     Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
       So says the proverb--and I quite agree;
     Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
       Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.
     His father's name was Jose--Don, of course,--
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
       Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
       Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
     Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
     Begot--but that 's to come--Well, to renew:
     His mother was a learned lady, famed
       For every branch of every science known
     In every Christian language ever named,
       With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     Finding themselves so very much exceeded
     In their own way by all the things that she did.
     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
       She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
     For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
     Could never make a memory so fine as
     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.
     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
     In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
       A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.
     She knew the Latin--that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
       And Greek--the alphabet--I 'm nearly sure;
     She read some French romances here and there,
       Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
       At least her conversation was obscure;
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.
     She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
       And said there was analogy between 'em;
     She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
       But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
     But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
       And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
     ''T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"
     The English always use to govern d--n.'
     Some women use their tongues--she look'd a lecture,
       Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
     An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
       Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
     The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
       Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').
     In short, she was a walking calculation,
       Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
     Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
       Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
     Morality's prim personification,
       In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
     For she had not even one--the worst of all.
     O! she was perfect past all parallel--
       Of any modern female saint's comparison;
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
     Even her minutest motions went as well
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
     Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!
     Perfect she was, but as perfection is
       Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
       Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
       (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
     Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
     Went plucking various fruit without her leave.
     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
       And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
       To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
     Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two--
     But for domestic quarrels one will do.
     Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
     And let few opportunities escape
     Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.
     This was an easy matter with a man
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
     And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
     And why and wherefore no one understands.
     'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
       With persons of no sort of education,
     Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
       Grow tired of scientific conversation:
     I don't choose to say much upon this head,
       I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
     But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
     Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?
     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd--why,
       Not any of the many could divine,
     Though several thousand people chose to try,
       'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
     I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
     Not having of my own domestic cares.
     And so I interfered, and with the best
       Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
     I think the foolish people were possess'd,
       For neither of them could I ever find,
     Although their porter afterwards confess'd--
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
     For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.
     A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
       And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
       Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
     Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
       Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
     To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
     To teach him manners for the time to come.
     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
       For some time an unhappy sort of life,
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
     Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.
     For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
       She next decided he was only bad;
     Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
       No sort of explanation could be had,
     Save that her duty both to man and God
     Required this conduct--which seem'd very odd.
     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
       And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
       And then she had all Seville for abettors,
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
       The hearers of her case became repeaters,
     Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
     Some for amusement, others for old grudges.
     And then this best and weakest woman bore
       With such serenity her husband's woes,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
       Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
     Never to say a word about them more--
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'
     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
       Is philosophic in our former friends;
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       The more so in obtaining our own ends;
     And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
       Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
     Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.
     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       And help them with a lie or two additional,
     I 'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is
       Any one else--they were become traditional;
     Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
       By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
     And science profits by this resurrection--
     Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.
     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
     ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
       To whom it may be best to have recourse--
     I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
     Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.
     He died: and most unluckily, because,
       According to all hints I could collect
     From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
       (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       A thousand pities also with respect
     To public feeling, which on this occasion
     Was manifested in a great sensation.
     But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
       The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
       A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
     A priest the other--at least so they say:
       I ask'd the doctors after his disease--
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
     And left his widow to her own aversion.
     Yet Jose was an honourable man,
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
       Indeed there were not many more to tell;
     And if his passions now and then outran
       Discretion, and were not so peaceable
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.
     Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
       Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
     Let 's own--since it can do no good on earth--
       It was a trying moment that which found him
     Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     Save death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.
     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
       To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
     Which, with a long minority and care,
       Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
     Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
       And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
     An only son left with an only mother
     Is brought up much more wisely than another.
     Sagest of women, even of widows, she
       Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
       In case our lord the king should go to war again,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.
     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       And saw into herself each day before all
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
     Much into all his studies she inquired,
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.
     The languages, especially the dead,
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
       To be the most remote from common use,
     In all these he was much and deeply read;
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
     Or hints continuation of the species,
     Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.
     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
     Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
       But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
       And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
     Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,
     For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.
     Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
       Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
     Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
       I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
     Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
     But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
     Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'
     Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
       For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
     I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
       Although no doubt his real intent was good,
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
     And then what proper person can be partial
     To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?
     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Expurgated by learned men, who place
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     They only add them all in an appendix,
     Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;
     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
       Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
       To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
     Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
       To call them back into their separate cages,
     Instead of standing staring all together,
     Like garden gods--and not so decent either.
     The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
       Was ornamented in a sort of way
     Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
       Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
     Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
       Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
     Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother
     Kept this herself, and gave her son another.
     Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     Which make the reader envy his transgressions.
     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--
       I can't but say that his mamma was right,
     If such an education was the true one.
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
       You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
     She did this during even her husband's life--
     I recommend as much to every wife.
     Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
       At six a charming child, and at eleven
     With all the promise of as fine a face
       As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.
     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
       At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
     Although in infancy a little wild,
       They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
     Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
     Her young philosopher was grown already.
     I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
     I knew his father well, and have some skill
       In character--but it would not be fair
     From sire to son to augur good or ill:
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
     But scandal 's my aversion--I protest
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.
     For my part I say nothing--nothing--but
       This I will say--my reasons are my own--
     That if I had an only son to put
       To school (as God be praised that I have none),
     'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
     No--no--I 'd send him out betimes to college,
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.
     For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,
       Though I acquired--but I pass over that,
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
       I say that there 's the place--but 'Verbum sat.'
     I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
       Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--
     I never married--but, I think, I know
     That sons should not be educated so.
     Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
       And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
     If any said so, for to be precocious
     Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.
     Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
       Selected for discretion and devotion,
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
       Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
     Of many charms in her as natural
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).
     The darkness of her Oriental eye
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
     (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
       In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.
     She married (I forget the pedigree)
       With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
       At such alliances his sires would frown,
     In that point so precise in each degree
       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
     Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,
     Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.
     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
       Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
     For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
       Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
       But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
     'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
     Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.
     However this might be, the race went on
       Improving still through every generation,
     Until it centred in an only son,
       Who left an only daughter; my narration
     May have suggested that this single one
       Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
     I shall have much to speak about), and she
     Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.
     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
       Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
     Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
       Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
     And love than either; and there would arise
       A something in them which was not desire,
     But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
     Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.
     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
       Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
     Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
       As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
     Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
     Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.
     Wedded she was some years, and to a man
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
     And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
       'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
     Especially in countries near the sun:
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
     Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.
     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
       And all the fault of that indecent sun,
     Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
       But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.
     Happy the nations of the moral North!
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
     Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
       ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
     Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
       By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     Because it is a marketable vice.
     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       A man well looking for his years, and who
     Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
       They lived together, as most people do,
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
       And not exactly either one or two;
     Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
     For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.
     Julia was--yet I never could see why--
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
       For malice still imputes some private end,
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
     Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;
     And that still keeping up the old connection,
       Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
     She took his lady also in affection,
       And certainly this course was much the best:
     She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
       And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     At least she left it a more slender handle.
     I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
       With other people's eyes, or if her own
     Discoveries made, but none could be aware
       Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
       Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
     I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.
     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
       Caress'd him often--such a thing might be
     Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
       When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
       When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.
     Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
       And much embarrassment in either eye;
     There surely will be little doubt with some
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.
     Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
       'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
     Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
     Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.
     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
     For that compression in its burning core;
       Even innocence itself has many a wile,
     And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
     And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.
     But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
       Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
     Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
       Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
     And in whatever aspect it arrays
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
     Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.
     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
     And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
       Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
     All these are little preludes to possession,
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
     And merely tend to show how greatly love is
     Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.
     Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
       She felt it going, and resolved to make
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
       For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
     Her resolutions were most truly great,
       And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.
     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
       And next day paid a visit to his mother,
     And look'd extremely at the opening door,
       Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
     Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--
       Again it opens, it can be no other,
     'T is surely Juan now--No! I 'm afraid
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.
     She now determined that a virtuous woman
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
       Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
     For people who are pleasanter than others,
     But then they only seem so many brothers.
     And even if by chance--and who can tell?
       The devil 's so very sly--she should discover
     That all within was not so very well,
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
     Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     I recommend young ladies to make trial.
     And then there are such things as love divine,
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
     Such as the angels think so very fine,
       And matrons who would be no less secure,
     Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
       Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.
     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       Between young persons without any danger.
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
       Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
     If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
     But not my fault--I tell them all in time.
     Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
       Was Julia's innocent determination
     In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
       Exertion might be useful on occasion;
     And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
       Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
     He might be taught, by love and her together--
     I really don't know what, nor Julia either.
     Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
       In mail of proof--her purity of soul--
     She, for the future of her strength convinced.
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
       With any kind of troublesome control;
     But whether Julia to the task was equal
     Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.
     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
       Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
     Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
     Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.
     And if in the mean time her husband died,
       But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
       Never could she survive that common loss;
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
       I only say suppose it--inter nos.
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)
     I only say suppose this supposition:
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
     Would fully suit a widow of condition,
       Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
     For he would learn the rudiments of love,
     I mean the seraph way of those above.
     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
       Poor little fellow! he had no idea
     Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
       In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
     Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.
     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
     Tormented with a wound he could not know,
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
     I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
     By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.
     'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
       Where transport and security entwine,
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
       And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
     The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
       With the exception of the second line,
     For that same twining 'transport and security'
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.
     The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
       To the good sense and senses of mankind,
     The very thing which every body feels,
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
     That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
       Or love.--I won't say more about 'entwined'
     Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
     But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.
     Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Himself at length within the leafy nooks
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     There poets find materials for their books,
       And every now and then we read them through,
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.
     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
       With things not very subject to control,
     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.
     He thought about himself, and the whole earth
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     How many miles the moon might have in girth,
       Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.
     In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
       Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
     Which some are born with, but the most part learn
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
     'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
       His brain about the action of the sky;
     If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
     I can't help thinking puberty assisted.
     He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
       And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
     He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
       And how the goddesses came down to men:
     He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     He found how much old Time had been a winner--
     He also found that he had lost his dinner.
     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind
     Even as the page is rustled while we look,
       So by the poesy of his own mind
     Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
     According to some good old woman's tale.
     Thus would he while his lonely hours away
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
       Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
     With--several other things, which I forget,
     Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.
     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
       Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
     Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
     Or, like all very clever people, could not.
     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
       For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
       And break the--Which commandment is 't they break?
     (I have forgot the number, and think no man
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
     I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
     They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.
     A real husband always is suspicious,
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
       Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
     By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
     And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
     He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.
     Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
       Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
       Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
     Till some confounded escapade has blighted
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
     And wonders why the devil he got heirs.
     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
     She had some other motive much more near
       For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
     But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     In case he thought his wife too great a prize.
     It was upon a day, a summer's day;-
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
     And so is spring about the end of May;
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
     But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--
     March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.
     'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:--
       I like to be particular in dates,
     Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
       They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
     Change horses, making history change its tune,
       Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Excepting the post-obits of theology.
     'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
       Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
       To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
     With all the trophies of triumphant song--
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!
     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
       How this same interview had taken place,
     And even if I knew, I should not tell--
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
       But there were she and Juan, face to face--
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.
     How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
       Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     How self-deceitful is the sagest part
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along--
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
     So was her creed in her own innocence.
     She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
     Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
       Because that number rarely much endears,
     And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.
     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
       They mean to scold, and very often do;
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
       They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
     In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
       At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
     But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
     A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.
     Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
       For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
     By all the vows below to powers above,
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
     Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
     Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;
     Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
       Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
     'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so--
     I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.
     The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
       Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
       Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
     His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.
     I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
       But what he did, is much what you would do;
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
     She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
     And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.
     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
       The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
     Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
       Sees half the business in a wicked way
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile--
     And then she looks so modest all the while.
     There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
     To open all itself, without the power
       Of calling wholly back its self-control;
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
     Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
     A loving languor, which is not repose.
     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
     Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
       Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
     Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
       But then the situation had its charm,
     And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
     I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.
     O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
       With your confounded fantasies, to more
     Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
       Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
       Of poets and romancers:--You 're a bore,
     A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,
     At best, no better than a go-between.
     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
       Until too late for useful conversation;
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
       Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'--consented.
     'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
       To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
     Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
       And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
     I care not for new pleasures, as the old
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.
     O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
       Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
     I make a resolution every spring
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
       Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
     I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
     And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.
     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
       Start not! still chaster reader--she 'll be nice hence--
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
       This liberty is a poetic licence,
     Which some irregularity may make
       In the design, and as I have a high sense
     Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
     To beg his pardon when I err a bit.
     This licence is to hope the reader will
       Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
     Without whose epoch my poetic skill
       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
       In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
     'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
     About the day--the era 's more obscure.
     We 'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
     The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
       By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
     'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
       'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.
     'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
       Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
     'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
       Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
     'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
       Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
     Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
     The lisp of children, and their earliest words.
     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
       In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
     Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
       From civic revelry to rural mirth;
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
       Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
     Sweet is revenge--especially to women,
     Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.
     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
       The unexpected death of some old lady
     Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
       Who 've made 'us youth' wait too--too long already
     For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.
     'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
       By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
     To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
     Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
       Dear is the helpless creature we defend
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.
     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
       Is first and passionate love--it stands alone,
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
       The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd--all 's known--
     And life yields nothing further to recall
       Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
     No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
     Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.
     Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     And likes particularly to produce
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
       Where different talents find their different marts;
     You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
     Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.
     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
       (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
     One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
     But vaccination certainly has been
       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
     With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
     By borrowing a new one from an ox.
     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
       And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
       Of the Humane Society's beginning
     By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
       What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
     I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.
     'T is said the great came from America;
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,--
     The population there so spreads, they say
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
     With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
     Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?
     This is the patent-age of new inventions
       For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
     All propagated with the best intentions;
       Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
     Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
     Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.
     Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
     'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
       Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
     Few mortals know what end they would be at,
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
     The path is through perplexing ways, and when
     The goal is gain'd, we die, you know--and then--
     What then?--I do not know, no more do you--
       And so good night.--Return we to our story:
     'T was in November, when fine days are few,
       And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
     And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
     And sober suns must set at five o'clock.
     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
       No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
     By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
       With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
       Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
     I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
     A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.
     'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
       Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
       If they had never been awoke before,
     And that they have been so we all have read,
       And are to be so, at the least, once more;--
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     First knocks were heard, then 'Madam--Madam--hist!
     'For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here 's my master,
       With more than half the city at his back--
     Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
       'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
       They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
     Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'
     By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
       With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
     The major part of them had long been wived,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     Of any wicked woman, who contrived
       By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
     Examples of this kind are so contagious,
     Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.
     I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
       Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
     But for a cavalier of his condition
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Without a word of previous admonition,
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.
     Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
       (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),
     Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
     I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.
     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
       Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
       Until the hours of absence should run through,
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     'My dear, I was the first who came away.'
     Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
       'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
       Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
     What may this midnight violence betide,
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
     Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
     Search, then, the room!'--Alfonso said, 'I will.'
     He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
       Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     With other articles of ladies fair,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
     And wounded several shutters, and some boards.
     Under the bed they search'd, and there they found--
       No matter what--it was not that they sought;
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
       Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
       'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
     And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
     Of looking in the bed as well as under.
     During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
       Was not asleep--'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
     'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
       It was for this that I became a bride!
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
     If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.
     'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
       If ever you indeed deserved the name,
     Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
       Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--
     Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
       For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
     Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
     How dare you think your lady would go on so?
     'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
       The common privileges of my sex?
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       And deaf, that any other it would vex,
     And never once he has had cause to scold,
       But found my very innocence perplex
     So much, he always doubted I was married--
     How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!
     'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
       I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
     Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
       Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
     Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
       I favor'd none--nay, was almost uncivil?
     Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
     Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?
     'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
       Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
     Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
       Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
     Were there not also Russians, English, many?
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
     Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.
     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
     And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
       I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
     I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
       Me also, since the time so opportune is--
     O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
     Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?
     'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
       Under pretence of business indispensable
     With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
       Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
     Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
     And not from any love to you nor me.
     'If he comes here to take a deposition,
       By all means let the gentleman proceed;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
     Let every thing be noted with precision,
       I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
     But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'
     'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
       The antechamber--search them under, over;
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
       The chimney--which would really hold a lover.
     I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--
     And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.
     'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
       Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
     Pray have the courtesy to make it known
       Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal
     Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown--
       I hope he 's young and handsome--is he tall?
     Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain
     My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.
     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
     Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
     I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
     My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
     That I should fall into a monster's power.
     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
       Look where you please--we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
       Or for the sake of decency abide
     A moment at the door, that we may be
     Drest to receive so much good company.
     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
       The little I have said may serve to show
     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     I leave you to your conscience as before,
       'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
     God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
     Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'
     She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
     With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
       Following Antonia's motions here and there,
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
       For reputations he had little care;
     So that a suit or action were made good,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
     And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
     Were proved by competent false witnesses.
     But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
     When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
       And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
       Added to those his lady with such vigour
     Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
     Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.
     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
     And indications of hysterics, whose
       Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
     Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.
     He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
       With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
     Or madam dies.'--Alfonso mutter'd, 'D--n her,'
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.
     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
       The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
     Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
       Antonia let him--not a little sore
     At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
       In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
     An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.
     No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh shame!
       O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
     How can you do such things and keep your fame,
       Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
     Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
       But to proceed--for there is more behind:
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.
     He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
       How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
     Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
     But pity him I neither must nor may
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
     'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.
     And, secondly, I pity not, because
       He had no business to commit a sin,
     Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
     But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.
     Of his position I can give no notion:
       'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
     How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
       Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
     When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     For David lived, but Juan nearly died.
     What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
     Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
       But no device could be brought into play--
     And how to parry the renew'd attack?
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
     Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
     But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.
     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
       Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
     Even then their love they could not all command,
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
       'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
     She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit
     This pretty gentleman within the closet:
     'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--
       Who can have put my master in this mood?
     What will become on 't--I 'm in such a fright,
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good--
     Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
     My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.
     'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)--
     But for a child, what piece of work is here!
       I really, madam, wonder at your taste
     (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'
     Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
       Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
     She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     However, present remedy was none,
       And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
     Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.
     Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
       Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
     He would not justify what he had done,
       To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
       Of which he specified in this his pleading:
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'
     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
       A ready answer, which at once enables
     A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
       By a few timely words to turn the tables,
     Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--
       Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
     'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.
     Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--
       Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
     But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
       But that can't be, as has been often shown,
     A lady with apologies abounds;--
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
     From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.
     There might be one more motive, which makes two;
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--
     Mention'd his jealousy but never who
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
     Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
     To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.
     A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
     (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)-
     Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
       A lady always distant from the fact:
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.
     They blush, and we believe them; at least I
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
     In any case, attempting a reply,
       For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
       And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
     And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.
     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
       Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
       Denying several little things he wanted:
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
       With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
     Beseeching she no further would refuse,
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.
     A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
     (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
       Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
     Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
       My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze--
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     And then flew out into another passion.
     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
     'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake--not a word--
       The door is open--you may yet slip through
     The passage you so often have explored--
       Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
     Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
     Day has not broke--there 's no one in the street:
     None can say that this was not good advice,
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
     Of all experience 't is the usual price,
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
       And might have done so by the garden-gate,
     But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
     Who threaten'd death--so Juan knock'd him down.
     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
       Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.
     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
       His temper not being under great command,
     If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
     Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
     And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!
     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
     And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
       And then his only garment quite gave way;
     He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
     I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.
     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
       Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.
     Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
       How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
     Who favours what she should not, found his way,
       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
     Were in the English newspapers, of course.
     If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
       The depositions, and the cause at full,
     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
       Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
       Are various, but they none of them are dull;
     The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
     Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.
     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
       Of one of the most circulating scandals
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
       At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
     First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
       To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.
     She had resolved that he should travel through
       All European climes, by land or sea,
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
       Especially in France and Italy
     (At least this is the thing most people do).
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--
     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
       'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
     I have no further claim on your young heart,
       Mine is the victim, and would be again;
     To love too much has been the only art
       I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
     Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
     My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.
     'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
     Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.
     'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
       'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     Men have all these resources, we but one,
     To love again, and be again undone.
     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
       Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
       My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
       The passion which still rages as before--
     And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
     That word is idle now--but let it go.
     'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
     My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
     My heart is feminine, nor can forget--
       To all, except one image, madly blind;
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.
     'I have no more to say, but linger still,
       And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
       My misery can scarce be more complete:
     I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
       Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
     And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'
     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
       It trembled as magnetic needles do,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
       The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.
     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
       I shall proceed with his adventures is
     Dependent on the public altogether;
       We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
       And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
     And if their approbation we experience,
     Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.
     My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
       Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
     With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
       A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
     After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
     So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.
     All these things will be specified in time,
       With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
       Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
     Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
       Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.
     There 's only one slight difference between
       Me and my epic brethren gone before,
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
       (Not that I have not several merits more,
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
     Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
     Whereas this story 's actually true.
     If any person doubt it, I appeal
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
     Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.
     If ever I should condescend to prose,
       I 'll write poetical commandments, which
     Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
       That went before; in these I shall enrich
     My text with many things that no one knows,
       And carry precept to the highest pitch:
     I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
     Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'
     Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
       Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
     Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
       The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
       And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
     Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
     Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.
     Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
       His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
     Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
       (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
     Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
       This is true criticism, and you may kiss--
     Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;
     If any person should presume to assert
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
     The very place where wicked people go.
     If, after all, there should be some so blind
       To their own good this warning to despise,
     Led by some tortuosity of mind,
       Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
     And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
       I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     They also lie too--under a mistake.
     The public approbation I expect,
       And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
     Which I with their amusement will connect
       (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
     Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
       My epical pretensions to the laurel:
     For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
     I 've bribed my grandmother's review--the British.
     I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
       Who thank'd me duly by return of post--
     I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
       Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
     And break a promise after having made it her,
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
     All I can say is--that he had the money.
     I think that with this holy new alliance
       I may ensure the public, and defy
     All other magazines of art or science,
       Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
       Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
     And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
     Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.
     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
       Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
     Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
       Hint that some six or seven good years ago
     (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
       I was most ready to return a blow,
     And would not brook at all this sort of thing
     In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.
     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
       (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
     I thought of a peruke the other day)--
       My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
       And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
     Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
     And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.
     No more--no more--Oh! never more on me
       The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
     Which out of all the lovely things we see
       Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.
     No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
       Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
       Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
     And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
     Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.
     My days of love are over; me no more
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
     Can make the fool of which they made before,--
       In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
       The copious use of claret is forbid too,
     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
     I think I must take up with avarice.
     Ambition was my idol, which was broken
       Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
     And the two last have left me many a token
       O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
     Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
       'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'--a chymic treasure
     Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes--
     My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.
     What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
       And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
     To have, when the original is dust,
     A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.
     What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
       Cheops erected the first pyramid
     And largest, thinking it was just the thing
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
     But somebody or other rummaging,
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
     Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
     Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.
     But I being fond of true philosophy,
       Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
     All things that have been born were born to die,
       And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
     You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
       And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'
     But for the present, gentle reader! and
       Still gentler purchaser! the bard--that 's I--
     Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
       And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
     We meet again, if we should understand
       Each other; and if not, I shall not try
     Your patience further than by this short sample--
     'T were well if others follow'd my example.
     'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
       I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
     And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
       I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
     The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
     For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.
[Illustration: Canto 2]
   O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
     I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
     The best of mothers and of educations
       In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
     Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he
     Became divested of his native modesty.
     Had he but been placed at a public school,
       In the third form, or even in the fourth,
     His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
       At least, had he been nurtured in the north;
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
       But then exceptions always prove its worth--
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
     Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.
     I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
       If all things be consider'd: first, there was
     His lady--mother, mathematical,
       A--never mind; his tutor, an old ass;
     A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,
       Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.
     Well--well, the world must turn upon its axis,
       And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
       And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
     Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.
     I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
       A pretty town, I recollect it well--
     'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
       (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),
     And such sweet girls--I mean, such graceful ladies,
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
     Nor liken it--I never saw the like:
     An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     No--none of these will do;--and then their garb!
       Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
     Upon such things would very near absorb
       A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,
     Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
     (And so, my sober Muse--come, let 's be steady--
     Chaste Muse!--well, if you must, you must)--the veil
       Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
     While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
       Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       To--say my prayers--but never was there plann'd
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
     Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.
     But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
       Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
     To stay there had not answer'd her intent,
       But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--
     'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
     To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
     And send him like a dove of promise forth.
     Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
       According to direction, then received
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
       She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Of good advice--and two or three of credit.
     In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
     For naughty children, who would rather play
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
     Infants of three years old were taught that day,
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
     The great success of Juan's education,
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.
     Juan embark'd--the ship got under way,
       The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
       As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
       Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
     His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.
     I can't but say it is an awkward sight
       To see one's native land receding through
     The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
       Especially when life is rather new:
     I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
       But almost every other country 's blue,
     When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
     We enter on our nautical existence.
     So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
     The best of remedies is a beef-steak
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
     For I have found it answer--so may you.
     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Beheld his native Spain receding far:
     First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
       Even nations feel this when they go to war;
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
       A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
     But Juan had got many things to leave,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     So that he had much better cause to grieve
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
     And if we now and then a sigh must heave
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.
     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
       By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
     I 'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
     Young men should travel, if but to amuse
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
     Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
     Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.
     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
       You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,
     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
       Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he
     Reflected on his present situation,
     And seriously resolved on reformation.
     'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
     Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
       Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
     Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(Here he drew
     Her letter out again, and read it through.)
     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be--
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
       Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
       Or think of any thing excepting thee;
     A mind diseased no remedy can physic
     (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).
     'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
       O, Julia! what is every other wo?
     (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
       Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
     Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)--
     Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
     (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)
     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
       Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
       The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
     Or death of those we dote on, when a part
       Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I
     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
       Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
     But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
       And find a quincy very hard to treat;
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
       But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
     Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
     Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.
     But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
       About the lower region of the bowels;
     Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
       Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
       Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
     Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
     Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?
     The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
       Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
     For there the Spanish family Moncada
       Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
     They were relations, and for them he had a
       Letter of introduction, which the morn
     Of his departure had been sent him by
     His Spanish friends for those in Italy.
     His suite consisted of three servants and
       A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
     Who several languages did understand,
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.
     'T was not without some reason, for the wind
       Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
     For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,
     And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.
     At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
       Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
     Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
     Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
       Herself from out her present jeopardy,
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.
     One gang of people instantly was put
       Upon the pumps and the remainder set
     To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
       But they could not come at the leak as yet;
     At last they did get at it really, but
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
     While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,
     Into the opening; but all such ingredients
       Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
       But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
     To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
       For fifty tons of water were upthrown
     By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.
     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
     And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
     A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
     Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.
     There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
       The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
       For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
     Or any other thing that brings regret,
       Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
     Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,
     And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.
     Immediately the masts were cut away,
       Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
       Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
     Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
       Eased her at last (although we never meant
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     And then with violence the old ship righted.
     It may be easily supposed, while this
       Was going on, some people were unquiet,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
       To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
     That even the able seaman, deeming his
       Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
     As upon such occasions tars will ask
     For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.
     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
       The high wind made the treble, and as bas
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
       Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.
     Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
       Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
     Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
       It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
     As if Death were more dreadful by his door
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
     Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.
     'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be
       All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!
     'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     Like brutes;'--and thus his dangerous post kept he,
       And none liked to anticipate the blow;
     And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
     Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.
     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
     Repented all his sins, and made a last
       Irrevocable vow of reformation;
     Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
       To quit his academic occupation,
     In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
     To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.
     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
       Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
       The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
       Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.
     Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
       Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.
     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
       Without their will, they carried them away;
     For they were forced with steering to dispense,
       And never had as yet a quiet day
     On which they might repose, or even commence
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
     The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
     Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.
     The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     To weather out much longer; the distress
       Was also great with which they had to cope
     For want of water, and their solid mess
       Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
     Was used--nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,
     Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.
     Again the weather threaten'd,--again blew
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
     Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     Until the chains and leathers were worn through
       Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she roll'd,
     At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
     Like human beings during civil war.
     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
       In his rough eyes, and told the captain he
     Could do no more: he was a man in years,
       And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
     And if he wept at length, they were not fears
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
     But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
     Two things for dying people quite bewildering.
     The ship was evidently settling now
       Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
       Of candles to their saints--but there were none
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
     Who told him to be damn'd--in his confusion.
     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
     And others went on as they had begun,
       Getting the boats out, being well aware
     That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
     Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.
     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
       Having been several days in great distress,
     'T was difficult to get out such provision
       As now might render their long suffering less:
     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
     Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.
     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
       Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
     Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
       Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
     A portion of their beef up from below,
       And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.
     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
       Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
       Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     To save one half the people then on board.
     'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
       Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
     Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
     Been their familiar, and now Death was here.
     Some trial had been making at a raft,
       With little hope in such a rolling sea,
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
       If any laughter at such times could be,
     Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:--
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.
     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
       And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
     She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
     And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.
     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
       Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
       And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,
     Like one who grapples with his enemy,
     And strives to strangle him before he die.
     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
       Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
       Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
     Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,
       Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony.
     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
       Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       And then they were too many, though so few--
     Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
     Were counted in them when they got afloat.
     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls
       Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
     When over Catholics the ocean rolls,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
     Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
       Because, till people know what 's come to pass,
     They won't lay out their money on the dead--
     It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.
     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
       Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
       For Juan wore the magisterial face
     Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
       Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
     Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),
     Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.
     Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
     And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     Because the sea ran higher every minute,
     And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.
     A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jose's,
       His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
     For on such things the memory reposes
       With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.
     He also stuff'd his money where he could
       About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
     Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
       Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
       But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
     And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
     Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.
     'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
       That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,
     Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
       They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
     Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.
     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill
       Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:
     Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
       And present peril all before surpass'd,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
     And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.
     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
     Before the sea until it should grow fine,
       Was all that for the present could be done:
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
       Were served out to the people, who begun
     To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
     And most of them had little clothes but rags.
     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
     They did their best to modify their case,
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
     While t'other half were laid down in their place
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
     Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,
     With nothing but the sky for a great coat.
     'T is very certain the desire of life
       Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
     Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
       Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.
     'T is said that persons living on annuities
       Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,
     Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
       And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
     In my young days they lent me cash that way,
     Which I found very troublesome to pay.
     'T is thus with people in an open boat,
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
     And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
     She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
     Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.
     But man is a carnivorous production,
       And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
     Although his anatomical construction
       Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
     Your labouring people think beyond all question,
     Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.
     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
       For on the third day there came on a calm,
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
     Instead of hoarding it with due precision.
     The consequence was easily foreseen--
       They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
     In spite of all remonstrances, and then
       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
     They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
       And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     It would have been more wise to save their victual.
     The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--
     With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
       What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.
     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
       Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
     With some remorse received (though first denied)
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
     Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.
     The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun
       Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
       Save in the breeze that came not; savagely
     They glared upon each other--all was done,
       Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.
     At length one whisper'd his companion, who
       Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
       'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.
     But ere they came to this, they that day shared
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
       And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
       But of materials that much shock the Muse--
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
       In silent horror, and their distribution
     Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
       'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
     By which none were permitted to be neuter--
     And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.
     He but requested to be bled to death:
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
     Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,
       You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
     He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.
     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
     But being thirstiest at the moment, he
       Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
     Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
     Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow--
     The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.
     The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
     To these was added Juan, who, before
       Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
     Feel now his appetite increased much more;
       'T was not to be expected that he should,
     Even in extremity of their disaster,
     Dine with them on his pastor and his master.
     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
     For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
       Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
     And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.
     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
       And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,
     For having used their appetites so sadly.
     And next they thought upon the master's mate,
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
     Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
     By general subscription of the ladies.
     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
       Or but at times a little supper made;
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
       Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
     At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
     And then they left off eating the dead body.
     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
       Remember Ugolino condescends
     To eat the head of his arch-enemy
       The moment after he politely ends
     His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
       'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.
     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
       For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
     When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain
       Men really know not what good water 's worth;
     If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
       Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,
     Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
     You 'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.
     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
       Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
     Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
       Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
     As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
     They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.
     And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
     Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
     To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
     To taste of heaven--If this be true, indeed
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.
     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
       And with them their two sons, of whom the one
     Was more robust and hardy to the view,
       But he died early; and when he was gone,
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
     I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
     Into the deep without a tear or groan.
     The other father had a weaklier child,
       Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
       As if to win a part from off the weight
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     With the deep deadly thought that they must part.
     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
     Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.
     The boy expired--the father held the clay,
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
     Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
       'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
     Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
     And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.
     Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
       The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
     Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
       And all within its arch appear'd to be
     Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
       Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,
     Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
     Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.
     It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,
       The airy child of vapour and the sun,
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
       Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
     Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
       And blending every colour into one,
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).
     Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen--
       It is as well to think so, now and then;
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
       And may become of great advantage when
     Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope--
     Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.
     About this time a beautiful white bird,
       Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd
       Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
     It came and went, and flutter'd round them till
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.
     But in this case I also must remark,
       'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
     Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark
       Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
       Returning there from her successful search,
     Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.
     With twilight it again came on to blow,
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
     Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'
       The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     And all mistook about the latter once.
     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
     If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
       Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.
     And then of these some part burst into tears,
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
     Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
     While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)--
       And at the bottom of the boat three were
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.
     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
       Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
     Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
       Because it left encouragement behind:
     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.
     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
     Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
       In various conjectures, for none knew
     To what part of the earth they had been tost,
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
     Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,
     Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.
     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
       Their living freight was now reduced to four,
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
       To heave into the deep with those before,
     Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.
     Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done
       Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one
       They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
     But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
     In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.
     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
       Unequal in its aspect here and there,
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
     Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.
     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
       And girt by formidable waves; but they
     Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
       Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
     A reef between them also now began
       To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.
     But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
       Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
       Had often turn'd the art to some account:
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
       He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.
     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
       He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
     With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
       The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
     The greatest danger here was from a shark,
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.
     Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
       Which, providentially for him, was wash'd
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
     Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:
     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
       Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
     And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.
     With slow and staggering effort he arose,
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
       Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
       Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
     Who died two days before, and now had found
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.
     And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
       And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
       And, like a wither'd lily, on the land
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.
     How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
       For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
     For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.
     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
       For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
       And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
       And then once more his feelings back were brought,
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     A lovely female face of seventeen.
     'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
       Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;
     And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
       Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;
     And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
       Each pulse to animation, till beneath
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
     To these kind efforts made a low reply.
     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
     Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
     A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.
     And lifting him with care into the cave,
       The gentle girl and her attendant,--one
     Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
       And more robust of figure,--then begun
     To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
     Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.
     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
       In braids behind; and though her stature were
     Even of the highest for a female mould,
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     There was a something which bespoke command,
     As one who was a lady in the land.
     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
       Deepest attraction; for when to the view
     Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
     'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
     And hurls at once his venom and his strength.
     Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
     Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
       Ever to have seen such; for she was one
     Fit for the model of a statuary
       (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done--
     I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).
     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
       I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
       Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
     Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.
     And such was she, the lady of the cave:
       Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
       For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
     Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
       Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
     The basquina and the mantilla, they
     Seem at the same time mystical and gay.
     But with our damsel this was not the case:
       Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
       Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone
     Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
     Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.
     The other female's dress was not unlike,
       But of inferior materials: she
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
       Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
     As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.
     And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
     Which are (as I must own) of female growth,
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
     They made a most superior mess of broth,
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
     But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's
     Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.
     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
       Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
       Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;
     And so, in short, the girls they really were
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
     Of an old man who lived upon the water.
     A fisherman he had been in his youth,
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
     But other speculations were, in sooth,
       Added to his connection with the sea,
     Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
       A little smuggling, and some piracy,
     Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
     Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.
     A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,
       Like Peter the Apostle,--and he fish'd
     For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
     By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.
     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
       (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
     A very handsome house from out his guilt,
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
     But this I know, it was a spacious building,
     Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.
     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
       She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
     Rejected several suitors, just to learn
     How to accept a better in his turn.
     And walking out upon the beach, below
       The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
     Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
     But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
       Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.
     But taking him into her father's house
       Was not exactly the best way to save,
     But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
       Or people in a trance into their grave;
     Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'
       Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
     And sold him instantly when out of danger.
     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
       (A virgin always on her maid relies)
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     Their charity increased about their guest;
       And their compassion grew to such a size,
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
     (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).
     They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
       Upon the moment could contrive with such
     Materials as were cast up round the bay,--
       Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
       A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.
     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
       For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,
       She and her maid--and promised by daybreak
     To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
     For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.
     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
     Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Not even a vision of his former woes
       Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
     Unwelcome visions of our former years,
     Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.
     Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,
       Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den
     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
     He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
     That at this moment Juan knew it not.
     And pensive to her father's house she went,
       Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
     Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
       She being wiser by a year or two:
     A year or two 's an age when rightly spent,
       And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
     In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
     Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.
     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
       Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
       And the young beams of the excluded sun,
     Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
       And need he had of slumber yet, for none
     Had suffer'd more--his hardships were comparative
     To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'
     Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,
       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
       And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore
     In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--
     They knew not what to think of such a freak.
     But up she got, and up she made them get,
       With some pretence about the sun, that makes
     Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
       And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
     Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
       With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
     And night is flung off like a mourning suit
     Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.
     I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     I have sat up on purpose all the night,
       Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
       In health and purse, begin your day to date
     From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,
     Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.
     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
       From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
       That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
     Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.
     And down the cliff the island virgin came,
       And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
     While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,
       And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
     Taking her for a sister; just the same
       Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
     Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.
     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
       And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
     (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
     Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
     Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.
     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
       Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
     But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Must breakfast--and betimes, lest they should ask it,
     She drew out her provision from the basket.
     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
       And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
       I can't say that she gave them any tea,
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
     With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.
     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
     Because her mistress would not let her break
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.
     For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
     Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
     Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,
     Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.
     And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
       Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
       Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,
     Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
     In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
     Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.
     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       For Juan, so that even when he pray'd
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
     To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.
     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
       And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
       As with an effort she began to speak;
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
       Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.
     Now Juan could not understand a word,
       Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,
     Whence Melody descends as from a throne.
     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
       By a distant organ, doubting if he be
     Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
       By the watchman, or some such reality,
     Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;
       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
     Who like a morning slumber--for the night
     Shows stars and women in a better light.
     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling
     A most prodigious appetite: the steam
       Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
     Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
       Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling
     To stir her viands, made him quite awake
     And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.
     But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
       Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
       For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
     Others are fair and fertile, among which
     This, though not large, was one of the most rich.
     I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
       That the old fable of the Minotaur--
     From which our modern morals rightly shrinking
       Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
     A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.
     For we all know that English people are
       Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,
     Because 't is liquor only, and being far
       From this my subject, has no business here;
     We know, too, they very fond of war,
       A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
     So were the Cretans--from which I infer
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.
     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
       His head upon his elbow, and he saw
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
       As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
     Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.
     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
       Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
     But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.
     And so she took the liberty to state,
       Rather by deeds than words, because the case
     Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
     The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
       Unless he wish'd to die upon the place--
     She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
     Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.
     Next they--he being naked, save a tatter'd
       Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
       And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,
     Or Greek--that is, although it not much matter'd,
       Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,--
     They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
     With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.
     And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
     Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
     And, as he interrupted not, went eking
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
     Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.
     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
       And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
       Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
       And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
     A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.
     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
       And words repeated after her, he took
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
       No doubt, less of her language than her look:
     As he who studies fervently the skies
       Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.
     'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue
       By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,
     When both the teacher and the taught are young,
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
       They smile still more, and then there intervene
     Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--
     I learn'd the little that I know by this:
     That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
       Italian not at all, having no teachers;
     Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
       Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
     Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
       I study, also Blair, the highest reachers
     Of eloquence in piety and prose--
     I hate your poets, so read none of those.
     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
       Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
       And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
     Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.
     Return we to Don Juan. He begun
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
     More than within the bosom of a nun:
       He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
     With a young benefactress,--so was she,
     Just in the way we very often see.
     And every day by daybreak--rather early
       For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--
     She came into the cave, but it was merely
       To see her bird reposing in his nest;
     And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
       Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
     Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
     As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.
     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       And every day help'd on his convalescence;
     'T was well, because health in the human frame
       Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
     For health and idleness to passion's flame
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
     Without whom Venus will not long attack us.
     While Venus fills the heart (without heart really
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,--
     While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
       Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
     But who is their purveyor from above
     Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.
     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
       A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
     That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
       Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
     But I have spoken of all this already--
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,--
     Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,
     Came always back to coffee and Haidee.
     Both were so young, and one so innocent,
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
     A something to be loved, a creature meant
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
     To render happy; all who joy would win
     Must share it,--Happiness was born a twin.
     It was such pleasure to behold him, such
       Enlargement of existence to partake
     Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
       To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
     To live with him forever were too much;
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
     Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.
     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
       Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he
       Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;
     At last her father's prows put out to sea
       For certain merchantmen upon the look,
     Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
     But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.
     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
       So that, her father being at sea, she was
     Free as a married woman, or such other
       Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
     Without even the incumbrance of a brother,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
     I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
     Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.
     Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk
       (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
     So much as to propose to take a walk,--
       For little had he wander'd since the day
     On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.
     It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
     Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     Save on the dead long summer days, which make
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.
     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
       Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,
     When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
       Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--
     Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,
     Sermons and soda-water the day after.
     Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
       The best of life is but intoxication:
     Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
     But to return,--Get very drunk; and when
     You wake with headache, you shall see what then.
     Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
       Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know
     A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
       For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,
     Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
       Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
     Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.
     The coast--I think it was the coast that
       Was just describing--Yes, it was the coast--
     Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
     And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
       And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost
     By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
     Against the boundary it scarcely wet.
     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
     And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
       Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
       Thought daily service was her only mission,
     Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
     And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.
     It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
       Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
     Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
       Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,
     With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     Upon the other, and the rosy sky,
     With one star sparkling through it like an eye.
     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
       Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
     Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,
       And in the worn and wild receptacles
     Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,
       In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.
     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
     Into each other--and, beholding this,
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;
     A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,
       And beauty, all concentrating like rays
     Into one focus, kindled from above;
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
     Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,
       And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
     Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
     I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.
     By length I mean duration; theirs endured
       Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;
     And if they had, they could not have secured
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
     Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung--
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.
     They were alone, but not alone as they
       Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
       The twilight glow which momently grew less,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
       Around them, made them to each other press,
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
     Save theirs, and that their life could never die.
     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
       They felt no terrors from the night, they were
     All in all to each other: though their speech
       Was broken words, they thought a language there,--
     And all the burning tongues the passions teach
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
     Of nature's oracle--first love,--that all
     Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.
     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
       Nor offer'd any; she had never heard
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
       Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
     And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
     Had not one word to say of constancy.
     She loved, and was beloved--she adored,
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
       If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,--
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
     And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
     Felt as if never more to beat apart.
     Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
       So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
     Was that in which the heart is always full,
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
     Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving
     Pleasure or pain to one another living.
     Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
       So loving and so lovely--till then never,
     Excepting our first parents, such a pair
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
     And hell and purgatory--but forgot
     Just in the very crisis she should not.
     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
     Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
     And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
     Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.
     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
     And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
     Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.
     An infant when it gazes on a light,
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
     A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
       A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
     Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
     As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.
     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
       Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
     There lies the thing we love with all its errors
     And all its charms, like death without its terrors.
     The lady watch'd her lover--and that hour
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;
       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
     She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
     And all the stars that crowded the blue space
     Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.
     Alas! the love of women! it is known
       To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
     For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
       And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
     To them but mockeries of the past alone,
       And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
     Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
     Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.
     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
       Is always so to women; one sole bond
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
       Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.
     Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
       Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
     Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
     From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.
     Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
     Made but to love, to feel that she was his
       Who was her chosen: what was said or done
     Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,
     Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.
     And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
       How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
     Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
     So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.
     And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
       Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     And they were happy, for to their young eyes
     Each was an angel, and earth paradise.
     O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
       Titus the master, Antony the slave,
     Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
       Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
       (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--
     O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
     For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.
     Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
       And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
     Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
       Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
     Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
     They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.
     Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
       And Aristippus, a material crew!
     Who to immoral courses would allure us
       By theories quite practicable too;
     If only from the devil they would insure us,
       How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
     'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.
     But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
     I can't but say it seems to me most truly
       Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
     Does these things for us, and whenever newly
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     Else how the devil is it that fresh features
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?
     I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
       No permanent foundation can be laid;
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
     I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
     Which gave me some sensations like a villain.
     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
     'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,
       'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
     I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
       Or neither--out of curiosity.'
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
     (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);
     'Stop!' so I stopp'd.--But to return: that which
       Men call inconstancy is nothing more
     Than admiration due where nature's rich
       Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
       A lovely statue we almost adore,
     This sort of adoration of the real
     Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'
     'T is the perception of the beautiful,
       A fine extension of the faculties,
     Platonic, universal, wonderful,
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
     Without which life would be extremely dull;
       In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
     With one or two small senses added, just
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.
     Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
       For surely if we always could perceive
     In the same object graces quite as killing
       As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
     'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
       (For we must get them any how or grieve),
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
     How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!
     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
       But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
     Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
       And darkness and destruction as on high:
     But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,
       Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
     Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
     Which make the English climate of our years.
     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
       But very rarely executes its function,
     For the first passion stays there such a while,
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,--
       Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,--
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'
     In the mean time, without proceeding more
       In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
       That being about the number I 'll allow
     Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     For them and theirs with all who deign to read.
[Illustration: Canto 3]
   Hail, Muse! et cetera.--We left Juan sleeping,
       Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,
     And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
     To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
       Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!
     O, Love! what is it in this world of ours
       Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why
     With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
     As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
       And place them on their breast--but place to die--
     Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
     Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.
     In her first passion woman loves her lover,
       In all the others all she loves is love,
     Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
       And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
       One man alone at first her heart can move;
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     Not finding that the additions much encumber.
     I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
     Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
       Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
     Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
     But those who have ne'er end with only one.
     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
     That love and marriage rarely can combine,
       Although they both are born in the same clime;
     Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--
       A sad, sour, sober beverage--by time
     Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour
     Down to a very homely household savour.
     There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
       Between their present and their future state;
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       Is used until the truth arrives too late--
     Yet what can people do, except despair?
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
     For instance--passion in a lover 's glorious,
     But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.
     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
       They sometimes also get a little tired
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       The same things cannot always be admired,
     Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
     Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
     Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.
     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
       Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;
     Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
       But only give a bust of marriages;
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
     He would have written sonnets all his life?
     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
     The future states of both are left to faith,
       For authors fear description might disparage
     The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
     They say no more of Death or of the Lady.
     The only two that in my recollection
       Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
     Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
       Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
       (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):
     But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
     Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.
     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
       By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,
     Although my opinion may require apology,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
     Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
       Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
     I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
     Meant to personify the mathematics.
     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
       The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
     Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
       The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
     Before the consequences grow too awful;
     'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.
     Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit
       Indulgence of their innocent desires;
     But more imprudent grown with every visit,
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
     Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
     Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.
     Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
       Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
     For into a prime minister but change
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
     Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
     And merely practised as a sea-attorney.
     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
       By winds and waves, and some important captures;
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
       Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,
     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
       His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
     In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
     And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.
     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
       Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
       Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
     The rest--save here and there some richer one,
       Reserved for future ransom--in the hold
     Were link'd alike, as for the common people he
     Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.
     The merchandise was served in the same way,
       Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;
     Except some certain portions of the prey,
       Light classic articles of female want,
     French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
       Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
     All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
     Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.
     A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,
       Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
     He chose from several animals he saw--
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.
     Then having settled his marine affairs,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
     His vessel having need of some repairs,
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
     Continued still her hospitable cares;
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.
     And there he went ashore without delay,
       Having no custom-house nor quarantine
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
       About the time and place where he had been:
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
       With orders to the people to careen;
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.
     Arriving at the summit of a hill
       Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,
     He stopp'd.--What singular emotions fill
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
     And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.
     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     Most naturally some small doubt inspires--
       A female family 's a serious matter
     (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
     And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.
     An honest gentleman at his return
       May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
     Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
       Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
       To his memory--and two or three young misses
     Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,--
     And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.
     If single, probably his plighted fair
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
     But all the better, for the happy pair
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
     He may resume his amatory care
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
     Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.
     And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
       Some chaste liaison of the kind--I mean
     An honest friendship with a married lady--
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     To last--of all connections the most steady,
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)--
     Yet for all that keep not too long away,
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.
     Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
       Much less experience of dry land than ocean,
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
       Or that of any other strong emotion;
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.
     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
     Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes
     Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.
     And as the spot where they appear he nears,
       Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
     He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
       But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
     A melody which made him doubt his ears,
       The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
     A most unoriental roar of laughter.
     And still more nearly to the place advancing,
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
     Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
       'Midst other indications of festivity,
     Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
       Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
     Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
     To which the Levantines are very partial.
     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
       Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
     Their leader sang--and bounded to her song,
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.
     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
       And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.
     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
     While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,
       The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
     His sober head, majestically tame,
       Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
     His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
     Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.
     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
       Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
     Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
       The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
       Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
     So that the philosophical beholder
     Sigh'd for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.
     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
       To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
     Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
       Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).
     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
       For the imagination or the senses,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
       Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
     Dreading that climax of all human ills,
     The inflammation of his weekly bills.
     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
       The happiest mortals even after dinner--
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
       Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;
     Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,
       That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
     Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
     Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.
     He--being a man who seldom used a word
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
     (In general he surprised men with the sword)
       His daughter--had not sent before to advise
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
     In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
     To find so much good company invited.
     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
       That a report (especially the Greeks)
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
       And put his house in mourning several weeks,--
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
       The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
     Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
     She now kept house upon her own account.
     Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
       Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
     The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
       Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
     'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
     While she had not one hour to spare from loving.
     Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
       Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
       To teach his people to be more exact,
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.
     You 're wrong.--He was the mildest manner'd man
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
     With such true breeding of a gentleman,
       You never could divine his real thought;
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
       Gird more deceit within a petticoat;
     Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
     He was so great a loss to good society.
     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
     His question, much too merry to divine
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,
     And without turning his facetious head,
       Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
     Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
       You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'
     'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!--pooh!-
     You mean our master--not the old, but new.'
     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
       They thus address'd--and Lambro's visage fell--
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
     The expression, and endeavouring to resume
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.
     'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what
       He is, nor whence he came--and little care;
     But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
     And if you are not satisfied with that,
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'
     I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
       And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,
     Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,
       E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
       His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
     Who all the time was eating up his mutton.
     Now in a person used to much command--
       To bid men come, and go, and come again--
     To see his orders done, too, out of hand--
       Whether the word was death, or but the chain--
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       Yet such things are, which I can not explain,
     Though doubtless he who can command himself
     Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.
     Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
     With him it never was a word and blow,
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     And his one blow left little work for two.
     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
       On to the house, but by a private way,
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
       So little they expected him that day;
     If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
       For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,
     But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
     This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.
     If all the dead could now return to life
       (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,
     For instance, if a husband or his wife
       (Nuptial examples are as good as any),
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
       The present weather would be much more rainy--
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
     Would share most probably its resurrection.
     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
     To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
     The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
     Beyond a single gentleman's belief.
     He enter'd in the house--his home no more,
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
     The solitude of passing his own door
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
     Over the innocence of that sweet child,
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.
     He was a man of a strange temperament,
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
     Moderate in all his habits, and content
       With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
     Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant
       For something better, if not wholly good;
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.
     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.
     But something of the spirit of old Greece
       Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
       His predecessors in the Colchian days;
     T is true he had no ardent love for peace--
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.
     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
       Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,--
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
     Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
     Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.
     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
       Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
     His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
     And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.
     The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
       Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
     The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
       Is awful to the vessel near the rock;
     But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
       Their fury being spent by its own shock,
     Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire
     Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.
     It is a hard although a common case
       To find our children running restive--they
     In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
       Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
     But in good company--the gout or stone.
     Yet a fine family is a fine thing
       (Provided they don't come in after dinner);
     'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
     Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
       To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).
     A lady with her daughters or her nieces
     Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.
     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
       Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
     Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,
     Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.
     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
       Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,
     And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
       Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,
     Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
       The beverage was various sherbets
     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.
     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
     And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
       In small fine China cups, came in at last;
     Gold cups of filigree made to secure
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
     Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd
     Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.
     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       And round them ran a yellow border too;
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
       Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,
     Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
     From poets, or the moralists their betters.
     These Oriental writings on the wall,
       Quite common in those countries, are a kind
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
     Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.
     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
       A genius who has drunk himself to death,
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
       (For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)--
     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
       Are things that really take away the breath,--
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
     To do not much less damage than the table.
     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
       Of the apartment--and appear'd quite new;
     The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
       Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
     Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.
     Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
       Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
     And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
     To say, by degradation) mingled there
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.
     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
       Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
     Fretted with gold or silver:--by command,
       The greater part of these were ready spread
     With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.
     Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:
       She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;
     Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
     With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.
     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
       Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     So beautiful--its very shape would charm;
       And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.
     Around, as princess of her father's land,
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.
     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
       Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun
     Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
       The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.
     Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--
       Too pure even for the purest human ties;
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     It would not be idolatry to kneel.
     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
     The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for
     They could not look more rosy than before.
     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
     She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
       She was so like a vision; I might err,
     But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'
     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
       But a white baracan, and so transparent
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
       Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
       An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't
     Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,
     Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.
     And now they were diverted by their suite,
       Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
     Which made their new establishment complete;
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
       And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'
     He praised the present, and abused the past,
       Reversing the good custom of old days,
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise--
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
       By his seeming independent in his lays,
     But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
     With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.
     He was a man who had seen many changes,
       And always changed as true as any needle;
     His polar star being one which rather ranges,
       And not the fix'd--he knew the way to wheedle:
     So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
       And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
     He lied with such a fervour of intention--
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.
     But he had genius,--when a turncoat has it,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
       Even good men like to make the public stare:--
     But to my subject--let me see--what was it?-
       O!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
     Of living in their insular abode.
     Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
       In company a very pleasant fellow,
     Had been the favourite of full many a mess
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.
     But now being lifted into high society,
       And having pick'd up several odds and ends
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
       He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
     That, without any danger of a riot, he
       Might for long lying make himself amends;
     And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
     Agree to a short armistice with truth.
     He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
     And having lived with people of all ranks,
       Had something ready upon most occasions--
     Which got him a few presents and some thanks.
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.
     Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     'T was all the same to him--'God save the king,'
       Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:
     His muse made increment of any thing,
       From the high lyric down to the low rational:
     If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?
     In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
       In England a six canto quarto tale;
     In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
       The last war--much the same in Portugal;
     In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
       Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);
     In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
     In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:
                     THE ISLES OF GREECE.
           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
           Eternal summer gilds them yet,
           But all, except their sun, is set.
           The Scian and the Teian muse,
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
             Their place of birth alone is mute
           To sounds which echo further west
           Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'
           The mountains look on Marathon--
             And Marathon looks on the sea;
           And musing there an hour alone,
             I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
           For standing on the Persians' grave,
           I could not deem myself a slave.
           A king sate on the rocky brow
             Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
             And men in nations;--all were his!
           He counted them at break of day--
           And when the sun set where were they?
           And where are they? and where art thou,
             My country? On thy voiceless shore
           The heroic lay is tuneless now--
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
           And must thy lyre, so long divine,
           Degenerate into hands like mine?
           'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
             Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
             Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
           For what is left the poet here?
           For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.
           Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
             Must we but blush?--Our fathers bled.
           Earth! render back from out thy breast
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
           To make a new Thermopylae!
           What, silent still? and silent all?
             Ah! no;--the voices of the dead
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
             And answer, 'Let one living head,
           But one arise,--we come, we come!'
           'T is but the living who are dumb.
           In vain--in vain: strike other chords;
             Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
           Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
             And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call--
           How answers each bold Bacchanal!
           You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
           Of two such lessons, why forget
             The nobler and the manlier one?
           You have the letters Cadmus gave--
           Think ye he meant them for a slave?
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             We will not think of themes like these!
           It made Anacreon's song divine:
             He served--but served Polycrates--
           A tyrant; but our masters then
           Were still, at least, our countrymen.
           The tyrant of the Chersonese
             Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
           That tyrant was Miltiades!
             O! that the present hour would lend
           Another despot of the kind!
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
           Exists the remnant of a line
             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
           And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
           The Heracleidan blood might own.
           Trust not for freedom to the Franks--
             They have a king who buys and sells;
           In native swords, and native ranks,
             The only hope of courage dwells;
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
           Would break your shield, however broad.
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
           I see their glorious black eyes shine;
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
           My own the burning tear-drop laves,
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves
           Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
             Where nothing, save the waves and I,
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
           A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--
           Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!
     Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
     If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
       Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
     His strain display'd some feeling--right or wrong;
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.
     But words are things, and a small drop of ink,
       Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
     That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
       'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
     Instead of speech, may form a lasting link
       Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
     Frail man, when paper--even a rag like this,
     Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.
     And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
       His station, generation, even his nation,
     Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
       In chronological commemoration,
     Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,
       Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
     In digging the foundation of a closet,
     May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.
     And glory long has made the sages smile;
       'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--
     Depending more upon the historian's style
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
     Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:
       The present century was growing blind
     To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,
     Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.
     Milton 's the prince of poets--so we say;
       A little heavy, but no less divine:
     An independent being in his day--
       Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
       We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine
     Was whipt at college--a harsh sire--odd spouse,
     For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.
     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
       Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
       Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);
     Like Cromwell's pranks;--but although truth exacts
       These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
     As most essential to their hero's story,
     They do not much contribute to his glory.
     All are not moralists, like Southey, when
       He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
     Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then
       Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;
     Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen
       Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;
     When he and Southey, following the same path,
     Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).
     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
       The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
     Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
       Are good manure for their more bare biography.
     Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger
       Than any since the birthday of typography;
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
     Writ in a manner which is my aversion.
     He there builds up a formidable dyke
       Between his own and others' intellect;
     But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
       Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,
     Are things which in this century don't strike
       The public mind,--so few are the elect;
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.
     But let me to my story: I must own,
       If I have any fault, it is digression--
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
       While I soliloquize beyond expression;
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
       Which put off business to the ensuing session:
     Forgetting each omission is a loss to
     The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.
     I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
       (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing
     In that complete perfection which ensures
       An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
     Form not the true temptation which allures
       The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
     To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.
     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'
       We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,--
     To show with what complacency he creeps,
       With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps--
       Of ocean?--No, of air; and then he makes
     Another outcry for 'a little boat,'
     And drivels seas to set it well afloat.
     If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
     Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
       Or pray Medea for a single dragon?
     Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
     Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?
     'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades
       Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
     That trash of such sort not alone evades
       Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
     Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss--
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!
     T' our tale.--The feast was over, the slaves gone,
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;--
     Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!
     Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!
       The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
       Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,
     While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,
       Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,
     And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.
     Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
       Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!
     Ave Maria! may our spirits dare
       Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
     Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
       Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove--
     What though 't is but a pictured image?--strike--
     That painting is no idol,--'t is too like.
     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
       In nameless print--that I have no devotion;
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
       My altars are the mountains and the ocean,
     Earth, air, stars,--all that springs from the great Whole,
     Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.
     Sweet hour of twilight!--in the solitude
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
       Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,
     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
       Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
     And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,
     How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!
     The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,
       Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
     Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
     The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
     Which learn'd from this example not to fly
     From a true lover,--shadow'd my mind's eye.
     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things--
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
       The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
     Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
       Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
     Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.
     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!
     When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
       Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,
     Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
     Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.
     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
       Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
     To do with the transactions of my hero,
       More than such madmen's fellow man--the moon's?
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     To dub the last of honours in degrees).
     I feel this tediousness will never do--
       'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
     (In copying) this long canto into two;
       They 'll never find it out, unless I own
     The fact, excepting some experienced few;
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
     I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
     From Aristotle passim.--See poietikes.
   Nothing so difficult as a beginning
       In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
     For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;
       Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
     Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
     Till our own weakness shows us what we are.
     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
     Man,--and, as we would hope,--perhaps the devil,
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
     While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
       We know not this--the blood flows on too fast;
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     We ponder deeply on each past emotion.
     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
     Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow
       Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,
     And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
     Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.
     And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
       'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
     'T is that our nature cannot always bring
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,
       Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.
     Some have accused me of a strange design
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
     And trace it in this poem every line:
       I don't pretend that I quite understand
     My own meaning when I would be very fine;
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
     Unless it were to be a moment merry,
     A novel word in my vocabulary.
     To the kind reader of our sober clime
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
     Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,
       Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:
     But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
     I chose a modern subject as more meet.
     How I have treated it, I do not know;
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me
     Who have imputed such designs as show
       Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
     And tells me to resume my story here.
     Young Juan and his lady-love were left
       To their own hearts' most sweet society;
     Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,
       Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
     Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,
     Before one charm or hope had taken wing.
     Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
       Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
     The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
       But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
     Was not for them--they had too little day.
     They were alone once more; for them to be
       Thus was another Eden; they were never
     Weary, unless when separate: the tree
       Cut from its forest root of years--the river
     Damm'd from its fountain--the child from the knee
       And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,--
     Would wither less than these two torn apart;
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart--
     The heart--which may be broken: happy they!
       Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
       And all which must be borne, and never told;
     While life's strange principle will often lie
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.
     'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
       And many deaths do they escape by this:
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more--
       The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,
     Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave
     Which men weep over may be meant to save.
     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead--
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     Each was the other's mirror, and but read
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.
     The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
       The least glance better understood than words,
     Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
       A language, too, but like to that of birds,
     Known but to them, at least appearing such
       As but to lovers a true sense affords;
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,--
     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
       And children still they should have ever been;
     They were not made in the real world to fill
       A busy character in the dull scene,
     But like two beings born from out a rill,
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
     To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
     And never know the weight of human hours.
     Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
     For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys
     Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.
     O beautiful! and rare as beautiful
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
     Whose husband only knows her not a wh--re.
     Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
       Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,
     Who never found a single hour too slow,
       What was it made them thus exempt from care?
     Young innate feelings all have felt below,
       Which perish in the rest, but in them were
     Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,
     And always envy, though we deem it frantic.
     This is in others a factitious state,
       An opium dream of too much youth and reading,
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,
     For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,
       And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
     So that there was no reason for their loves
     More than for those of nightingales or doves.
     They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
       Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
     For it had made them what they were: the power
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
     When happiness had been their only dower,
       And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
     Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought
     The past still welcome as the present thought.
     I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
       Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
     When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
     And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
     While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.
     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
     As if their last day! of a happy date
       With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
     For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.
     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
       Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:
     Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
     When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--
     'If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--
     Or I at least shall not survive to see.'
     Juan would question further, but she press'd
       His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
     And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
       Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;
     I have tried both; so those who would a part take
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.
     One of the two, according to your choice,
       Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
       But which to choose, I really hardly know;
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
       For both sides I could many reasons show,
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     It were much better to have both than neither.
     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
       With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,
     Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,
       All that the best can mingle and express
     When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,
       And love too much, and yet can not love less;
     But almost sanctify the sweet excess
     By the immortal wish and power to bless.
     Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
       Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
       Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
       For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
     Love was born with them, in them, so intense,
     It was their very spirit--not a sense.
     They should have lived together deep in woods,
       Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were
     Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
       Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:
     How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
     Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.
     Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
       For ever and anon a something shook
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.
     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
       The mystical usurper of the mind--
     O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
       Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.
     She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
       Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir
     She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
       Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
     And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
       Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were
     Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.
     Anon--she was released, and then she stray'd
       O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
     Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
       'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.
     The dream changed:--in a cave she stood, its walls
       Were hung with marble icicles, the work
     Of ages on its water-fretted halls,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
     Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.
     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
       Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
     Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
       Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
     Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
     Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.
     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
       Faded, or alter'd into something new--
     Like to her father's features, till each trace--
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
     O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
     'T is--'t is her father's--fix'd upon the pair!
     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
       Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
     It was a moment of that awful kind--
     I have seen such--but must not call to mind.
     Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,
       And caught her falling, and from off the wall
     Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak
       Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
     Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
     Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'
     And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is--
       'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--
     He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.
       O! dearest father, in this agony
     Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss
       Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
     That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
     Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'
     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
       Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--
     Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
       He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
     In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
     On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.
     'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
       And drawing from his belt a pistol, he
     Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
     'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--
     And next proceeded quietly to cock.
     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
     A moment more will bring the sight to bear
       Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
       If you have got a former friend for foe;
     But after being fired at once or twice,
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.
     Lambro presented, and one instant more
       Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
     When Haidee threw herself her boy before;
       Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death
     Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore
       He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
     I love him--I will die with him: I knew
     Your nature's firmness--know your daughter's too.'
     A minute past, and she had been all tears,
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears--
       Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;
     And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
       She drew up to her height, as if to show
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
     Her father's face--but never stopp'd his hand.
     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
       How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
     Serenely savage, with a little change
       In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       If cause should be--a lioness, though tame.
     Her father's blood before her father's face
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.
     I said they were alike, their features and
       Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
     Even to the delicacy of their hand
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
       In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears
     And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
     Show what the passions are in their full growth.
     The father paused a moment, then withdrew
       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
     And looking on her, as to look her through,
       'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;
     Not I have made this desolation: few
       Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
     But I must do my duty--how thou hast
     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.
     'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
       And blew; another answer'd to the call,
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
       And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,
     Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
     He gave the word,--'Arrest or slay the Frank.'
     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
     'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
       In vain she struggled in her father's grasp--
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
       Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
     The file of pirates; save the foremost, who
     Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.
     The second had his cheek laid open; but
       The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
       His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
       With the blood running like a little brook
     From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red--
     One on the arm, the other on the head.
     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
       Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.
     They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
       Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;
     On board of one of these, and under hatches,
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.
     The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
       And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
     A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
       Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,
     Just at the very time when he least broods
       On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,
     Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,
     And all because a lady fell in love.
     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
       Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!
     Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
       For if my pure libations exceed three,
     I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
       That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
     'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
     For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,
     Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
     Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
     I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack
       (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
     My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
     Wakes me next morning with its synonym.
     I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--
       Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
     Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.
     There the large olive rains its amber store
       In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
     Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
     Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
     And as the soil is, so the heart of man.
     Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
     For good or evil, burning from its birth,
       The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
     And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
       Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
     Though sleeping like a lion near a source.
     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     Till slowly charged with thunder they display
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
     The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
     Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.
     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
       And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
     His blood was running on the very floor
       Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,--
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.
     A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
     And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
       O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore
     Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     But she defied all means they could employ,
     Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.
     Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
     Corruption came not in each mind to kill
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul--
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.
     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,
     But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws
       O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;
     O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.
     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
       Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
       Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     For, for a while, the furies made a pause.
     She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
       On many a token without knowing what;
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh
       Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat
     Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave
     No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.
     Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
       However dear or cherish'd in their day;
     They changed from room to room--but all forgot--
       Gentle, but without memory she lay;
     At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
     Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.
     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
       Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
     And he begun a long low island song
     Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.
     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
       In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.
     Short solace, vain relief!--thought came too quick,
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
     As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
     But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
       Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;--
     Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
     Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.
     Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;
       Nothing could make her meet her father's face,
     Though on all other things with looks intense
       She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
     Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
       Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
     Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
     Senses to sleep--the power seem'd gone for ever.
     Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     The very instant, till the change that cast
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
     Glazed o'er her eyes--the beautiful, the black--
     O! to possess such lustre--and then lack!
     She died, but not alone; she held within
       A second principle of life, which might
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
       But closed its little being without light,
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
     In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
     The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.
     Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her
       Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made
     Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
       Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
     By age in earth: her days and pleasures were
       Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid
     Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.
     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     None but her own and father's grave is there,
       And nothing outward tells of human clay;
     Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
       No stone is there to show, no tongue to say
     What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,
     Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.
     But many a Greek maid in a loving song
       Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
       Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:
     If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong--
       A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
     In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.
     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
       And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
     I don't much like describing people mad,
       For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself--
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
       And as my Muse is a capricious elf,
     We 'll put about, and try another tack
     With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.
     Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
     Could altogether call the past to mind;
       And when he did, he found himself at sea,
     Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee--
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.
     There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
       (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
     Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
     And further downward, tall and towering still, is
       The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus--
     All heroes, who if living still would slay us.
     High barrows, without marble or a name,
       A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     The situation seems still form'd for fame--
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
     With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
     The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;
     Troops of untended horses; here and there
       Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
       A moment at the European youth
     Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
       A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
     Extremely taken with his own religion,
     Are what I found there--but the devil a Phrygian.
     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
       From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;
     Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
       A few brief questions; and the answers gave
     No very satisfactory information
     About his past or present situation.
     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;
     From them, at least, their destiny he heard,
       Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
     In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
       In their vocation) had not been attack'd
     In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.
     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     For although destined to the Turkish mart, he
       Still kept his spirits up--at least his face;
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
       And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
     Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
     Than did the prima donna and the tenor.
     In a few words he told their hapless story,
       Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,
     Making a signal off some promontory,
       Hail'd a strange brig--Corpo di Caio Mario!
     We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,
       Without a Single scudo of salario;
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     We will revive our fortunes before long.
     'The prima donna, though a little old,
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
       Last carnival she made a deal of strife
     By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
     From an old Roman princess at Bologna.
     'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
     Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
       She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
     And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     And then there 's the Grotesca--such a dancer!
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.
     'As for the figuranti, they are like
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
       Yet has a sentimental kind of air
     Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.
     'As for the men, they are a middling set;
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
     But being qualified in one way yet,
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
     And as a servant some preferment get;
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
     From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex
     To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.
     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     In fact, he had no singing education,
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
     But being the prima donna's near relation,
       Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
     They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
     An ass was practising recitative.
     ''T would not become myself to dwell upon
       My own merits, and though young--I see, Sir--you
     Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?--I 'm the man;
       The time may come when you may hear me too;
     You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,
     But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there--do go.
     'Our baritone I almost had forgot,
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     With graceful action, science not a jot,
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     He always is complaining of his lot,
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
     In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
     Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'
     Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
       Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
     Who came at stated moments to invite all
       The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
       From the blue skies derived a double blue,
     Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.
     They heard next day--that in the Dardanelles,
       Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
     The most imperative of sovereign spells,
       Which every body does without who can,
     More to secure them in their naval cells,
       Lady to lady, well as man to man,
     Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
     For the slave market of Constantinople.
     It seems when this allotment was made out,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
     Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
       If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
     They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
       Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
     Was Juan,--who, an awkward thing at his age,
     Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.
     With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
       With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
     Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
       Instead of bearing up without debate,
     That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
     'Arcades ambo,' id est--blackguards both.
     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
       But bred within the March of old Ancona,
     With eyes that look'd into the very soul
       (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
     Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     Great wish to please--a most attractive dower,
     Especially when added to the power.
     But all that power was wasted upon him,
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
     Touch'd his, nor that--nor any handsome limb
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.
     No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
     And firmer faith no ladye--love desire;
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
     'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
       By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,
     I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
     Was more triumphant, and not much less real.
     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
       Having withstood temptation in my youth,
     But hear that several people take exception
       At the first two books having too much truth;
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
       Because the publisher declares, in sooth,
     Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.
     'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
     Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
       Who say strange things for so correct an age;
     I once had great alacrity in wielding
       My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
     And recollect the time when all this cant
     Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.
     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
       But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:
       Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease
     While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
       Or of some centuries to take a lease,
     The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.
     Of poets who come down to us through distance
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
       From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
     Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
     But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.
     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.
     The very generations of the dead
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     Until the memory of an age is fled,
       And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
       Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
     Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
     And lose their own in universal death.
     I canter by the spot each afternoon
       Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
     Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
       For human vanity, the young De Foix!
     A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
       But which neglect is hastening to destroy,
     Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
     While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.
     I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid
       To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
       The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,
     Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,
     Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.
     With human blood that column was cemented,
       With human filth that column is defiled,
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
       To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:
     Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
     Instinct of gore and glory earth has known
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.
     Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
       Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
     Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
     Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.
     If in the course of such a life as was
       At once adventurous and contemplative,
     Men, who partake all passions as they pass,
       Acquire the deep and bitter power to give
     Their images again as in a glass,
       And in such colours that they seem to live;
     You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.
     O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
       Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
     Who advertise new poems by your looks,
       Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?
     What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
       Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
     Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!
     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
       A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
     To bear the compliments of many a bore,
       And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
       (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.
     O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
     And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     I have examined few pair of that hue);
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.
     Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures--
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
     You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
       And--but no matter, all those things are over;
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
       For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
     I knew one woman of that purple school,
     The loveliest, chastest, best, but--quite a fool.
     Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
     Invented, by some name I have forgot,
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     An airy instrument, with which he sought
       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!
     But to the narrative:--The vessel bound
       With slaves to sell off in the capital,
     After the usual process, might be found
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
       Were landed in the market, one and all,
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.
     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
       For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
     Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
     Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
       Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;
     But when the offer went beyond, they knew
     'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
     Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
       Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;
     Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
       What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
     Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
       Is always much more splendid than a king:
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     Are saving--vice spares nothing for a rarity.
     But for the destiny of this young troop,
       How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
     How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
       And others rose to the command of crews
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
       Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:
     All this must be reserved for further song;
       Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant
     (Because this Canto has become too long),
       Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
     I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
       But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.
[Illustration: Canto 5]
   When amatory poets sing their loves
       In liquid lines mellifluously bland,
     And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,
       They little think what mischief is in hand;
     The greater their success the worse it proves,
       As Ovid's verse may give to understand;
     Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,
     Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.
     I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,
       Except in such a way as not to attract;
     Plain--simple--short, and by no means inviting,
       But with a moral to each error tack'd,
     Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,
       And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
     Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,
     This poem will become a moral model.
     The European with the Asian shore
       Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream
     Here and there studded with a seventy-four;
       Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;
     The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;
       The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,
     Far less describe, present the very view
     Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.
     I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'
       For once it was a magic sound to me;
     And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
       Where I beheld what never was to be;
     All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
       A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
     But I grow sad--and let a tale grow cold,
     Which must not be pathetically told.
     The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
       Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
     'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
       To watch the progress of those rolling seas
     Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
       Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
     There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
     Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.
     'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
       When nights are equal, but not so the days;
     The Parcae then cut short the further spinning
       Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
     The waters, and repentance for past sinning
       In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:
     They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
     Because if drown'd, they can't--if spared, they won't.
     A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
       And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;
     Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
       Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.
     All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,
       From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
     The negroes more philosophy display'd,--
     Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.
     Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,
       As most at his age are, of hope and health;
     Yet I must own he looked a little dull,
       And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;
     Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
       His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
     A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,
     To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,
     Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,
       Upon the whole his carriage was serene:
     His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
       Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
     Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
       He was above the vulgar by his mien;
     And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
     And then--they calculated on his ransom.
     Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
       With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,
     Though rather more irregularly spotted:
       Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
     It chanced amongst the other people lotted,
       A man of thirty rather stout and hale,
     With resolution in his dark grey eye,
     Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.
     He had an English look; that is, was square
       In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,
     Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,
       And, it might be from thought or toil or study,
     An open brow a little mark'd with care:
       One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;
     And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
     Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.
     But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
       Of a high spirit evidently, though
     At present weigh'd down by a doom which had
       O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
     A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
       Lot of so young a partner in the woe,
     Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse
     Than any other scrape, a thing of course.
     'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew
       Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,
     All ragamuffins differing but in hue,
       With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,
     The only gentlemen seem I and you;
       So let us be acquainted, as we ought:
     If I could yield you any consolation,
     'T would give me pleasure.--Pray, what is your nation?'
     When Juan answer'd--'Spanish!' he replied,
       'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;
     Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
       Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,
     But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;
       But never mind,--she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;
     She has served me also much the same as you,
     Except that I have found it nothing new.'
     'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,
       What brought you here?'--'Oh! nothing very rare--
     Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'--'To this doom
       But what conducted, if the question's fair,
     Is that which I would learn.'--'I served for some
       Months with the Russian army here and there,
     And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
     A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'
     'Have you no friends?'--'I had--but, by God's blessing,
       Have not been troubled with them lately. Now
     I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,
       And you an equal courtesy should show.'
     'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
       And long besides.'--'Oh! if 't is really so,
     You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;
     A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.
     'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,
       Although a female moderately fickle,
     Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)
       For any length of days in such a pickle.
     To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife
       As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
     Men are the sport of circumstances, when
     The circumstances seem the sport of men.'
     ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom
       I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:'-
     He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
       A single tear upon his eyelash staid
     A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,
       'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
     Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
     Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,
     'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here
       He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
     'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear
       That there had been a lady in the case;
     And these are things which ask a tender tear,
       Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
     I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
     And also when my second ran away:
     'My third-'--'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;
       'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
     'No--only two at present above ground:
       Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
     One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
       'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?
     She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?'
     'No, faith.'--'What then?'--'I ran away from her.'
     'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
       Replied the other, 'what can a man do?
     There still are many rainbows in your sky,
       But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
     Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
       But time strips our illusions of their hue,
     And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
     Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.
     ''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,
       Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,
     This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
       Or sometimes only wear a week or two;--
     Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
       Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue
     The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
     Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'
     'All this is very fine, and may be true,'
       Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how
     It betters present times with me or you.'
       'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow
     By setting things in their right point of view,
       Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,
     We know what slavery is, and our disasters
     May teach us better to behave when masters.'
     'Would we were masters now, if but to try
       Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'
     Said Juan,--swallowing a heart-burning sigh:
       'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'
     'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'
       Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;
     Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)
     'But after all, what is our present state?
       'T is bad, and may be better--all men's lot:
     Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,
       To their own whims and passions, and what not;
     Society itself, which should create
       Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
     To feel for none is the true social art
     Of the world's stoics--men without a heart.'
     Just now a black old neutral personage
       Of the third sex stept up, and peering over
     The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,
       And capabilities, as to discover
     If they were fitted for the purposed cage:
       No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
     Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,
     Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,
     As is a slave by his intended bidder.
       'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
     And all are to be sold, if you consider
       Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
     Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,
       Some by a place--as tend their years or natures;
     The most by ready cash--but all have prices,
     From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.
     The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,
       Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid
     First but for one, and after for the pair;
       They haggled, wrangled, swore, too--so they did!
     As though they were in a mere Christian fair
       Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
     So that their bargain sounded like a battle
     For this superior yoke of human cattle.
     At last they settled into simple grumbling,
       And pulling out reluctant purses, and
     Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling
       Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
     And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,
       Until the sum was accurately scann'd,
     And then the merchant giving change, and signing
     Receipts in full, began to think of dining.
     I wonder if his appetite was good?
       Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
     Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
       And conscience ask a curious sort of question,
     About the right divine how far we should
       Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,
     I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
     Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.
     Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide
       Found life most tolerable after meals;
     He 's wrong--unless man were a pig, indeed,
       Repletion rather adds to what he feels,
     Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed
       From his own brain's oppression while it reels.
     Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather
     Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);
     I think with Alexander, that the act
       Of eating, with another act or two,
     Makes us feel our mortality in fact
       Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,
     And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
       Can give us either pain or pleasure, who
     Would pique himself on intellects, whose use
     Depends so much upon the gastric juice?
     The other evening ('t was on Friday last)--
       This is a fact and no poetic fable--
     Just as my great coat was about me cast,
       My hat and gloves still lying on the table,
     I heard a shot--'t was eight o'clock scarce past--
       And, running out as fast as I was able,
     I found the military commandant
     Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.
     Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,
       They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
     To perish on the pavement: so I had
       Him borne into the house and up the stair,
     And stripp'd and look'd to--But why should I ad
       More circumstances? vain was every care;
     The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel
     Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.
     I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
       And though I have seen many corpses, never
     Saw one, whom such an accident befell,
       So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
     He seem'd to sleep,--for you could scarcely tell
       (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
     Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
     So as I gazed on him, I thought or said--
     'Can this be death? then what is life or death?
       Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:--
     'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?
       A thousand warriors by his word were kept
     In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,
       "Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.
     The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb--
     And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'
     And they who waited once and worshipp'd--they
       With their rough faces throng'd about the bed
     To gaze once more on the commanding clay
       Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:
     And such an end! that he who many a day
       Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,--
     The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
     Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.
     The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
       Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
     And horrid was the contrast to the view--
       But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
     Perhaps even more attention than is due
       From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
     To try if I could wrench aught out of death
     Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;
     But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
       And there we go:--but where? five bits of lead,
     Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
       And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
     Can every element our elements mar?
       And air--earth--water--fire live--and we dead?
     We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
     But let us to the story as before.
     The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
       Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
     Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence
       As fast as oars could pull and water float;
     They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
       Wondering what next, till the caique was brought
     Up in a little creek below a wall
     O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.
     Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
       Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and
     He led them onward, first through a low thicket
       Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
     They almost lost their way, and had to pick it--
       For night was dosing ere they came to land.
     The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
     Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.
     As they were plodding on their winding way
       Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth
     (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
       There being no such profusion in the North
     Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'
       But that of late your scribblers think it worth
     Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
     Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)--
     As they were threading on their way, there came
       Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he
     Whisper'd to his companion:--'t was the same
       Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.
     'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame
       If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
     Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,
     And march away--'t were easier done than said.'
     'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?
       How get out? how the devil got we in?
     And when we once were fairly out, and when
       From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,
     To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
       And worse off than we hitherto have been;
     Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
     Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.
     'We must be near some place of man's abode;--
       For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
     With his two captives, by so queer a road,
       Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
     A single cry would bring them all abroad:
       'T is therefore better looking before leaping--
     And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
     By Jove, a noble palace!--lighted too.'
     It was indeed a wide extensive building
       Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front
     There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding
       And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,--
     A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in
       The arts of which these lands were once the font:
     Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
     New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.
     And nearer as they came, a genial savour
       Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
     Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
       Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
     And put himself upon his good behaviour:
       His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
     Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,
     And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'
     Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
       Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
     The last of these was never much the fashion,
       For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
     Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
       But more or less continue still to tease on,
     With arguments according to their 'forte;'
     But no one dreams of ever being short.-
     But I digress: of all appeals,--although
       I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
     Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,--no
       Method 's more sure at moments to take hold
     Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
       More tender, as we every day behold,
     Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
     The tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.
     Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
       And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
     No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
       Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
     Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
       And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
     And gazed around them to the left and right
     With the prophetic eye of appetite.
     And giving up all notions of resistance,
       They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
     Who little thought that his own crack'd existence
       Was on the point of being set aside:
     He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
       And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
     And a magnificent large hall display'd
     The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.
     I won't describe; description is my forte,
       But every fool describes in these bright days
     His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
       And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--
     Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
       While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
     Resigns herself with exemplary patience
     To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.
     Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
       Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;
     Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
       And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
     And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
       With amber mouths of greater price or less;
     And several strutted, others slept, and some
     Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.
     As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace
       Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
     A moment without slackening from their pace;
       But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:
     One or two stared the captives in the face,
       Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
     Some nodded to the negro from their station,
     But no one troubled him with conversation.
     He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
       On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
     Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,
       A marble fountain echoes through the glooms
     Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping
       Some female head most curiously presumes
     To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,
     As wondering what the devil a noise that is.
     Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
       Gave light enough to hint their farther way,
     But not enough to show the imperial halls,
       In all the flashing of their full array;
     Perhaps there 's nothing--I 'll not say appals,
       But saddens more by night as well as day,
     Than an enormous room without a soul
     To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.
     Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:
       In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
     There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
       The spots which were her realms for evermore;
     But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
       More modern buildings and those built of yore,
     A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
     Seeing what 's meant for many with but one.
     A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
       A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
     Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
       Are things which make an English evening pass;
     Though certes by no means so grand a sight
       As is a theatre lit up by gas.
     I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
     And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.
     Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
       I grant you in a church 't is very well:
     What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
       But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
     Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill--
       And huge tombs worse--mankind, since Adam fell:
     Methinks the story of the tower of Babel
     Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.
     Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then
       A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
     Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,
       Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
     And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
       The people's awe and admiration raising;
     'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,
     And the calumniated queen Semiramis.
     That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
       Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
     Of an improper friendship for her horse
       (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
     This monstrous tale had probably its source
       (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
     In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'
     I wish the case could come before a jury here.
     But to resume,--should there be (what may not
       Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,
     Because they can't find out the very spot
       Of that same Babel, or because they won't
     (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,
       And written lately two memoirs upon't),
     Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who
     Must be believed, though they believe not you,
     Yet let them think that Horace has exprest
       Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
     Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
       Who give themselves to architecture wholly;
     We know where things and men must end at best:
       A moral (like all morals) melancholy,
     And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
     Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.
     At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
       Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
     Though full of all things which could be desired,
       One wonder'd what to do with such a number
     Of articles which nobody required;
       Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
     With furniture an exquisite apartment,
     Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.
     It seem'd, however, but to open on
       A range or suite of further chambers, which
     Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one
       The movables were prodigally rich:
     Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
       So costly were they; carpets every stitch
     Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish
     You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.
     The black, however, without hardly deigning
       A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,
     Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,
       As if the milky way their feet was under
     With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
       A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder--
     In that remote recess which you may see--
     Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--
     I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,
       I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth
     A quantity of clothes fit for the back
       Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;
     And of variety there was no lack--
       And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,
     He chose himself to point out what he thought
     Most proper for the Christians he had bought.
     The suit he thought most suitable to each
       Was, for the elder and the stouter, first
     A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
       And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
     But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
       A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,
     Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;
     In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.
     While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,
       Hinted the vast advantages which they
     Might probably attain both in the end,
       If they would but pursue the proper way
     Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;
       And then he added, that he needs must say,
     ''T would greatly tend to better their condition,
     If they would condescend to circumcision.
     'For his own part, he really should rejoice
       To see them true believers, but no less
     Would leave his proposition to their choice.'
       The other, thanking him for this excess
     Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
       In such a trifle, scarcely could express
     'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
     Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.
     'For his own share--he saw but small objection
       To so respectable an ancient rite;
     And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
       For which he own'd a present appetite,
     He doubted not a few hours of reflection
       Would reconcile him to the business quite.'
     'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,
     But they as soon shall circumcise my head!
     'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'--'Now, pray,'
       Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:
     You put me out in what I had to say.
       Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supt,
     I shall perpend if your proposal may
       Be such as I can properly accept;
     Provided always your great goodness still
     Remits the matter to our own free-will.'
     Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good
       As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
     In which a Princess with great pleasure would
       Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
     As not being in a masquerading mood,
       Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
     And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
     Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'
     'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'
       Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:
     I have no more time nor many words to spare.'
       'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire
     The cause of this odd travesty?'--'Forbear,'
       Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,
     No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
     I have no authority to tell the reason.'
     'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'--'Hold!'
       Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;
     This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
       And you will find us not top fond of joking.'
     'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told
       That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking
     The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call
     Those who will leave you of no sex at all.
     'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:
       A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
     Why you should wear them.'--'What, though my soul loathes
       The effeminate garb?'--thus, after a short pause,
     Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,
       'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'
     Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace
     Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.
     And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
       A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;
     Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,
       Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;
     But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
       Which--as we say--or, as the Scotch say, whilk
     (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
     Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--
     Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to
       His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
     And yet at last he managed to get through
       His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
     The negro Baba help'd a little too,
       When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
     And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
     He paused, and took a survey up and down.
     One difficulty still remain'd--his hair
       Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
     So many false long tresses all to spare,
       That soon his head was most completely crown'd,
     After the manner then in fashion there;
       And this addition with such gems was bound
     As suited the ensemble of his toilet,
     While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.
     And now being femininely all array'd,
       With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,
     He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
       And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,
     A perfect transformation here display'd;
       And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
     That is--the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,
     Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.
     'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,
       'Will please to accompany those gentlemen
     To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,
       Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when
     I say a thing, it must at once be done.
       What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
     Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise
     Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.
     'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'
       'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;
     Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,
       Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
     I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm
       If any take me for that which I seem:
     So that I trust for everybody's sake,
     That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'
     'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
       Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
     Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
       Upon the metamorphosis in view,--
     'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
       Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
     One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
     By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'
     'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
       I wish you a good appetite.'--'Farewell!'
     Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;
       When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
     We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
       Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
     'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
     Unless his highness promises to marry me.
     And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
       Baba led Juan onward room by room
     Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
       Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
     Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
       And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
     It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,
     For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.
     The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
       Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
     Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
       Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
     There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
       And in perspective many a squadron flies:
     It seems the work of times before the line
     Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.
     This massy portal stood at the wide close
       Of a huge hall, and on its either side
     Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
       Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied
     In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
       O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
     The gate so splendid was in all its features,
     You never thought about those little creatures,
     Until you nearly trod on them, and then
       You started back in horror to survey
     The wondrous hideousness of those small men,
       Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,
     But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
       Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;
     They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--
     Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.
     Their duty was--for they were strong, and though
       They look'd so little, did strong things at times--
     To ope this door, which they could really do,
       The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
     And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
       As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
     To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;
     For mutes are generally used for that.
     They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;
       And looking like two incubi, they glared
     As Baba with his fingers made them fall
       To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
     Juan a moment, as this pair so small
       With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;
     It was as if their little looks could poison
     Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.
     Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint
       To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
     'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint
       That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
     'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)
       To swing a little less from side to side,
     Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--
     And also could you look a little modest,
     ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes
       Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;
     And if they should discover your disguise,
       You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
     And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
       To find our way to Marmora without boats,
     Stitch'd up in sacks--a mode of navigation
     A good deal practised here upon occasion.'
     With this encouragement, he led the way
       Into a room still nobler than the last;
     A rich confusion form'd a disarray
       In such sort, that the eye along it cast
     Could hardly carry anything away,
       Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;
     A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
     Magnificently mingled in a litter.
     Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things
       Occur in Orient palaces, and even
     In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings
       (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
     Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
       Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;
     Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,
     On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.
     In this imperial hall, at distance lay
       Under a canopy, and there reclined
     Quite in a confidential queenly way,
       A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd
     To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
       Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,
     What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended
     His head, until the ceremony ended.
     The lady rising up with such an air
       As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
     Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair
       Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
     And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
       She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
     Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,
     Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.
     Her presence was as lofty as her state;
       Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
     Whose force description only would abate:
       I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
     Than lessen it by what I could relate
       Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
     Could I do justice to the full detail;
     So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.
     Thus much however I may add,--her years
       Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;
     But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
       And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
     Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true--tears
       And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
     Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow
     Ugly; for instance--Ninon de l'Enclos.
     She spake some words to her attendants, who
       Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,
     And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
       Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;
     They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
       Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'
     As far as outward show may correspond;
     I won't be bail for anything beyond.
     They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
       But not by the same door through which came in
     Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,
       At some small distance, all he saw within
     This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
       Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;
     And I must say, I ne'er could see the very
     Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'
     'Not to admire is all the art I know
       (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)
     To make men happy, or to keep them so'
       (So take it in the very words of Creech)--
     Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;
       And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
     From his translation; but had none admired,
     Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?
     Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,
       Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then
     A second time desired him to kneel down,
       And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
     He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
       Drew himself up to his full height again,
     And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
     To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'
     Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
       Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
     He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
       About a bow-string--quite in vain; not yet
     Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
       There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
     In kingly chambers or imperial halls,
     As also at the race and county balls.
     He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
       About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
     The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords
       Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
     To stain his pedigree a thousand swords
       A thousand times of him had made an end;
     At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
     Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.
     Here was an honourable compromise,
       A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
     Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
       And Juan now his willingness exprest
     To use all fit and proper courtesies,
       Adding, that this was commonest and best,
     For through the South the custom still commands
     The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.
     And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
       Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers
     No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
       On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
     And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
       As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers
     In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
     An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.
     The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
       Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,
     As if well used to the retreating trade;
       And taking hints in good part all the while,
     He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
       And looking on him with a sort of smile,
     Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
     As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.
     When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
       I know not what might be the lady's thought,
     But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
       And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
     Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
       The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
     A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,
     Of half voluptuousness and half command.
     Her form had all the softness of her sex,
       Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
     When he put on the cherub to perplex
       Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;
     The sun himself was scarce more free from specks
       Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
     Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,
     As if she rather order'd than was granting.
     Something imperial, or imperious, threw
       A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain
     Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,--
       And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
     With aught which looks like despotism in view:
       Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain
     We would against them make the flesh obey--
     The spirit in the end will have its way.
     Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
       Her very nod was not an inclination;
     There was a self-will even in her small feet,
       As though they were quite conscious of her station--
     They trod as upon necks; and to complete
       Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
     A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign
     She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).
     'To hear and to obey' had been from birth
       The law of all around her; to fulfill
     All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
       Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;
     Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
       Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
     Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
     We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'
     Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
       Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed
     It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
       And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
     There was no end unto the things she bought,
       Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
     Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
     The women pardon'd all except her face.
     Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
       Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
     She order'd him directly to be bought,
       And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail
     In any kind of mischief to be wrought,
       At all such auctions knew how to prevail:
     She had no prudence, but he had; and this
     Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.
     His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
       And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,
     Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,
       This I must leave sultanas to decide:
     Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,
       And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
     As we may ascertain with due precision,
     Some by experience, others by tradition.
     But to the main point, where we have been tending:--
       She now conceived all difficulties past,
     And deem'd herself extremely condescending
       When, being made her property at last,
     Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending
       Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
     And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'
     Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move
     And so it was, in proper time and place;
       But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
     With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
       Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,
     Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,
       And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
     These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
     So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.
     She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
       For women shed and use them at their liking;
     But there is something when man's eye appears
       Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;
     A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
       Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
     His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
     To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.
     And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
       Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
     Infected her with sympathy till now,
       And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
     Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although
       There might arise some pouting petty care
     To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
     Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.
     But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
       And, when a strong although a strange sensation
     Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil
       For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,
     They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
       Samaritans in every situation;
     And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
     Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.
     But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
       Juan, who for an instant had been moved
     To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
       Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'
     Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone
       Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
     And although sensitive to beauty, he
     Felt most indignant still at not being free.
     Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,
       Was much embarrass'd, never having met
     In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
       And as she also risk'd her life to get
     Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
       Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,
     To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,
     And they had wasted now almost a quarter.
     I also would suggest the fitting time
       To gentlemen in any such like case,
     That is to say in a meridian clime--
       With us there is more law given to the chase,
     But here a small delay forms a great crime:
       So recollect that the extremest grace
     Is just two minutes for your declaration--
     A moment more would hurt your reputation.
     Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
       But he had got Haidee into his head:
     However strange, he could not yet forget her,
       Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.
     Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor
       For having had him to her palace led,
     Began to blush up to the eyes, and then
     Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.
     At length, in an imperial way, she laid
       Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
     Which needed not an empire to persuade,
       Look'd into his for love, where none replies:
     Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
       That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
     She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
     Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.
     This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
       But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
     With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
       And seated her all drooping by his side,
     Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
       And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
     'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor
     Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.
     'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof
       How much I have loved--that I love not thee!
     In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,
       Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!
     I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,
       Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;
     Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
     And hands obey--our hearts are still our own.'
     This was a truth to us extremely trite;
       Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:
     She deem'd her least command must yield delight,
       Earth being only made for queens and kings.
     If hearts lay on the left side or the right
       She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
     Legitimacy its born votaries, when
     Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.
     Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
       As even in a much humbler lot had made
     A kingdom or confusion anywhere,
       And also, as may be presumed, she laid
     Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
       By their possessors thrown into the shade:
     She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'
     And half of that opinion 's also mine.
     Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,
       Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,
     While some more desperate dowager has been waging
       Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung
     By your refusal, recollect her raging!
       Or recollect all that was said or sung
     On such a subject; then suppose the face
     Of a young downright beauty in this case.
     Suppose,--but you already have supposed,
       The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,
     Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed
       Of good examples; pity that so few by
     Poets and private tutors are exposed,
       To educate--ye youth of Europe--you by!
     But when you have supposed the few we know,
     You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.
     A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
       Or any interesting beast of prey,
     Are similes at hand for the distress
       Of ladies who can not have their own way;
     But though my turn will not be served with less,
       These don't express one half what I should say:
     For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
     To cutting short their hopes of having any?
     The love of offspring 's nature's general law,
       From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
     There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
       Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
     And all who have seen a human nursery, saw
       How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
     This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
     Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.
     If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
       'T were nothing--for her eyes flash'd always fire;
     Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
       I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
     So supernatural was her passion's rise;
       For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
     Even ye who know what a check'd woman is
     (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.
     Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--
       A moment's more had slain her; but the while
     It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
       Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,
     Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
       Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
     And the deep passions flashing through her form
     Made her a beautiful embodied storm.
     A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
       To match a common fury with her rage,
     And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
       Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
     Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
       Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age--
     Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
     And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.
     A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
       Pass'd without words--in fact she could not speak;
     And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
       A sentiment till then in her but weak,
     But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
       As water through an unexpected leak;
     For she felt humbled--and humiliation
     Is sometimes good for people in her station
     It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
       It also gently hints to them that others,
     Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;
       That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,
     And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
       Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:
     It teaches--Heaven knows only what it teaches,
     But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.
     Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
       Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;
     Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
       Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
     Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
       Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
     The lash to Baba:--but her grand resource
     Was to sit down again, and cry of course.
     She thought to stab herself, but then she had
       The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
     For Eastern stays are little made to pad,
       So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:
     She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!
       Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
     The cutting off his head was not the art
     Most likely to attain her aim--his heart.
     Juan was moved; he had made up his mind
       To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish
     For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,
       Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,
     And thus heroically stood resign'd,
       Rather than sin--except to his own wish:
     But all his great preparatives for dying
     Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.
     As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,
       So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
     And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
       And then, if matters could be made up now;
     And next his savage virtue he accused,
       Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
     Or as a dame repents her of her oath,
     Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.
     So he began to stammer some excuses;
       But words are not enough in such a matter,
     Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses
       Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
     Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;
       Just as a languid smile began to flatter
     His peace was making, but before he ventured
     Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.
     'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
       ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!
     Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,
       Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,
     Your slave brings tidings--he hopes not too soon--
       Which your sublime attention may be worth:
     The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
     To hint that he is coming up this way.'
     'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?
       I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!
     But bid my women form the milky way.
       Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--
     And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
       And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'
     Here they were interrupted by a humming
     Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'
     First came her damsels, a decorous file,
       And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
     The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
       His majesty was always so polite
     As to announce his visits a long while
       Before he came, especially at night;
     For being the last wife of the Emperour,
     She was of course the favorite of the four.
     His Highness was a man of solemn port,
       Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,
     Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,
       His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
     He was as good a sovereign of the sort
       As any mention'd in the histories
     Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine
     Save Solyman, the glory of their line.
     He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
       With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'
     He left to his vizier all state affairs,
       And show'd but little royal curiosity:
     I know not if he had domestic cares--
       No process proved connubial animosity;
     Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
     Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.
     If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,
       Little was heard of criminal or crime;
     The story scarcely pass'd a single lip--
       The sack and sea had settled all in time,
     From which the secret nobody could rip:
       The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;
     No scandals made the daily press a curse--
     Morals were better, and the fish no worse.
     He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
       Was also certain that the earth was square,
     Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found
       No sign that it was circular anywhere;
     His empire also was without a bound:
       'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
     By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,
     But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'
     Except in shape of envoys, who were sent
       To lodge there when a war broke out, according
     To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant
       Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
     Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
       Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
     Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or
     The singeing of a single inky whisker.
     He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
       Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
     The former in a palace, where like nuns
       They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
     When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
       Sometimes at six years old--though it seems odd,
     'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
     Must make a present to his sire in law.
     His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
       Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
     One or the other, but which of the two
       Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
     Meantime the education they went through
       Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:
     So that the heir apparent still was found
     No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.
     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
       With all the ceremonies of his rank,
     Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,
       As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;
     These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
       To save the credit of their breaking bank:
     To no men are such cordial greetings given
     As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.
     His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
       And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
     Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
       At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,
     But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
       While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,
     'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity
     That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'
     This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
       The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
     Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
       O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take
     Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
       Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
     There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
     But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.
     The Turks do well to shut--at least, sometimes--
       The women up, because, in sad reality,
     Their chastity in these unhappy climes
       Is not a thing of that astringent quality
     Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,
       And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
     The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
     Has quite the contrary effect on vice.
     Thus in the East they are extremely strict,
       And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
     Excepting only when the former 's pick'd
       It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
     Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
       But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
     Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
     Into that moral centaur, man and wife?
     Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
       Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
     According to the ancient epic laws,
       To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
     Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
       The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
     Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
     You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.
  'There is a tide in the affairs of men
       Which,--taken at the flood,'--you know the rest,
     And most of us have found it now and then;
       At least we think so, though but few have guess'd
     The moment, till too late to come again.
       But no doubt every thing is for the best--
     Of which the surest sign is in the end:
     When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.
     There is a tide in the affairs of women
       Which, taken at the flood, leads--God knows where:
     Those navigators must be able seamen
       Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;
     Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen
       With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
     Men with their heads reflect on this and that--
     But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!
     And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
       Young, beautiful, and daring--who would risk
     A throne, the world, the universe, to be
       Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk
     The stars from out the sky, than not be free
       As are the billows when the breeze is brisk--
     Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),
     Yet she would make full many a Manichean.
     Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset
       By commonest ambition, that when passion
     O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,
       Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
     If Antony be well remember'd yet,
       'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
     But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
     Outbalances all Caesar's victories.
     He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
       I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
     For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport--I
       Remember when, though I had no great plenty
     Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I
       Gave what I had--a heart: as the world went, I
     Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
     Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.
     'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
       Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;
     But whether such things do or do not weigh,
       All who have loved, or love, will still allow
     Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,
       And Love 's a god, or was before the brow
     Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears
     Of--but Chronology best knows the years.
     We left our hero and third heroine in
       A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
     For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin
       For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
     Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
       And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,
     Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
     Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.
     I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
       I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
     But I detest all fiction even in song,
       And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
     Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
       She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
     Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine
     Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.
     I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'
       But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
     If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,
       That, adding to the account his Highness' years,
     The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;
       For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
     She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
     Of what should be monopoly--the heart.
     It is observed that ladies are litigious
       Upon all legal objects of possession,
     And not the least so when they are religious,
       Which doubles what they think of the transgression:
     With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,
       As the tribunals show through many a session,
     When they suspect that any one goes shares
     In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.
     Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,
       The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,
     Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
       And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
     And for their rights connubial make a stand,
       When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:
     And as four wives must have quadruple claims,
     The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.
     Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)
       The favourite; but what 's favour amongst four?
     Polygamy may well be held in dread,
       Not only as a sin, but as a bore:
     Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,
       Will scarcely find philosophy for more;
     And all (except Mahometans) forbear
     To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'
     His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--
       So styled according to the usual forms
     Of every monarch, till they are consign'd
       To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,
     Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,--
       His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
     Expecting all the welcome of a lover
     (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).
     Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er
       Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
     May look like what is--neither here nor there,
       They are put on as easily as a hat,
     Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
       Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,
     Which form an ornament, but no more part
     Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.
     A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
       Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
     More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd
       Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,
     Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
       Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
     A sincere woman's breast,--for over-warm
     Or over-cold annihilates the charm.
     For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;
       If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;
     For no one, save in very early youth,
       Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,
     Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,
       And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer
     At a sad discount: while your over chilly
     Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.
     That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
       For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
     Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,
       And see a sentimental passion glow,
     Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
       In his monastic concubine of snow;--
     In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is
     Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'
     The 'tu' 's too much,--but let it stand,--the verse
       Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,
     And not the pink of old hexameters;
       But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time
     In the last line, which cannot well be worse,
       And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
     I own no prosody can ever rate it
     As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.
     If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
       I know not--it succeeded, and success
     Is much in most things, not less in the heart
       Than other articles of female dress.
     Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;
       They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
     And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
     Could stop that worst of vices--propagation.
     We leave this royal couple to repose:
       A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
     Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
       Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
     As any man's day mixture undergoes.
       Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;
     'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
     The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.
     A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
       To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
     At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
       A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
     A bad old woman making a worse will,
       Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
     As certain;--these are paltry things, and yet
     I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.
     I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
       Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind!
     With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
       And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
     Which it can either pain or evil call,
       And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
     Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,
     Is more than I know--the deuce take them both!
       As after reading Athanasius' curse,
     Which doth your true believer so much please:
       I doubt if any now could make it worse
     O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,
       'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
     And decorates the book of Common Prayer,
     As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.
     Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or
       At least one of them!--Oh, the heavy night,
     When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,
       Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
     Of the gray morning, and look vainly for
       Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite--
     To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
     Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!
     These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
       Also beneath the canopy of beds
     Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given
       For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
     Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven
       Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.
     Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
     Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.
     Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
       With all the damsels in their long array,
     Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
       And at the usual signal ta'en their way
     Back to their chambers, those long galleries
       In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
     Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
     Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.
     I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
       The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
     One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
       My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,
     And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
       It being (not now, but only while a lad)
     That womankind had but one rosy mouth,
     To kiss them all at once from North to South.
     O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands
       And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
     In such proportion!--But my Muse withstands
       The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
     Or travelling in Patagonian lands;
       So let us back to Lilliput, and guide
     Our hero through the labyrinth of love
     In which we left him several lines above.
     He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,
       At the given signal join'd to their array;
     And though he certainly ran many risks,
       Yet he could not at times keep, by the way
     (Although the consequences of such frisks
       Are worse than the worst damages men pay
     In moral England, where the thing 's a tax),
     From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.
     Still he forgot not his disguise:--along
       The galleries from room to room they walk'd,
     A virgin-like and edifying throng,
       By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd
     A dame who kept up discipline among
       The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
     Without her sanction on their she-parades:
     Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'
     Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,
       Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;
     But this is her seraglio title, got
       I know not how, but good as any other;
     So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
       Her office was to keep aloof or smother
     All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
     Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.
     A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
       More easy by the absence of all men--
     Except his majesty, who, with her aid,
       And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
     A slight example, just to cast a shade
       Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
     Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,
     Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.
     And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how
       Could you ask such a question?--but we will
     Continue. As I said, this goodly row
       Of ladies of all countries at the will
     Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
       Like water-lilies floating down a rill--
     Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly--
     Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.
     But when they reach'd their own apartments, there,
       Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,
     Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere
       When freed from bonds (which are of no great use
     After all), or like Irish at a fair,
       Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
     Establish'd between them and bondage, they
     Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.
     Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
       Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
     Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
       Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;
     Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,
       Others contended they were but in spring;
     Some thought her rather masculine in height,
     While others wish'd that she had been so quite.
     But no one doubted on the whole, that she
       Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,
     And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'
       Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
     They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
       So silly as to buy slaves who might share
     (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)
     Her throne and power, and every thing beside.
     But what was strangest in this virgin crew,
       Although her beauty was enough to vex,
     After the first investigating view,
       They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
     In the fair form of their companion new,
       Than is the custom of the gentle sex,
     When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,
     In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'
     And yet they had their little jealousies,
       Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
     Whether there are such things as sympathies
       Without our knowledge or our approbation,
     Although they could not see through his disguise,
       All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
     Like magnetism, or devilism, or what
     You please--we will not quarrel about that:
     But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
       Companion something newer still, as 'twere
     A sentimental friendship through and through,
       Extremely pure, which made them all concur
     In wishing her their sister, save a few
       Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
     Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,
     They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.
     Of those who had most genius for this sort
       Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
     Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short
       (To save description), fair as fair can be
     Were they, according to the best report,
       Though differing in stature and degree,
     And clime and time, and country and complexion;
     They all alike admired their new connection.
     Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
       Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
     With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
       And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
     But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
       Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
     Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
     Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.
     A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
       Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those
     Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,
       Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
     Few angles were there in her form, 'tis true,
       Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
     Yet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where
     It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.
     She was not violently lively, but
       Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
     Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
       They put beholders in a tender taking;
     She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
       From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,
     The mortal and the marble still at strife,
     And timidly expanding into life.
     Lolah demanded the new damsel's name--
       'Juanna.'--Well, a pretty name enough.
     Katinka ask'd her also whence she came--
       'From Spain.'--'But where is Spain?'--'Don't ask such stuff,
     Nor show your Georgian ignorance--for shame!'
       Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,
     To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near
     Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'
     Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
       Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
     And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
       As if she pitied her for being there,
     A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
       And all abash'd, too, at the general stare
     Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,
     With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.
     But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
       With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
     I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'
       She added to Juanna, their new guest:
     'Your coming has been unexpected here,
       And every couch is occupied; you had best
     Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early
     We will have all things settled for you fairly.'
     Here Lolah interposed--'Mamma, you know
       You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear
     That anybody should disturb you so;
       I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair
     Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;
       And I of your young charge will take due care.'
     But here Katinka interfered, and said,
     'She also had compassion and a bed.
     'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.
       The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'--'For fear of ghosts,'
     Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see
       A phantom upon each of the four posts;
     And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
       Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'
     The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,
     I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.
     'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
       Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
     The same, Katinka, until by and by;
       And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,
     Who 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,
       And will not toss and chatter the night through.
     What say you, child?'--Dudu said nothing, as
     Her talents were of the more silent class;
     But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow
       Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
     Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
       (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
     She took Juanna by the hand to show
       Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
     The others pouting at the matron's preference
     Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.
     It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
       The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
     Were couches, toilets--and much more than this
       I might describe, as I have seen it all,
     But it suffices--little was amiss;
       'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,
     With all things ladies want, save one or two,
     And even those were nearer than they knew.
     Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
       Not very dashing, but extremely winning,
     With the most regulated charms of feature,
       Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning
     Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature
       Which they hit off at once in the beginning,
     Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
     And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.
     But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,
       Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,
     Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,
       Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it
     Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
       Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:
     I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
     And pity lovers rather more than seamen.
     But she was pensive more than melancholy,
       And serious more than pensive, and serene,
     It may be, more than either--not unholy
       Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
     The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
       Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,
     That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
     She never thought about herself at all.
     And therefore was she kind and gentle as
       The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,
     By which its nomenclature came to pass;
       Thus most appropriately has been shown
     'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,
       But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown
     Extremely common in this age, whose metal
     The devil may decompose, but never settle:
     I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'
       Which was a mixture of all metals, but
     The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass
       This long parenthesis: I could not shut
     It sooner for the soul of me, and class
       My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put
     A kind construction upon them and me:
     But that you won't--then don't--I am not less free.
     'Tis time we should return to plain narration,
       And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudu,
     With every kindness short of ostentation,
       Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
     This labyrinth of females, and each station
       Described--what 's strange--in words extremely few:
     I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,
     For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.
     And next she gave her (I say her, because
       The gender still was epicene, at least
     In outward show, which is a saving clause)
       An outline of the customs of the East,
     With all their chaste integrity of laws,
       By which the more a haram is increased,
     The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
     Of any supernumerary beauties.
     And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
       Dudu was fond of kissing--which I 'm sure
     That nobody can ever take amiss,
       Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,
     And between females means no more than this--
       That they have nothing better near, or newer.
     'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse--
     I wish it never led to something worse.
     In perfect innocence she then unmade
       Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
     A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:
       If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
     'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,
       Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,
     When first she starts, and then returns to peep,
     Admiring this new native of the deep.
     And one by one her articles of dress
       Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd
     Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
       Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:
     Which pass'd well off--as she could do no less;
       Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,
     Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,
     Which surely were invented for our sins,--
     Making a woman like a porcupine,
       Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,
     O ye! whose fate it is, as once 'twas mine,
       In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--
     I did my very boyish best to shine
       In tricking her out for a masquerade;
     The pins were placed sufficiently, but not
     Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.
     But these are foolish things to all the wise,
       And I love wisdom more than she loves me;
     My tendency is to philosophise
       On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
     But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
       What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
     Our ultimate existence? what 's our present?
     Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.
     There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
       And distant from each other burn'd the lights,
     And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
       Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
     They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
       By way of change from their sepulchral sites,
     And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
     Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.
     Many and beautiful lay those around,
       Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
     In some exotic garden sometimes found,
       With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
     One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
       And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
     Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,
     And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.
     One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,
       And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
     Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
       And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
     The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,
       As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
     Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
     All bashfully to struggle into light.
     This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
       'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
     A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more
       The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
     Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
       Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
     (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges
     The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.
     A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
       Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;
     White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,
       Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,
     Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--
       My similes are gather'd in a heap,
     So pick and choose--perhaps you 'll be content
     With a carved lady on a monument.
     And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?
       A lady of a 'certain age,' which means
     Certainly aged--what her years might be
       I know not, never counting past their teens;
     But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
       As ere that awful period intervenes
     Which lays both men and women on the shelf,
     To meditate upon their sins and self.
     But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?
       With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
     And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
       But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
     Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
       And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
     To those who like their company, about
     The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:
     And that so loudly, that upstarted all
       The Oda, in a general commotion:
     Matron and maids, and those whom you may call
       Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,
     One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
       All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
     More than I have myself of what could make
     The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.
     But wide awake she was, and round her bed,
       With floating draperies and with flying hair,
     With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
       And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,
     And bright as any meteor ever bred
       By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,
     For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,
     Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.
     But what was strange--and a strong proof how great
       A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay
     As fast as ever husband by his mate
       In holy matrimony snores away.
     Not all the clamour broke her happy state
       Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say
     At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
     And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.
     And now commenced a strict investigation,
       Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,
     Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,
       Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
     To answer in a very clear oration.
       Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
     But, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'
     Could not at first expound what was amiss.
     At length she said, that in a slumber sound
       She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood--
     A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found
       Himself in at the age when all grow good;
     Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd
       Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;
     And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
     And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;
     And in the midst a golden apple grew,--
       A most prodigious pippin,--but it hung
     Rather too high and distant; that she threw
       Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
     Stones and whatever she could pick up, to
       Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
     To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
     But always at a most provoking height;--
     That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
       It fell down of its own accord before
     Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
       And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
     That just as her young lip began to ope
       Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,
     A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,
     And so--she awoke with a great scream and start.
     All this she told with some confusion and
       Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
     Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
       To expound their vain and visionary gleams.
     I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
       Prophetically, or that which one deems
     A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase
     By which such things are settled now-a-days.
     The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
       Began, as is the consequence of fear,
     To scold a little at the false alarm
       That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
     The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
       Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
     And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,
     And said that she was sorry she had cried.
     'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;
       But visions of an apple and a bee,
     To take us from our natural rest, and pull
       The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
     Would make us think the moon is at its full.
       You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
     To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
     Will say to this hysteric of a vision.
     'And poor Juanna, too--the child's first night
       Within these walls to be broke in upon
     With such a clamour! I had thought it right
       That the young stranger should not lie alone,
     And, as the quietest of all, she might
       With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;
     But now I must transfer her to the charge
     Of Lolah--though her couch is not so large.'
     Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
       But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,
     Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
       Implored that present pardon might be shown
     For this first fault, and that on no condition
       (She added in a soft and piteous tone)
     Juanna should be taken from her, and
     Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.
     She promised never more to have a dream,
       At least to dream so loudly as just now;
     She wonder'd at herself how she could scream--
       'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
     A fond hallucination, and a theme
       For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,
     And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over
     This weakness in a few hours, and recover.
     And here Juanna kindly interposed,
       And said she felt herself extremely well
     Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed
       When all around rang like a tocsin bell:
     She did not find herself the least disposed
       To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell
     Apart from one who had no sin to show,
     Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'
     As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round
       And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
     Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
       The colour of a budding rose's crest.
     I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound
       The mystery of this rupture of their rest;
     All that I know is, that the facts I state
     Are true as truth has ever been of late.
     And so good night to them,--or, if you will,
       Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light
     Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
       And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
     Of the long caravan, which in the chill
       Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
     That stretches to the stony belt, which girds
     Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.
     With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,
       Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
     As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
       Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
     The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
       Which fable places in her breast of wail,
     Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
     Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.
     And that 's the moral of this composition,
       If people would but see its real drift;--
     But that they will not do without suspicion,
       Because all gentle readers have the gift
     Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;
       While gentle writers also love to lift
     Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
     The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.
     Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,
       Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried
     Aloud because his feelings were too tender
       To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,--
     So beautiful that art could little mend her,
       Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;--
     So agitated was she with her error,
     She did not even look into the mirror.
     Also arose about the self-same time,
       Perhaps a little later, her great lord,
     Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,
       And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
     A thing of much less import in that clime--
       At least to those of incomes which afford
     The filling up their whole connubial cargo--
     Than where two wives are under an embargo.
     He did not think much on the matter, nor
       Indeed on any other: as a man
     He liked to have a handsome paramour
       At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
     And therefore of Circassians had good store,
       As an amusement after the Divan;
     Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
     Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.
     And now he rose; and after due ablutions
       Exacted by the customs of the East,
     And prayers and other pious evolutions,
       He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
     And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
       Whose victories had recently increased
     In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,
     But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!
       Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
     Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander
       Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
     A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
       Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
     Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be
     Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.
     To call men love-begotten or proclaim
       Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
     That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
       A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
     But people's ancestors are history's game;
       And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
     All generations, I should like to know
     What pedigree the best would have to show?
     Had Catherine and the sultan understood
       Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
     Until 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,
       There was a way to end their strife, although
     Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
       Without the aid of prince or plenipo:
     She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
     And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.
     But as it was, his Highness had to hold
       His daily council upon ways and means
     How to encounter with this martial scold,
       This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
     And the perplexity could not be told
       Of all the pillars of the state, which leans
     Sometimes a little heavy on the backs
     Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.
     Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,
       Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place
     For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
       And rich with all contrivances which grace
     Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone
       Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
     Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,
     Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.
     Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,
       Vied with each other on this costly spot;
     And singing birds without were heard to warble;
       And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
     Varied each ray;--but all descriptions garble
       The true effect, and so we had better not
     Be too minute; an outline is the best,--
     A lively reader's fancy does the rest.
     And here she summon'd Baba, and required
       Don Juan at his hands, and information
     Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
       And whether he had occupied their station;
     If matters had been managed as desired,
       And his disguise with due consideration
     Kept up; and above all, the where and how
     He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.
     Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
       To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
     More easily than answer'd,--that he had tried
       His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
     But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
       Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;
     He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
     To which embarrass'd people have recourse.
     Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,
       Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
     She liked quick answers in all conversations;
       And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
     In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;
       And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,
     Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
     And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
     When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
       To bode him no great good, he deprecated
     Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through--
       He could not help the thing which he related:
     Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
       Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
     But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
     The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.
     The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom
       The discipline of the whole haram bore,
     As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,
       For Baba's function stopt short at the door,
     Had settled all; nor could he then presume
       (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,
     Without exciting such suspicion as
     Might make the matter still worse than it was.
     He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
       Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact
     'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,
       Because a foolish or imprudent act
     Would not alone have made him insecure,
       But ended in his being found out and sack'd,
     And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke
     Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.
     This he discreetly kept in the background,
       And talk'd away--and might have talk'd till now,
     For any further answer that he found,
       So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
     Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
       As if she had received a sudden blow,
     And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
     O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.
     Although she was not of the fainting sort,
       Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd--
     It was but a convulsion, which though short
       Can never be described; we all have heard,
     And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
       When things beyond the common have occurr'd;--
     Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony
     What she could ne'er express--then how should I?
     She stood a moment as a Pythones
       Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full
     Of inspiration gather'd from distress,
       When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
     The heart asunder;--then, as more or lees
       Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
     She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
     And bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.
     Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
       Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,
     Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
       Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,
     A low soft ottoman), and black despair
       Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,
     Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check
     Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.
     Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
       Conceal'd her features better than a veil;
     And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
       White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:
     Would that I were a painter! to be grouping
       All that a poet drags into detail
     O that my words were colours! but their tints
     May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.
     Baba, who knew by experience when to talk
       And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
     This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
       Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.
     At length she rose up, and began to walk
       Slowly along the room, but silent still,
     And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;
     The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.
     She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak--but paused,
       And then moved on again with rapid pace;
     Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
       By deep emotion:--you may sometimes trace
     A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
       By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
     By all the demons of all passions, show'd
     Their work even by the way in which he trode.
     Gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:--'Slave!
       Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,
     But one which Baba did not like to brave,
       And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
     To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave
       (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown
     What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,
     For fear of any error, like the late.
     'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
       The imperial bride--and added, 'Let the boat
     Be ready by the secret portal's side:
       You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,
     Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
       And of this Baba willingly took note,
     And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,
     She would revoke the order he had heard.
     'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
       Sultana, think upon the consequence:
     It is not that I shall not all fulfil
       Your orders, even in their severest sense;
     But such precipitation may end ill,
       Even at your own imperative expense:
     I do not mean destruction and exposure,
     In case of any premature disclosure;
     'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest
       Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide
     Already many a once love-beaten breast
       Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--
     You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,
       And if this violent remedy be tried--
     Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,
     That killing him is not the way to cure you.'
     'What dost thou know of love or feeling?--Wretch!
       Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes--'and do
     My bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch
       His own remonstrance further he well knew
     Might end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'
       And though he wish'd extremely to get through
     This awkward business without harm to others,
     He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.
     Away he went then upon his commission,
       Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase
     Against all women of whate'er condition,
       Especially sultanas and their ways;
     Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
       Their never knowing their own mind two days,
     The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
     Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.
     And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
       And sent one on a summons to the pair,
     That they must instantly be well array'd,
       And above all be comb'd even to a hair,
     And brought before the empress, who had made
       Inquiries after them with kindest care:
     At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;
     But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.
     And here I leave them at their preparation
       For the imperial presence, wherein whether
     Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,
       Or got rid of the parties altogether,
     Like other angry ladies of her nation,--
       Are things the turning of a hair or feather
     May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
     In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.
     I leave them for the present with good wishes,
       Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
     Another part of history; for the dishes
       Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
     And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
       Although his situation now seems strange
     And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
     The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.
[Illustration: Canto 7]
   O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly
       Around us ever, rarely to alight?
     There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
       Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.
     Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high
       Our eyes in search of either lovely light;
     A thousand and a thousand colours they
     Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.
     And such as they are, such my present tale is,
       A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,
     A versified Aurora Borealis,
       Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.
     When we know what all are, we must bewail us,
       But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
     To laugh at all things--for I wish to know
     What, after all, are all things--but a show?
     They accuse me--Me--the present writer of
       The present poem--of--I know not what--
     A tendency to under-rate and scoff
       At human power and virtue, and all that;
     And this they say in language rather rough.
       Good God! I wonder what they would be at!
     I say no more than hath been said in Dante's
     Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;
     By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,
       By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;
     By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,
       Who knew this life was not worth a potato.
     'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so--
       For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,
     Nor even Diogenes.--We live and die,
     But which is best, you know no more than I.
     Socrates said, our only knowledge was
       'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant
     Science enough, which levels to an ass
       Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.
     Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!
       Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,
     That he himself felt only 'like a youth
     Picking up shells by the great ocean--Truth.'
     Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-
       Most modern preachers say the same, or show it
     By their examples of true Christianity:
       In short, all know, or very soon may know it;
     And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,
       By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,
     Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,
     From holding up the nothingness of life?
     Dogs, or men!--for I flatter you in saying
       That ye are dogs--your betters far--ye may
     Read, or read not, what I am now essaying
       To show ye what ye are in every way.
     As little as the moon stops for the baying
       Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
     From out her skies--then howl your idle wrath!
     While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.
     'Fierce loves and faithless wars'--I am not sure
       If this be the right reading--'t is no matter;
     The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
       I sing them both, and am about to batter
     A town which did a famous siege endure,
       And was beleaguer'd both by land and water
     By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,
     Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.
     The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed
       Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,
     With buildings in the Oriental taste,
       But still a fortress of the foremost rank,
     Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,
       Which with your conquerors is a common prank:
     It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,
     And measures round of toises thousands three.
     Within the extent of this fortification
       A borough is comprised along the height
     Upon the left, which from its loftier station
       Commands the city, and upon its site
     A Greek had raised around this elevation
       A quantity of palisades upright,
     So placed as to impede the fire of those
     Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.
     This circumstance may serve to give a notion
       Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
     But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
       The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:
     But then there was a great want of precaution
       (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),
     Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,
     To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'
     But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
       And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
     Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,
       Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'
     Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
       While two and twenty cannon duly set
     Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,
     Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.
     But from the river the town 's open quite,
       Because the Turks could never be persuaded
     A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
       And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
     When it grew rather late to set things right.
       But as the Danube could not well be waded,
     They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
     And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'
     The Russians now were ready to attack:
       But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
     How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
       Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
     Alas! what to their memory can lack?
       Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
     Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,
     Whose names want nothing but--pronunciation.
     Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
       Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,
     Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,
       And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,
     And others of twelve consonants apiece;
       And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
     Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),
     It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,
     And cannot tune those discords of narration,
       Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;
     Yet there were several worth commemoration,
       As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
     Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
       Of Londonderry drawling against time,
     Ending in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:
     Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,
     Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,
       Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,
     All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high
       Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
     Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,
       Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin
     Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,
     And no more handy substitute been near.
     Then there were foreigners of much renown,
       Of various nations, and all volunteers;
     Not fighting for their country or its crown,
       But wishing to be one day brigadiers;
     Also to have the sacking of a town,--
       A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
     'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,
     Sixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.
     Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest
       Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;
     I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
       But such a godfather 's as good a card.
     Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
       Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,
     Was he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters
     At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.
     The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;
       But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith
     Was born in Cumberland among the hills,
       And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
     I 've said all I know of a name that fills
       Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'
     A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
     He fell, immortal in a bulletin.
     I wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god
       Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin
     May make up for a bullet in his body?
       I hope this little question is no sin,
     Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
       I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
     The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
     Which many people pass for wits by quoting.
     Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
       But I 'm too great a patriot to record
     Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
       I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
     Of truth;--such truths are treason; they betray
       Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
     Who name the French in English, save to show
     How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.
     The Russians, having built two batteries on
       An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
     The first was to bombard it, and knock down
       The public buildings and the private too,
     No matter what poor souls might be undone.
       The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;
     Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling
     Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.
     The second object was to profit by
       The moment of the general consternation,
     To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
       Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:
     But a third motive was as probably
       To frighten them into capitulation;
     A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,
     Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.
     A habit rather blamable, which is
       That of despising those we combat with,
     Common in many cases, was in this
       The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;
     One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss
       Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'
     But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'
     That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'
     The Russian batteries were incomplete,
       Because they were constructed in a hurry;
     Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,
       And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
     When the sale of new books is not so fleet
       As they who print them think is necessary,
     May likewise put off for a time what story
     Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'
     Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
       Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
     Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
       Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
     Of homicide, but there was no solidity
       In the new batteries erected there;
     They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
     And added greatly to the missing list.
     A sad miscalculation about distance
       Made all their naval matters incorrect;
     Three fireships lost their amiable existence
       Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:
     The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
       Could remedy this lubberly defect;
     They blew up in the middle of the river,
     While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.
     At seven they rose, however, and survey'd
       The Russ flotilla getting under way;
     'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,
       Within a cable's length their vessels lay
     Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
       Which was return'd with interest, I may say,
     And by a fire of musketry and grape,
     And shells and shot of every size and shape.
     For six hours bore they without intermission
       The Turkish fire, and aided by their own
     Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:
       At length they found mere cannonade alone
     By no means would produce the town's submission,
       And made a signal to retreat at one.
     One bark blew up, a second near the works
     Running aground, was taken by the Turks.
     The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;
       But when they saw the enemy retire,
     Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
       And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
     And tried to make a landing on the main;
       But here the effect fell short of their desire:
     Count Damas drove them back into the water
     Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.
     'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report
       All that the Russians did upon this day,
     I think that several volumes would fall short,
       And I should still have many things to say;'
     And so he says no more--but pays his court
       To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;
     The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
     Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.
     This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
       For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how
     Many of common readers give a guess
       That such existed? (and they may live now
     For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;
       There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
     'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne
     Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.
     But here are men who fought in gallant actions
       As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
     But buried in the heap of such transactions
       Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
     Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,
       And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
     Of all our modern battles, I will bet
     You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.
     In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,
       Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,
     And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)
       Most strongly recommended an assault;
     In which he was opposed by young and hoary,
       Which made a long debate; but I must halt,
     For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,
     I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.
     There was a man, if that he was a man,
       Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,
     For had he not been Hercules, his span
       Had been as short in youth as indigestion
     Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,
       He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
     The soil of the green province he had wasted,
     As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.
     This was Potemkin--a great thing in days
       When homicide and harlotry made great;
     If stars and titles could entail long praise,
       His glory might half equal his estate.
     This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
       A kind of phantasy proportionate
     In the then sovereign of the Russian people,
     Who measured men as you would do a steeple.
     While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent
       A courier to the prince, and he succeeded
     In ordering matters after his own bent;
       I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
     But shortly he had cause to be content.
       In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,
     And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
     Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.
     But on the thirteenth, when already part
       Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,
     A courier on the spur inspired new heart
       Into all panters for newspaper praise,
     As well as dilettanti in war's art,
       By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;
     Announcing the appointment of that lover of
     Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.
     The letter of the prince to the same marshal
       Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause
     Been one to which a good heart could be partial--
       Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
     But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
       With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
     Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
     'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'
     'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'
       'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal
     The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night
       (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
     More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
       Summers could renovate, though they should be
     Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
     For war cuts up not only branch, but root.
     Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now
       Began to signalise the Russ retreat,
     Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
       In thinking that their enemy is beat
     (Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though
       I never think about it in a heat),
     But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
     Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.
     For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew
       In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques
     For some time, till they came in nearer view.
       They had but little baggage at their backs,
     For there were but three shirts between the two;
       But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
     Till, in approaching, were at length descried
     In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.
     'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,
       When London had a grand illumination,
     Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,
       Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
     So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,
       That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
     His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
     To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.
     'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
       For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath
     Is to the devil now no farther prize,
       Since John has lately lost the use of both.
     Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
       And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
     Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,
     Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.
     But to the tale:--great joy unto the camp!
       To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,
     O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
       Presaging a most luminous attack;
     Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
       Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,
     He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
     Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.
     But certes matters took a different face;
       There was enthusiasm and much applause,
     The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
       And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
     Within a cannon-shot length of the place
       They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws
     In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
     And all kinds of benevolent machines.
     'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
       Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
     As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
       Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;
     Or as a little dog will lead the blind,
       Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection
     By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;
     Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.
     The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
       That they were going to a marriage feast
     (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
       Since there is discord after both at least):
     There was not now a luggage boy but sought
       Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
     And why? because a little--odd--old man,
     Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.
     But so it was; and every preparation
       Was made with all alacrity: the first
     Detachment of three columns took its station,
       And waited but the signal's voice to burst
     Upon the foe: the second's ordination
       Was also in three columns, with a thirst
     For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:
     The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.
     New batteries were erected, and was held
       A general council, in which unanimity,
     That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,
       As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
     And every difficulty being dispell'd,
       Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,
     While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,
     Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet
     It is an actual fact, that he, commander
       In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill
     The awkward squad, and could afford to squander
       His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
     Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander
       To swallow flame, and never take it ill:
     He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which
     Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.
     Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines
       Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,
     And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
       By way of lesson against actual Turks:
     And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
       He judged them proper to assail the works;
     At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:
     He made no answer; but he took the city.
     Most things were in this posture on the eve
       Of the assault, and all the camp was in
     A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;
       Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
     Are very silent when they once believe
       That all is settled:--there was little din,
     For some were thinking of their home and friends,
     And others of themselves and latter ends.
     Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
       Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;
     For the man was, we safely may assert,
       A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;
     Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
       Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;
     Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm
     A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.
     The day before the assault, while upon drill--
       For this great conqueror play'd the corporal--
     Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
       Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
     One of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,
       'T was much that he was understood at all;
     But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
     They found that he had fought beneath their banner.
     Whereon immediately at his request
       They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
     Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
       That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
     And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
       Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters
     Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
     It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.
     Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
       Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,
     Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,
       And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--
     For deeming human clay but common dirt,
       This great philosopher was thus instilling
     His maxims, which to martial comprehension
     Proved death in battle equal to a pension;--
     Suwarrow, when he saw this company
       Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast
     Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:--
       'Whence come ye?'--'From Constantinople last,
     Captives just now escaped,' was the reply.
       'What are ye?'--'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd
     This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
     To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.
     'Your names?'--'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;
       The other two are women, and the third
     Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on
       The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard
     Your name before, the second is a new one:
       To bring the other three here was absurd:
     But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name
     In the Nikolaiew regiment?'--'The same.'
     'You served at Widdin?'--'Yes.'--'You led the attack?'
       'I did.'--'What next?'--'I really hardly know.'
     'You were the first i' the breach?'--'I was not slack
       At least to follow those who might be so.'
     'What follow'd?'--'A shot laid me on my back,
       And I became a prisoner to the foe.'
     'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
     Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.
     'Where will you serve?'--'Where'er you please.'--'I know
       You like to be the hope of the forlorn,
     And doubtless would be foremost on the foe
       After the hardships you 've already borne.
     And this young fellow--say what can he do?
       He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'
     'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault
     In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'
     'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd
       Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow
     Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,
       By special providence, to lead to-morrow,
     Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd
       To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow
     Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk
     Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.
     'So now, my lads, for glory!'--Here he turn'd
       And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,
     Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd
       For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion
     A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
       All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
     To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering
     The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.
     Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
       Himself a favourite, ventured to address
     Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
       In his resumed amusement. 'I confess
     My debt in being thus allow'd to die
       Among the foremost; but if you 'd express
     Explicitly our several posts, my friend
     And self would know what duty to attend.'
     'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you
       Will join your former regiment, which should be
     Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to
       (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)
     His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
       The stranger stripling may remain with me;
     He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent
     To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'
     But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
       The ladies,--who by no means had been bred
     To be disposed of in a way so new,
       Although their haram education led
     Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,
       Passive obedience,--now raised up the head,
     With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
     Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,
     O'er the promoted couple of brave men
       Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief
     That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
       Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.
     O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
       O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf
     Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
     Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.
     Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
       And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
     The women with their hair about their ears
       And natural agonies, with a slight shade
     Of feeling: for however habit sears
       Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade
     Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow
     Will touch even heroes--and such was Suwarrow.
     He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--
       'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
     By bringing women here? They shall be shown
       All the attention possible, and seen
     In safety to the waggons, where alone
       In fact they can be safe. You should have been
     Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:
     Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'
     'May it please your excellency,' thus replied
       Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,
     And not our own. I am too qualified
       By service with my military brothers
     To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
       Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers
     The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
     As leaving a small family at large.
     'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
       With their attendant aided our escape,
     And afterwards accompanied us through
       A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
     To me this kind of life is not so new;
       To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.
     I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
     Request that they may both be used genteelly.'
     Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,
       Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
     Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
       Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
     To see an old man, rather wild than wise
       In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,
     Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
     More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.
     For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,
       As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
     Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,
       To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,
     Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
       (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),
     With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt
     How power could condescend to do without.
     John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
       Though little versed in feelings oriental,
     Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
       Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
     Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
       Or that the Russian army should repent all:
     And, strange to say, they found some consolation
     In this--for females like exaggeration.
     And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
       They parted for the present--these to await,
     According to the artillery's hits or misses,
       What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate
     (Uncertainty is one of many blisses,
       A mortgage on Humanity's estate)--
     While their beloved friends began to arm,
     To burn a town which never did them harm.
     Suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross,
       Being much too gross to see them in detail,
     Who calculated life as so much dross,
       And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,
     And cared as little for his army's loss
       (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
     As wife and friends did for the boils of job,--
     What was 't to him to hear two women sob?
     Nothing.--The work of glory still went on
       In preparations for a cannonade
     As terrible as that of Ilion,
       If Homer had found mortars ready made;
     But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
       We only can but talk of escalade,
     Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,--
     Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.
     O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm
       All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,
     By merely wielding with poetic arm
       Arms to which men will never more resort,
     Unless gunpowder should be found to harm
       Much less than is the hope of every court,
     Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;
     But they will not find Liberty a Troy:--
     O, thou eternal Homer! I have now
       To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
     With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
       Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
     And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
       To vie with thee would be about as vain
     As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;
     But still we moderns equal you in blood;
     If not in poetry, at least in fact;
       And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!
     Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
       There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
     But now the town is going to be attack'd;
       Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?
     Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches
     To colour up his rays from your despatches.
     O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!
       O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!
     Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,
       When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
     O, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye
       Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)
     A portion of your fading twilight hues,
     So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.
     When I call 'fading' martial immortality,
       I mean, that every age and every year,
     And almost every day, in sad reality,
       Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
     Who, when we come to sum up the totality
       Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
     Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
     Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.
     Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,
       Are things immortal to immortal man,
     As purple to the Babylonian harlot:
       An uniform to boys is like a fan
     To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet
       But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
     But Glory's glory; and if you would find
     What that is--ask the pig who sees the wind!
     At least he feels it, and some say he sees,
       Because he runs before it like a pig;
     Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
       Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,
     A schooner, or--but it is time to ease
       This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
     The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
     Like a bob-major from a village steeple.
     Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
       The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
     Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
       Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank
     Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
       The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
     Which curl in curious wreaths:--how soon the smoke
     Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!
     Here pause we for the present--as even then
       That awful pause, dividing life from death,
     Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
       Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!
     A moment--and all will be life again!
       The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!
     Hurra! and Allah! and--one moment more,
     The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.
[Illustration: Canto 8]
   O blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!
       These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
     Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:
       And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
     Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds
       At present such things, since they are her theme,
     So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
     Bellona, what you will--they mean but wars.
     All was prepared--the fire, the sword, the men
       To wield them in their terrible array.
     The army, like a lion from his den,
       March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,--
     A human Hydra, issuing from its fen
       To breathe destruction on its winding way,
     Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain
     Immediately in others grew again.
     History can only take things in the gross;
       But could we know them in detail, perchance
     In balancing the profit and the loss,
       War's merit it by no means might enhance,
     To waste so much gold for a little dross,
       As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
     The drying up a single tear has more
     Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.
     And why?--because it brings self-approbation;
       Whereas the other, after all its glare,
     Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
       Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,
     A higher title, or a loftier station,
       Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,
     Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,
     Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.
     And such they are--and such they will be found:
       Not so Leonidas and Washington,
     Whose every battle-field is holy ground,
       Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
     How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
       While the mere victor's may appal or stun
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     A watchword till the future shall be free.
     The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd
       Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,
     Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,
       And in the Danube's waters shone the same--
     A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud
       Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame
     The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
     Spare, or smite rarely--man's make millions ashes!
     The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
       Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
     When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
       Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
     Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
       Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;
     While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when
     The restless Titan hiccups in his den.
     And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
       In the same moment, loud as even the roar
     Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
       Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
     Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close
       With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,
     Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through
     All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'
     The columns were in movement one and all,
       But of the portion which attack'd by water,
     Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
       Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
     As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
       'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'
     If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
     Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.
     The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
       Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between
     His cap and head, which proves the head to be
       Aristocratic as was ever seen,
     Because it then received no injury
       More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
     No harm unto a right legitimate head:
     'Ashes to ashes'--why not lead to lead?
     Also the General Markow, Brigadier,
       Insisting on removal of the prince
     Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,--
       All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
     And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--
       The General Markow, who could thus evince
     His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
     To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.
     Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
       And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
     Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
       Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;
     Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,
       Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills
     Past, present, and to come;--but all may yield
     To the true portrait of one battle-field.
     There the still varying pangs, which multiply
       Until their very number makes men hard
     By the infinities of agony,
       Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard--
     The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye
       Turn'd back within its socket,--these reward
     Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
     May win perhaps a riband at the breast!
     Yet I love glory;--glory 's a great thing:--
       Think what it is to be in your old age
     Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:
       A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,
     And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
       Which is still better; thus in verse to wage
     Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
     Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.
     The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
       To take a battery on the right; the others,
     Who landed lower down, their landing done,
       Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:
     Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
       Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,
     O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,
     Quite orderly, as if upon parade.
     And this was admirable; for so hot
       The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,
     Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
     Of officers a third fell on the spot,
       A thing which victory by no means boded
     To gentlemen engaged in the assault:
     Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.
     But here I leave the general concern,
       To track our hero on his path of fame:
     He must his laurels separately earn;
       For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,
     Though all deserving equally to turn
       A couplet, or an elegy to claim,
     Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,
     And what is worse still, a much longer story:
     And therefore we must give the greater number
       To the Gazette--which doubtless fairly dealt
     By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
       In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
     Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--
       Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
     In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss
     Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.
     Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,
       And fought away with might and main, not knowing
     The way which they had never trod before,
       And still less guessing where they might be going;
     But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,
       Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,
     But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
     To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.
     Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire
       Of dead and dying thousands,--sometimes gaining
     A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher
       To some odd angle for which all were straining;
     At other times, repulsed by the close fire,
       Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining
     Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er
     A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.
     Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though
       The nightly muster and the silent march
     In the chill dark, when courage does not glow
       So much as under a triumphal arch,
     Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw
       A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,
     Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;--
     Yet for all this he did not run away.
     Indeed he could not. But what if he had?
       There have been and are heroes who begun
     With something not much better, or as bad:
       Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,
     For the first and last time; for, like a pad,
       Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one
     Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,
     And fight like fiends for pay or politics.
     He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
       Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic
     (The antiquarians who can settle time,
       Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,
     Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
       With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
     Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational
     As any other notion, and not national);--
     But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'
       A thing of impulse and a child of song;
     Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,
       Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),
     And afterward, if he must needs destroy,
       In such good company as always throng
     To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
     No less delighted to employ his leisure;
     But always without malice: if he warr'd
       Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best
     Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,
       To be produced when brought up to the test.
     The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer--ward
       Off each attack, when people are in quest
     Of their designs, by saying they meant well;
     'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'
     I almost lately have begun to doubt
       Whether hell's pavement--if it be so paved--
     Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
       Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,
     But by the mass who go below without
       Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
     And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
     Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.
     Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides
       Warrior from warrior in their grim career,
     Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides
       Just at the close of the first bridal year,
     By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,
       Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,
     When, after a good deal of heavy firing,
     He found himself alone, and friends retiring.
     I don't know how the thing occurr'd--it might
       Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,
     And that the rest had faced unto the right
       About; a circumstance which has confounded
     Caesar himself, who, in the very sight
       Of his whole army, which so much abounded
     In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
     And rally back his Romans to the field.
     Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was
       No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought
     He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
       Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought
     For a much longer time; then, like an as
       (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought
     This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
     Perhaps may find it better than a new one)--
     Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
       And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;
     But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
       Over the hills, a fire enough to blind
     Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
       He stumbled on, to try if he could find
     A path, to add his own slight arm and forces
     To corps, the greater part of which were corses.
     Perceiving then no more the commandant
       Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
     Quite disappear'd--the gods know howl (I can't
       Account for every thing which may look bad
     In history; but we at least may grant
       It was not marvellous that a mere lad,
     In search of glory, should look on before,
     Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):--
     Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
       And left at large, like a young heir, to make
     His way to--where he knew not--single handed;
       As travellers follow over bog and brake
     An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded
       Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;
     So Juan, following honour and his nose,
     Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.
     He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
       For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins
     Fill'd as with lightning--for his spirit shared
       The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
     And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
       And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
     He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken
     By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!
     And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he
       Fell in with what was late the second column,
     Under the orders of the General Lascy,
       But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
     Into an elegant extract (much less massy)
       Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
     Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces
     And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.
     Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
       Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when
     Men run away much rather than go through
       Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
     But Johnson was a clever fellow, who
       Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'
     And never ran away, except when running
     Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.
     And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
       Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose
     More virgin valour never dreamt of flying
       From ignorance of danger, which indues
     Its votaries, like innocence relying
       On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,--
     Johnson retired a little, just to rally
     Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'
     And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,
       Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,
     Rampart, wall, casement, house,--for there was not
       In this extensive city, sore beset
     By Christian soldiery, a single spot
       Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,
     He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
     By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.
     And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
       Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from
     The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
       Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.
     Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
       At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
     And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds
     Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.
     By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,
       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
     Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
       We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his
     Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon
       Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):
     Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,
     And could be very busy without bustle;
     And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
       Upon reflection, knowing that behind
     He would find others who would fain be rid so
       Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
     Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so
       Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
     But when they light upon immediate death,
     Retire a little, merely to take breath.
     But Johnson only ran off, to return
       With many other warriors, as we said,
     Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,
       Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.
     To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:
       His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
     Acted upon the living as on wire,
     And led them back into the heaviest fire.
     Egad! they found the second time what they
       The first time thought quite terrible enough
     To fly from, malgre all which people say
       Of glory, and all that immortal stuff
     Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,
       That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)--
     They found on their return the self-same welcome,
     Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.
     They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
       Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
     Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail
       As any other boon for which men stickle.
     The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,
       Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
     Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd
     Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.
     The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks
       Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,
     And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
       However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels
     Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,
       So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,
     That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,
     Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.
     First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,
       Came mounting quickly up, for it was now
     All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
       Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,
     So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,
       The gentlemen that were the first to show
     Their martial faces on the parapet,
     Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.
     But those who scaled, found out that their advance
       Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:
     The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
       Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
     To see in forts of Netherlands or France
       (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)--
     Right in the middle of the parapet
     Just named, these palisades were primly set:
     So that on either side some nine or ten
       Paces were left, whereon you could contrive
     To march; a great convenience to our men,
       At least to all those who were left alive,
     Who thus could form a line and fight again;
       And that which farther aided them to strive
     Was, that they could kick down the palisades,
     Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.
     Among the first,--I will not say the first,
       For such precedence upon such occasions
     Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
       Out between friends as well as allied nations:
     The Briton must be bold who really durst
       Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
     As say that Wellington at Waterloo
     Was beaten--though the Prussians say so too;--
     And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
       And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
     Had not come up in time to cast an awe
       Into the hearts of those who fought till now
     As tigers combat with an empty craw,
       The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
     His orders, also to receive his pensions,
     Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.
     But never mind;--'God save the king!' and kings!
       For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer--
     I think I hear a little bird, who sings
       The people by and by will be the stronger:
     The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
       So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
     Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob
     At last fall sick of imitating Job.
     At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
       Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;
     At last it takes to weapons such as men
       Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.
     Then comes 'the tug of war;'--'t will come again,
       I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'
     If I had not perceived that revolution
     Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.
     But to continue:--I say not the first,
       But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
     Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
       Amidst such scenes--though this was quite a new one
     To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
       Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
     Pervaded him--although a generous creature,
     As warm in heart as feminine in feature.
     And here he was--who upon woman's breast,
       Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
     The man in all the rest might be confest,
       To him it was Elysium to be there;
     And he could even withstand that awkward test
       Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
     'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'
     But Juan never left them, while they had charms,
     Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,
       Or near relations, who are much the same.
     But here he was!--where each tie that can bind
       Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
     And he whose very body was all mind,
       Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame
     The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
     Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.
     So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,
       As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
     Or double post and rail, where the existence
       Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,
     The lightest being the safest: at a distance
       He hated cruelty, as all men hate
     Blood, until heated--and even then his own
     At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.
     The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,
       Seeing arrive an aid so opportune
     As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
       Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,
     To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd
       His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
     Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'
     (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.
     Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
       As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
     In answer made an inclination to
       The general who held him in command;
     For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
       Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
     Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,
     He recognised an officer of rank.
     Short speeches pass between two men who speak
       No common language; and besides, in time
     Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
       Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
     Is perpetrated ere a word can break
       Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
     In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
     There cannot be much conversation there.
     And therefore all we have related in
       Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;
     But in the same small minute, every sin
       Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
     The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
       Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,
     As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
     Of human nature's agonising voice!
     The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
       'God made the country and man made the town,'
     So Cowper says--and I begin to be
       Of his opinion, when I see cast down
     Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,
       All walls men know, and many never known;
     And pondering on the present and the past,
     To deem the woods shall be our home at last
     Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,
       Who passes for in life and death most lucky,
     Of the great names which in our faces stare,
       The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,
     Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;
       For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
     Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
     Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.
     Crime came not near him--she is not the child
       Of solitude; Health shrank not from him--for
     Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
       Where if men seek her not, and death be more
     Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
       By habit to what their own hearts abhor--
     In cities caged. The present case in point I
     Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;
     And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
       For which men vainly decimate the throng,
     Not only famous, but of that good fame,
       Without which glory 's but a tavern song--
     Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,
       Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;
     An active hermit, even in age the child
     Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.
     'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
       When they built up unto his darling trees,--
     He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
       Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
     The inconvenience of civilisation
       Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
     But where he met the individual man,
     He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.
     He was not all alone: around him grew
       A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
     Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,
       Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
     On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
       A frown on Nature's or on human face;
     The free-born forest found and kept them free,
     And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.
     And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
       Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
     Because their thoughts had never been the prey
       Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;
     No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,
       No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
     Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,
     Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.
     Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,
       And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;
     Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;
       Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;
     The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
       With the free foresters divide no spoil;
     Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes
     Of this unsighing people of the woods.
     So much for Nature:--by way of variety,
       Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!
     And the sweet consequence of large society,
       War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,
     The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
       The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
     The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,
     With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.
     The town was enter'd: first one column made
       Its sanguinary way good--then another;
     The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
       Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother
     With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:
       Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
     The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot
     The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.
     Koutousow, he who afterward beat back
       (With some assistance from the frost and snow)
     Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
       It happen'd was himself beat back just now;
     He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
       His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
     Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
     But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:
     For having thrown himself into a ditch,
       Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,
     Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,
       He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
     But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch
       ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's
     Was much regretted), for the Moslem men
     Threw them all down into the ditch again.
     And had it not been for some stray troops landing
       They knew not where, being carried by the stream
     To some spot, where they lost their understanding,
       And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
     Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,
       That which a portal to their eyes did seem,--
     The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
     Where three parts of his column yet remain.
     And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
       After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'
     Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
       Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
     Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups
       Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
     Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
     Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.
     The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques
       (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,
     So that I do not grossly err in facts,
       Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)--
     Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
       And no great dilettanti in topography
     Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases
     Their chiefs to order,--were all cut to pieces.
     Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
       Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,
     And naturally thought they could have plunder'd
       The city, without being farther hamper'd;
     But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd--
       The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,
     Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,
     From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.
     Then being taken by the tail--a taking
       Fatal to bishops as to soldiers--these
     Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,
       And found their lives were let at a short lease--
     But perish'd without shivering or shaking,
       Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
     O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi
     March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:--
     This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
       But could not eat them, being in his turn
     Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,
       Without resistance, see their city burn.
     The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
       Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
     'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
     For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.
     Another column also suffer'd much:--
       And here we may remark with the historian,
     You should but give few cartridges to such
       Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
     When matters must be carried by the touch
       Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
     They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
     Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.
     A junction of the General Meknop's men
       (Without the General, who had fallen some time
     Before, being badly seconded just then)
       Was made at length with those who dared to climb
     The death-disgorging rampart once again;
       And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
     They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
     Defended at a price extremely dear.
     Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
       Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,
     A word which little suits with Seraskiers,
       Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.
     He died, deserving well his country's tears,
       A savage sort of military martyr.
     An English naval officer, who wish'd
     To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:
     For all the answer to his proposition
       Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;
     On which the rest, without more intermission,
       Began to lay about with steel and lead--
     The pious metals most in requisition
       On such occasions: not a single head
     Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perish'd here,
     And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.
     The city 's taken--only part by part--
       And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street
     Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
       For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.
     Here War forgot his own destructive art
       In more destroying Nature; and the heat
     Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,
     Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.
     A Russian officer, in martial tread
       Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel
     Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
       Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:
     In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
       And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal--
     The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
     As do the subtle snakes described of old.
     A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
       Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit
     The very tendon which is most acute
       (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
     Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't
       He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
     Even with his life--for (but they lie) 't is said
     To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.
     However this may be, 't is pretty sure
       The Russian officer for life was lamed,
     For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
       And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
     The regimental surgeon could not cure
       His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
     More than the head of the inveterate foe,
     Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.
     But then the fact 's a fact--and 't is the part
       Of a true poet to escape from fiction
     Whene'er he can; for there is little art
       In leaving verse more free from the restriction
     Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
       For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
     And that outrageous appetite for lies
     Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.
     The city 's taken, but not render'd!--No!
       There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
     The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
       Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
     Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:
       In vain the yell of victory is roar'd
     By the advancing Muscovite--the groan
     Of the last foe is echoed by his own.
     The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,
       And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
     As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
       When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
     And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
       Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
     But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
     As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.
     It is an awful topic--but 't is not
       My cue for any time to be terrific:
     For checker'd as is seen our human lot
       With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
     Of melancholy merriment, to quote
       Too much of one sort would be soporific;--
     Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
     I sketch your world exactly as it goes.
     And one good action in the midst of crimes
       Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase
     Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
       With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,
     And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
       A little scorch'd at present with the blaze
     Of conquest and its consequences, which
     Make epic poesy so rare and rich.
     Upon a taken bastion, where there lay
       Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group
     Of murder'd women, who had found their way
       To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
     And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,
       A female child of ten years tried to stoop
     And hide her little palpitating breast
     Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.
     Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child
       With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
     The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
       Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,--
     The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
       And whom for this at last must we condemn?
     Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
     All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?
     Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
       Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
     Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
       When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
     I shall not say exactly what he said,
       Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'
     But what he did, was to lay on their backs,
     The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.
     One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,
       And drove them with their brutal yells to seek
     If there might be chirurgeons who could solder
       The wounds they richly merited, and shriek
     Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
       As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,
     Don Juan raised his little captive from
     The heap a moment more had made her tomb.
     And she was chill as they, and on her face
       A slender streak of blood announced how near
     Her fate had been to that of all her race;
       For the same blow which laid her mother here
     Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
       As the last link with all she had held dear;
     But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,
     And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.
     Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
       Upon each other, with dilated glance,
     In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd
       With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
     Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd
       With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
     A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
     Like to a lighted alabaster vase;--
     Up came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'
       For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace
     On great occasions, such as an attack
       On cities, as hath been the present case):
     Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,
       Exclaiming;--'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace
     Your arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar
     That you and I will win St. George's collar.
     'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
       But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
     The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
       Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din
     Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
       Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,
     Lie round the battery; but still it batters,
     And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.
     'Then up with me!'--But Juan answer'd, 'Look
       Upon this child--I saved her--must not leave
     Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
       Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
     And I am with you.'--Whereon Johnson took
       A glance around--and shrugg'd--and twitch'd his sleeve
     And black silk neckcloth--and replied, 'You 're right;
     Poor thing! what 's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'
     Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be
       Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
     Of present life a good deal more than we.'
       Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;
     But at the least you may die gloriously.'
       Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
     Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign
     This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'
     Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
       The child 's a pretty child--a very pretty--
     I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose
       Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;--
     Hark! how the roar increases!--no excuse
       Will serve when there is plunder in a city;--
     I should be loth to march without you, but,
     By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'
     But Juan was immovable; until
       Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
     Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill
       Such as he thought the least given up to prey;
     And swearing if the infant came to ill
       That they should all be shot on the next day;
     But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
     They should at least have fifty rubles round,
     And all allowances besides of plunder
       In fair proportion with their comrades;--then
     Juan consented to march on through thunder,
       Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:
     And yet the rest rush'd eagerly--no wonder,
       For they were heated by the hope of gain,
     A thing which happens everywhere each day--
     No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.
     And such is victory, and such is man!
       At least nine tenths of what we call so;--God
     May have another name for half we scan
       As human beings, or his ways are odd.
     But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan--
       Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod
     In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call
     This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:
     But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,
       That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
     Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),
       He never would believe the city won
     While courage clung but to a single twig.--Am I
       Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
     Neither--but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
     Who fought with his five children in the van.
     To take him was the point. The truly brave,
       When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,
     Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;--
       A mixture of wild beasts and demigods
     Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,
       Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods
     The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
     Compassion breathes along the savage mind.
     But he would not be taken, and replied
       To all the propositions of surrender
     By mowing Christians down on every side,
       As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.
     His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
       Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,
     As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
     Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.
     And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
       Expended all their Eastern phraseology
     In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
       So much less fight as might form an apology
     For them in saving such a desperate foe--
       He hew'd away, like doctors of theology
     When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
     Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.
     Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both
       Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
     The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
       Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,
     And all around were grown exceeding wroth
       At such a pertinacious infidel,
     And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
     Which they resisted like a sandy plain
     That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd--
       His second son was levell'd by a shot;
     His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
       Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;
     The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,
       Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
     Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,
     To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.
     The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
       As great a scorner of the Nazarene
     As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,
       Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
     Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
       On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
     Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
     Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.
     And what they pleased to do with the young khan
       In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
     But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
       To tough old heroes, and can do no less;
     And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
       A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
     For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,
     You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.
     Your houris also have a natural pleasure
       In lopping off your lately married men,
     Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
       And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
     Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure
       To wish him back a bachelor now and then.
     And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
     Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.
     Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,
       Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
     But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
       In short, howe'er our better faith derides,
     These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
       As though there were one heaven and none besides,--
     Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
     And hell, there must at least be six or seven.
     So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
       That when the very lance was in his heart,
     He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
       With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
     And bright eternity without disguise
       On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:--
     With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried
     In one voluptuous blaze,--and then he died,
     But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
       The good old khan, who long had ceased to see
     Houris, or aught except his florid race
       Who grew like cedars round him gloriously--
     When he beheld his latest hero grace
       The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,
     Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast
     A glance on that slain son, his first and last.
     The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,
       Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede
     Quarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'
       As he before had done. He did not heed
     Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
       And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
     As he look'd down upon his children gone,
     And felt--though done with life--he was alone
     But 't was a transient tremor;--with a spring
       Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
     As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
       Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
     Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,
       Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
     And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
     In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.
     'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who
       Spared neither sex nor age in their career
     Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
       And lay before them with his children near,
     Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,
       Were melted for a moment: though no tear
     Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
     They honour'd such determined scorn of life.
     But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
       Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
     Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
       And baffled the assaults of all their host;
     At length he condescended to inquire
       If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
     And being told the latter, sent a bey
     To answer Ribas' summons to give way.
     In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,
       Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking
     Tobacco on a little carpet;--Troy
       Saw nothing like the scene around:--yet looking
     With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy
       His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
     His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
     As if he had three lives, as well as tails.
     The town was taken--whether he might yield
       Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
     His stubborn valour was no future shield.
       Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow
     Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
       But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
     Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
     Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.
     All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
       All that the body perpetrates of bad;
     All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;
       All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
     All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
       All by which hell is peopled, or as sad
     As hell--mere mortals who their power abuse--
     Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.
     If here and there some transient trait of pity
       Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through
     Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
       Child, or an aged, helpless man or two--
     What 's this in one annihilated city,
       Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
     Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
     Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.
     Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
       Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
     Or if these do not move you, don't forget
       Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
     Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,
       Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
     Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
     Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.
     But still there is unto a patriot nation,
       Which loves so well its country and its king,
     A subject of sublimest exultation--
       Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
     Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
       Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
     Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne--
     Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.
     But let me put an end unto my theme:
       There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!
     Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
       And redly ran his blushing waters down.
     The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
       Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:
     Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
     Some hundreds breathed--the rest were silent all!
     In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
       The Russian army upon this occasion,
     A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
       And therefore worthy of commemoration:
     The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase--
       Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
     In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,
     Had made them chaste;--they ravish'd very little.
     Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
       Might here and there occur some violation
     In the other line;--but not to such excess
       As when the French, that dissipated nation,
     Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
       Except cold weather and commiseration;
     But all the ladies, save some twenty score,
     Were almost as much virgins as before.
     Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,
       Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste--
     Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark
       Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste
     Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark
       Of light to save the venerably chaste:
     But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
     Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.
     But on the whole their continence was great;
       So that some disappointment there ensued
     To those who had felt the inconvenient state
       Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
     (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
       To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
     To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
     Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.
     Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
       Were also heard to wonder in the din
     (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
       'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
     But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
       There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
     But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
     In darkness--I can only hope they did.
     Suwarrow now was conqueror--a match
       For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.
     While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch
       Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
     With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;
       And here exactly follows what he said:--
     'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers
     Eternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail 's ours.'
     Methinks these are the most tremendous words,
       Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'
     Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.
       Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
     What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,
       Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on
     The fate of nations;--but this Russ so witty
     Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.
     He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
       Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
     Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it--
       For I will teach, if possible, the stones
     To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it
       Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;--
     But ye--our children's children! think how we
     Show'd what things were before the world was free!
     That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
       And as, in the great joy of your millennium,
     You hardly will believe such things were true
       As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
     But may their very memory perish too!-
       Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em
     More than you scorn the savages of yore,
     Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.
     And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
       And those that sate upon them, let it be
     As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
       'And wonder what old world such things could see,
     Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
       The pleasant riddles of futurity--
     Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
     As the real purpose of a pyramid.
     Reader! I have kept my word,--at least so far
       As the first Canto promised. You have now
     Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war--
       All very accurate, you must allow,
     And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
       For I have drawn much less with a long bow
     Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
     But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,
     With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
       What farther hath befallen or may befall
     The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
       I by and by may tell you, if at all:
     But now I choose to break off in the middle,
       Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,
     While Juan is sent off with the despatch,
     For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.
     This special honour was conferr'd, because
       He had behaved with courage and humanity--
     Which last men like, when they have time to pause
       From their ferocities produced by vanity.
     His little captive gain'd him some applause
       For saving her amidst the wild insanity
     Of carnage,--and I think he was more glad in her
     Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.
     The Moslem orphan went with her protector,
       For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
     Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
       Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
     Her very place of birth was but a spectre
       Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal
     To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept,
     And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
[Illustration: Canto 9]
   O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'--for Fame
       Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
     France could not even conquer your great name,
       But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase--
     Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),
       You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:
     Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
     Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'
     I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
       In Marinet's affair--in fact, 't was shabby,
     And like some other things won't do to tell
       Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.
     Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
       Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;
     But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
     In fact your grace is still but a young hero.
     Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
       Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
     You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,
       A prop not quite so certain as before:
     The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
       Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
     And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
     (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).
     You are 'the best of cut-throats:'--do not start;
       The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
     War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
       Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
     If you have acted once a generous part,
       The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
     And I shall be delighted to learn who,
     Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?
     I am no flatterer--you 've supp'd full of flattery:
       They say you like it too--'t is no great wonder.
     He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
       At last may get a little tired of thunder;
     And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
       May like being praised for every lucky blunder,
     Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'--not yet saved,
     And 'Europe's Liberator'--still enslaved.
     I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
       Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,
     And send the sentinel before your gate
       A slice or two from your luxurious meals:
     He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
       Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:--
     There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
     But pray give back a little to the nation.
     I don't mean to reflect--a man so great as
       You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:
     The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
       With modern history has but small connection:
     Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
       You need not take them under your direction;
     And half a million for your Sabine farm
     Is rather dear!--I 'm sure I mean no harm.
     Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:
       Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
     Not leaving even his funeral expenses:
       George Washington had thanks and nought beside,
     Except the all-cloudless glory which few men's is
       To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
     And as a high-soul'd minister of state is
     Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.
     Never had mortal man such opportunity,
       Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
     You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
       Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
     And now--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
       Now--that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?
     Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!
     Behold the world! and curse your victories!
     As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
       To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe
     Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,
       But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
     Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
       Must be recited, and--without a bribe.
     You did great things; but not being great in mind,
     Have left undone the greatest--and mankind.
     Death laughs--Go ponder o'er the skeleton
       With which men image out the unknown thing
     That hides the past world, like to a set sun
       Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring--
     Death laughs at all you weep for:--look upon
       This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
     Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:
     Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!
     Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
       And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
     It laughs not--there is now no fleshy bar
       So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
     But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
       He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
     Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
     White, black, or copper--the dead bones will grin.
     And thus Death laughs,--it is sad merriment,
       But still it is so; and with such example
     Why should not Life be equally content
       With his superior, in a smile to trample
     Upon the nothings which are daily spent
       Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
     Than the eternal deluge, which devours
     Suns as rays--worlds like atoms--years like hours?
     'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
       Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
     I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
       Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;
     But would much rather have a sound digestion
       Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
     Through fifty victories to shame or fame--
     Without a stomach what were a good name?
     'O dura ilia messorum!'--'Oh
       Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate
     For the great benefit of those who know
       What indigestion is--that inward fate
     Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
       A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
     Let this one toil for bread--that rack for rent,
     He who sleeps best may be the most content.
     'To be, or not to be?'--Ere I decide,
       I should be glad to know that which is being?
     'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
       And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:
     For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
       Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
     For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
     Rather than life a mere affair of breath.
     'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,
       As also of the first academicians:
     That all is dubious which man may attain,
       Was one of their most favourite positions.
     There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
       As any of Mortality's conditions;
     So little do we know what we 're about in
     This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.
     It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
       Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
     But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
       Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
     And swimming long in the abyss of thought
       Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
     Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers
     Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.
     'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all--
       No more of this, then,--let us pray!' We have
     Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
       Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,
     Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
       Is special providence,' though how it gave
     Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
     Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.
     O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?
       O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?
     O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?
       Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
     And yet I know no more than the mahogany
       That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
     I comprehend, for without transformation
     Men become wolves on any slight occasion.
     But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
       Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
     Done anything exceedingly unkind,--
       And (though I could not now and then forbear
     Following the bent of body or of mind)
       Have always had a tendency to spare,--
     Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
     They hate me, not I them.--and here we 'll pause.
     'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,--
       For I maintain that it is really good,
     Not only in the body but the proem,
       However little both are understood
     Just now,--but by and by the Truth will show 'em
       Herself in her sublimest attitude:
     And till she doth, I fain must be content
     To share her beauty and her banishment.
     Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)
       Was left upon his way to the chief city
     Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors
       Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
     I know its mighty empire now allures
       Much flattery--even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.
     For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
     Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.
     And I will war, at least in words (and--should
       My chance so happen--deeds), with all who war
     With Thought;--and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
       Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.
     I know not who may conquer: if I could
       Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
     To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
     Of every depotism in every nation.
     It is not that I adulate the people:
       Without me, there are demagogues enough,
     And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
       And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
     Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,
       As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
     I do not know;--I wish men to be free
     As much from mobs as kings--from you as me.
     The consequence is, being of no party,
       I shall offend all parties: never mind!
     My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
       Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
     He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
       Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
     May still expatiate freely, as will I,
     Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.
     That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;--
       I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
     By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
       Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
     And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
       However, the poor jackals are less foul
     (As being the brave lions' keen providers)
     Than human insects, catering for spiders.
     Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
       And without that, their poison and their claws
     Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
       (Or rather peoples)--go on without pause!
     The web of these tarantulas each day
       Increases, till you shall make common cause:
     None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
     As yet are strongly stinging to be free.
     Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
       Was left upon his way with the despatch,
     Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
       And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch
     O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
       Fair Catherine's pastime--who look'd on the match
     Between these nations as a main of cocks,
     Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.
     And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
       (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
     Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),
       Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,
     And orders, and on all that he had done--
       And wishing that post-horses had the wings
     Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
     Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.
     At every jolt--and they were many--still
       He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
     As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
       Than he, in these sad highways left at large
     To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
       Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
     On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
     Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.
     At least he pays no rent, and has best right
       To be the first of what we used to call
     'Gentlemen farmer'--a race worn out quite,
       Since lately there have been no rents at all,
     And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,
       And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
     She fell with Buonaparte--What strange thoughts
     Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!
     But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
       Whom he had saved from slaughter--what a trophy
     O! ye who build up monuments, defiled
       With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,
     Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
       And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
     To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!
     Because he could no more digest his dinner;--
     O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
       That one life saved, especially if young
     Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
       Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
     From the manure of human clay, though deck'd
       With all the praises ever said or sung:
     Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
     Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.
     O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!
       Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!
     Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
       Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,
     To prove the public debt is not consuming us--
       Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'
     With clownish heel, your popular circulation
     Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;--
     O, ye great authors!--'Apropos des bottes,'-
       I have forgotten what I meant to say,
     As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
       'T was something calculated to allay
     All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
       Certes it would have been but thrown away,
     And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
     Although no doubt it was beyond all price.
     But let it go:--it will one day be found
       With other relics of 'a former world,'
     When this world shall be former, underground,
       Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
     Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
       Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
     First out of, and then back again to chaos,
     The superstratum which will overlay us.
     So Cuvier says;--and then shall come again
       Unto the new creation, rising out
     From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
       Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
     Like to the notions we now entertain
       Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
     Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
     And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.
     Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
       How the new worldlings of the then new East
     Will wonder where such animals could sup!
       (For they themselves will be but of the least:
     Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
       And every new creation hath decreased
     In size, from overworking the material--
     Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)
     How will--to these young people, just thrust out
       From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,
     And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
       And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
     Till all the arts at length are brought about,
       Especially of war and taxing,--how,
     I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
     Look like the monsters of a new museum?
     But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
       'The time is out of joint,'--and so am I;
     I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
       And deviate into matters rather dry.
     I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
       Much too poetical: men should know why
     They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
     I never know the word which will come next.
     So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
       Now pondering:--it is time we should narrate.
     I left Don Juan with his horses baiting--
       Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
     I shall not be particular in stating
       His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
     Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
     That pleasant capital of painted snows;
     Suppose him in a handsome uniform,--
       A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
     Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
       Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
     And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
       Of yellow casimere we may presume,
     White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk
     O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;
     Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
       Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor--
     That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
       Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
     Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
       (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),--
     Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
     Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:--
     His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
       His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
     Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
       His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
     His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
       But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
     Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
     If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.
     The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
       The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd--
     I quite forget which of them was in hand
       Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
     Who took by turns that difficult command
       Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
     But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
     All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.
     Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
       Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
     There was a something in his turn of limb,
       And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
     That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
       There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
     Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
     And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.
     No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,
       Or Scherbatoff, or any other off
     Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough
       Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
     For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough
       Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
     Of him who, in the language of his station,
     Then held that 'high official situation.'
     O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
       The import of this diplomatic phrase,
     Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
       His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
     Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
       Which none divine, and every one obeys,
     Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
     Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.
     I think I can explain myself without
       That sad inexplicable beast of prey--
     That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
       Did not his deeds unriddle them each day--
     That monstrous hieroglyphic--that long spout
       Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!
     And here I must an anecdote relate,
     But luckily of no great length or weight.
     An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
       What were the actual and official duties
     Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
       Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
     Called 'Cavalier servente?'--a Pygmalion
       Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)
     Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
     Said--'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'
     And thus I supplicate your supposition,
       And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
     Of the imperial favourite's condition.
       'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
     In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
       Of any one's attaining to his station,
     No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
     If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.
     Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
       And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
     The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,
       With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
     Parisian aspect which upset old Troy
       And founded Doctors' Commons:--I have conn'd
     The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
     Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.
     And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,
       Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much
     Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
       Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch
     Of sentiment; and he she most adored
       Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such
     A lover as had cost her many a tear,
     And yet but made a middling grenadier.
     O thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-
       Thou gate of life and death--thou nondescript!
     Whence is our exit and our entrance,--well I
       May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
     In thy perennial fountain:--how man fell I
       Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
     Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
     Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.
     Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
       Maintain thou art the best: for after all
     From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
       To get at thee not batter down a wall,
     Or waste a world? since no one can deny
       Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
     With, or without thee, all things at a stand
     Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!
     Catherine, who was the grand epitome
       Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
     You please (it causes all the things which be,
       So you may take your choice of this or that)--
     Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
       The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
     Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel
     With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.
     Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
       forgetting quite the woman (which composed
     At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
       The letter open with an air which posed
     The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
       Until a royal smile at length disclosed
     Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,
     Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.
     Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
       Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.
     Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
       As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
     These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst--
       So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
     In vain!--As fall the dews on quenchless sands,
     Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!
     Her next amusement was more fanciful;
       She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
     Into a Russian couplet rather dull
       The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
     Her third was feminine enough to annul
       The shudder which runs naturally through
     Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best
     To kill, and generals turn it into jest.
     The two first feelings ran their course complete,
       And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
     The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
       Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.
     But when on the lieutenant at her feet
       Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
     Almost as much as on a new despatch,
     Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.
     Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
       When wroth--while pleased, she was as fine a figure
     As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
       Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
     She could repay each amatory look you lent
       With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour
     To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
     At sight, nor would permit you to discount.
     With her the latter, though at times convenient,
       Was not so necessary; for they tell
     That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
       And always used her favourites too well.
     If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,
       Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell
     A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all
     Nations, she liked man as an individual.
     What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger
       Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
     And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
       Is all the rest about her! Whether wed
     Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her
       Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
     Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;--
     The oldest thing on record, and yet new!
     O Catherine! (for of all interjections,
       To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right
     In love and war) how odd are the connections
       Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
     Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
       First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
     Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;
     And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!
     Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury
       New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
     And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
       While her young herald knelt before her still.
     'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
       For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill
     Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing
     With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'
     Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up--
       And so they fell in love;--she with his face,
     His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
       With the first draught intoxicates apace,
     A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
       Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
     Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye
     In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.
     He, on the other hand, if not in love,
       Fell into that no less imperious passion,
     Self-love--which, when some sort of thing above
       Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
     Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'
       ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
     For one especial person out of many,
     Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.
     Besides, he was of that delighted age
       Which makes all female ages equal--when
     We don't much care with whom we may engage,
       As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
     So that we can our native sun assuage
       In the next ocean, which may flow just then,
     To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is
     Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.
     And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),
       Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
     Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,
       Because each lover look'd a sort of king,
     Made up upon an amatory pattern,
       A royal husband in all save the ring--
     Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,
     Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.
     And when you add to this, her womanhood
       In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray
     (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
       Or better, as the best examples say:
     Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
       Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
     And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
     Too wise to look through optics black or blue)--
     Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
       Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
     Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
       (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
     Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
       With other extras, which we need not mention,--
     All these, or any one of these, explain
     Enough to make a stripling very vain.
     And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
       Selfish in its beginning as its end,
     Except where 't is a mere insanity,
       A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
     Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
       On which the passion's self seems to depend:
     And hence some heathenish philosophers
     Make love the main spring of the universe.
     Besides Platonic love, besides the love
       Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
     Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,
       That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
     'Gainst reason--Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove
       With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
     The sound than sense)--beside all these pretences
     To love, there are those things which words name senses;
     Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
       Which make all bodies anxious to get out
     Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
       For such all women are at first no doubt.
     How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
       That fever which precedes the languid rout
     Of our sensations! What a curious way
     The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!
     The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
       To end or to begin with; the next grand
     Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,
       Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
     The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
       As flourishing in every Christian land,
     Is when chaste matrons to their other ties
     Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.
     Well, we won't analyse--our story must
       Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
     Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;--
       I cannot stop to alter words once written,
     And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
       That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
     But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
     Behaved no better than a common sempstress.
     The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
       And all lips were applied unto all ears!
     The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
       As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
     On one another, and each lovely lisper
       Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears
     Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
     Of all the standing army who stood by.
     All the ambassadors of all the powers
       Enquired, Who was this very new young man,
     Who promised to be great in some few hours?
       Which is full soon--though life is but a span.
     Already they beheld the silver showers
       Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
     Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
     Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.
     Catherine was generous,--all such ladies are:
       Love, that great opener of the heart and all
     The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
       Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,--
     Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
       And was not the best wife, unless we call
     Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
     That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)--
     Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
       Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
     Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
       If history, the grand liar, ever saith
     The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
       Because she put a favourite to death,
     Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
     And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.
     But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
       In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
     Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
       Round the young man with their congratulations.
     Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
       Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
     It is to speculate on handsome faces,
     Especially when such lead to high places.
     Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
       A general object of attention, made
     His answers with a very graceful bow,
       As if born for the ministerial trade.
     Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow
       Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
     Little, but to the purpose; and his manner
     Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.
     An order from her majesty consign'd
       Our young lieutenant to the genial care
     Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
       (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
     Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),
       As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
     Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
     A term inexplicable to the Muse.
     With her then, as in humble duty bound,
       Juan retired,--and so will I, until
     My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
       We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
     So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
       And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
     Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
     To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.
[Illustration: Canto 10]
   When Newton saw an apple fall, he found
       In that slight startle from his contemplation--
     'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground
       For any sage's creed or calculation)--
     A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
       In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'
     And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
     Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.
     Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,
       If this be true; for we must deem the mode
     In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
       Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
     A thing to counterbalance human woes:
       For ever since immortal man hath glow'd
     With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
     Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.
     And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,
       In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,
     My bosom underwent a glorious glow,
       And my internal spirit cut a caper:
     And though so much inferior, as I know,
       To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,
     Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,
     I wish to do as much by poesy.
     In the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for
       The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
     But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,
       And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
     The ocean of eternity: the roar
       Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,
     But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
     Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.
     We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom
       Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;
     And far be it from my Muses to presume
       (For I have more than one Muse at a push)
     To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
       It is enough that Fortune found him flush
     Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things
     Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.
     But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
       'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's
     Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'
       And who that recollects young years and loves,--
     Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
       And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
     Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,--but would much rather
     Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?
     But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
       Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,
     So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
       Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!
     Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think
       Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;
     No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,
     Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.
     But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now
       And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
     Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow
       Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun
     Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,
       Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
     O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,
     Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!
     But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
       We left him in the focus of such glory
     As may be won by favour of the moon
       Or ladies' fancies--rather transitory
     Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
       Because December, with his breath so hoary,
     Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,
     To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.
     Besides, he had some qualities which fix
       Middle-aged ladies even more than young:
     The former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks
       Know little more of love than what is sung
     In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)
       In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
     Some reckon women by their suns or years,
     I rather think the moon should date the dears.
     And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
       I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
     Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
       May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
     Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'
       As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
     However, I forgive him, and I trust
     He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.
     Old enemies who have become new friends
       Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;
     And I know nothing which could make amends
       For a return to hatred: I would shun her
     Like garlic, howsoever she extends
       Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
     Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--
     Converted foes should scorn to join with those.
     This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,
       Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,
     Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'
       Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:
     And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
       Whether in Caledon or Italy,
     Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
     To pain, the moment when you cease to please.
     The lawyer and the critic but behold
       The baser sides of literature and life,
     And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
       By those who scour those double vales of strife.
     While common men grow ignorantly old,
       The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
     Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
     And with it all the process of digestion.
     A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
       And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
     The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper
       Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he
     Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
       At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
     In all their habits;--not so you, I own;
     As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.
     And all our little feuds, at least all mine,
       Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
     (As far as rhyme and criticism combine
       To make such puppets of us things below),
     Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       I do not know you, and may never know
     Your face--but you have acted on the whole
     Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.
     And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       'T is not address'd to you--the more 's the pity
     For me, for I would rather take my wine
       With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.
     But somehow,--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
       And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
     But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
     A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,--
     As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
       Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,
     The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,
       All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams
     Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,
       Like Banquo's offspring;--floating past me seems
     My childhood in this childishness of mine:
     I care not--'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'
     And though, as you remember, in a fit
       Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,
     I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
       Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,
     Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,
       They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
     I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,
     And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'
     Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--
       For both are much the same, since what men think
     Exists when the once thinkers are less real
       Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,
     And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;
       And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
     Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,
     And know no more of what is here, than there;--
     Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian--
       How we won't mention, why we need not say:
     Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
       Of any slight temptation in their way;
     But his just now were spread as is a cushion
       Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay
     Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
     Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.
     The favour of the empress was agreeable;
       And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
     Young people at his time of life should be able
       To come off handsomely in that regard.
     He was now growing up like a green tree, able
       For love, war, or ambition, which reward
     Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
     Make some prefer the circulating medium.
     About this time, as might have been anticipated,
       Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,
     Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
       Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples
     On our fresh feelings, but--as being participated
       With all kinds of incorrigible samples
     Of frail humanity--must make us selfish,
     And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.
     This we pass over. We will also pass
       The usual progress of intrigues between
     Unequal matches, such as are, alas!
       A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,
     But one who is not so youthful as she was
       In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.
     Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,
     And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great
       Gracchus of all mortality, who levels
     With his Agrarian laws the high estate
       Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,
     To one small grass-grown patch (which must await
       Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils
     Who never had a foot of land till now,--
     Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.
     He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
       Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
     In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry--
       Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)
     Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,
       Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter
     For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot--
     And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.
     And this same state we won't describe: we would
       Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;
     But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
       That horrid equinox, that hateful section
     Of human years, that half-way house, that rude
       Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection
     Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier
     Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;--
     I won't describe,--that is, if I can help
       Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,
     If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp
       Clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss
     Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
       Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
     Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,
     I won't philosophise, and will be read.
     Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--
       A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
     Much to his youth, and much to his reported
       Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,
     Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
       Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,
     As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
     He owed to an old woman and his post.
     He wrote to Spain:--and all his near relations,
       Perceiving fie was in a handsome way
     Of getting on himself, and finding stations
       For cousins also, answer'd the same day.
     Several prepared themselves for emigrations;
       And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,
     That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
     Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.
     His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
       That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,
     Where his assets were waxing rather few,
       He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--
     Replied, 'that she was glad to see him through
       Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
     As the sole sign of man's being in his senses
     Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.
     'She also recommended him to God,
       And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
     Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd
       In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother
     Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;
       Inform'd him that he had a little brother
     Born in a second wedlock; and above
     All, praised the empress's maternal love.
     'She could not too much give her approbation
       Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men
     Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation
       And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):--
     At home it might have given her some vexation;
       But where thermometers sunk down to ten,
     Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
     Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'
     O for a forty-parson power to chant
       Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
     Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,
       Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!
     Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,
       Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
     Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
     When she no more could read the pious print.
     She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
       But went to heaven in as sincere a way
     As any body on the elected roll,
       Which portions out upon the judgment day
     Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,
       Such as the conqueror William did repay
     His knights with, lotting others' properties
     Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.
     I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
       Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors
     (If that my memory doth not greatly err)
       Were their reward for following Billy's banners:
     And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
       To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;
     Yet as they founded churches with the produce,
     You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.
     The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times
       He felt like other plants called sensitive,
     Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,
       Save such as Southey can afford to give.
     Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes
       In which the Neva's ice would cease to live
     Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
     In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:
     Perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek
       For causes young or old: the canker-worm
     Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,
       As well as further drain the wither'd form:
     Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week
       His bills in, and however we may storm,
     They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
     The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.
     I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:
       The empress was alarm'd, and her physician
     (The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick
       Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
     Which augur'd of the dead, however quick
       Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;
     At which the whole court was extremely troubled,
     The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.
     Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:
       Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;
     Others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,
       Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;
     Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,
       Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;
     Others again were ready to maintain,
     ''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'
     But here is one prescription out of many:
       'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.
     Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae
       Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)
     'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'
       (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).
     'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,
     Et haustus ter in die capiendus.'
     This is the way physicians mend or end us,
       Secundum artem: but although we sneer
     In health--when ill, we call them to attend us,
       Without the least propensity to jeer:
     While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'
       To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,
     Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,
     We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.
     Juan demurr'd at this first notice to
       Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,
     His youth and constitution bore him through,
       And sent the doctors in a new direction.
     But still his state was delicate: the hue
       Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection
     Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
     The faculty--who said that he must travel.
     The climate was too cold, they said, for him,
       Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion
     Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,
       Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
     But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,
       And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
     She then resolved to send him on a mission,
     But in a style becoming his condition.
     There was just then a kind of a discussion,
       A sort of treaty or negotiation
     Between the British cabinet and Russian,
       Maintain'd with all the due prevarication
     With which great states such things are apt to push on;
       Something about the Baltic's navigation,
     Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
     Which Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'
     So Catherine, who had a handsome way
       Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd
     This secret charge on Juan, to display
       At once her royal splendour, and reward
     His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
       Received instructions how to play his card,
     Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,
     Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.
     But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens
       Are generally prosperous in reigning;
     Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.
       But to continue: though her years were waning
     Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
       And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,
     So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
     She could not find at first a fit successor.
     But time, the comforter, will come at last;
       And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
     Of candidates requesting to be placed,
       Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--
     Not that she meant to fix again in haste,
       Nor did she find the quantity encumber,
     But always choosing with deliberation,
     Kept the place open for their emulation.
     While this high post of honour 's in abeyance,
       For one or two days, reader, we request
     You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance
       Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best
     Barouche, which had the glory to display once
       The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
     When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,
     Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.
     A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,
       All private favourites of Don Juan;--for
     (Let deeper sages the true cause determine)
       He had a kind of inclination, or
     Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,
       Live animals: an old maid of threescore
     For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,
     Although he was not old, nor even a maid;--
     The animals aforesaid occupied
       Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
     In other vehicles; but at his side
       Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
     He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
       Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
     Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
     Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl
     Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
       And with that gentle, serious character,
     As rare in living beings as a fossile
       Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'
     Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
       With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:
     But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
     Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.
     Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
       Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.
     I cannot tell exactly what it was;
       He was not yet quite old enough to prove
     Parental feelings, and the other class,
       Call'd brotherly affection, could not move
     His bosom,--for he never had a sister:
     Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!
     And still less was it sensual; for besides
       That he was not an ancient debauchee
     (Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,
       As acids rouse a dormant alkali),
     Although ('t will happen as our planet guides)
       His youth was not the chastest that might be,
     There was the purest Platonism at bottom
     Of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em.
     Just now there was no peril of temptation;
       He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
     As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
       His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
     Owing to him;--as also her salvation
       Through his means and the church's might be paved.
     But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
     The little Turk refused to be converted.
     'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
       Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
     But though three bishops told her the transgression,
       She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
     She also had no passion for confession;
       Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,
     Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it--
     She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.
     In fact, the only Christian she could bear
       Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected
     In place of what her home and friends once were.
       He naturally loved what he protected:
     And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
       A guardian green in years, a ward connected
     In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;
     And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.
     They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,
       Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:
     Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
       Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'
     'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
       Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!
     To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
     Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.
     Let this not seem an anti-climax:--'Oh!
       My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.
     Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
       Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!
     Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!
       But should we wish to warm us on our way
     Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
     Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.
     From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,
       And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,
     Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
       Has lately been the great Professor Kant.
     Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
       About philosophy, pursued his jaunt
     To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions
     Have princes who spur more than their postilions.
     And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
       Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:--
     Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike
       All phantasies, not even excepting mine;
     A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
       Make my soul pass the equinoctial line
     Between the present and past worlds, and hover
     Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.
     But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,
       Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre
     Of the good feudal times forever gone,
       On which I have not time just now to lecture.
     From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,
       A city which presents to the inspector
     Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,
     The greatest number flesh hath ever known.
     From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,
       That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,
     Where juniper expresses its best juice,
       The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.
     Senates and sages have condemn'd its use--
       But to deny the mob a cordial, which is
     Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,
     Good government has left them, seems but cruel.
     Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
       Went bounding for the island of the free,
     Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;
       High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,
     And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
       But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
     By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs
     Which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.
     At length they rose, like a white wall along
       The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt--
     What even young strangers feel a little strong
       At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt--
     A kind of pride that he should be among
       Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
     Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
     And made the very billows pay them toll.
     I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
       Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
     But though I owe it little but my birth,
       I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
     For its decaying fame and former worth.
       Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
     Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
     When a man's country 's going to the devil.
     Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
       How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
     How eager all the earth is for the blow
       Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
     How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
       That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
     False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,
     And now would chain them, to the very mind:--
     Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
       Who is but first of slaves? The nations are
     In prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?
       No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
     Is the poor privilege to turn the key
       Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far
     From the enjoyment of the earth and air
     Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.
     Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
       Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;
     Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;
       Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
     Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
       To those who upon land or water dwell;
     And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
     Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.
     Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,
       And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
     Who did not limit much his bills per week,
       Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it
     (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,
       Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);
     But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,
     Is free, the respiration's worth the money.
     On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
       Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;
     Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
       Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle
     Along the road, as if they went to bury
       Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
     With 'schnapps'--sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'
     Affect no more than lightning a conductor.
     Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,
       Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,
     As going at full speed--no matter where its
       Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
     And merely for the sake of its own merits;
       For the less cause there is for all this flurry,
     The greater is the pleasure in arriving
     At the great end of travel--which is driving.
     They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
       Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
     Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,
       In the same quaint, uninterested tone:--
     There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
       Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,
     Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;
     Which form that bitter draught, the human species.
     The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
       He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
     That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.
       Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,
     Who died in the then great attempt to climb
       O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law
     Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
     And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:
     And being told it was 'God's house,' she said
       He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
     He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
       The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
     His holy temples in the lands which bred
       The True Believers:--and her infant brow
     Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign
     A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.
     O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,
       A paradise of hops and high production;
     For after years of travel by a bard in
       Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,
     A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
       The absence of that more sublime construction,
     Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,
     Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.
     And when I think upon a pot of beer--
       But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!
     As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,
       Juan admired these highways of free millions;
     A country in all senses the most dear
       To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
     Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,
     And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.
     What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
       So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
     The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
       Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
     Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
       Had told his son to satisfy his craving
     With the York mail;--but onward as we roll,
     'Surgit amari aliquid'--the toll
     Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!
       Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:
     As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,
       Such is the shortest way to general curses.
     They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
       On that sweet ore which every body nurses;--
     Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
     But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.
     So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken
       To your instructor. Juan now was borne,
     Just as the day began to wane and darken,
       O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn
     Toward the great city.--Ye who have a spark in
       Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn
     According as you take things well or ill;--
     Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!
     The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
       A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space
     Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'
       As some have qualified that wondrous place:
     But Juan felt, though not approaching home,
       As one who, though he were not of the race,
     Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,
     Who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.
     A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,
       Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye
     Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping
       In sight, then lost amidst the forestry
     Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping
       On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;
     A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown
     On a fool's head--and there is London Town!
     But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
       Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour
     Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
       The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
     The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
       Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,
     Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,
     Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.
     He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew
       Before they give their broadside. By and by,
     My gentle countrymen, we will renew
       Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try
     To tell you truths you will not take as true,
       Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,
     With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,
     And brush a web or two from off the walls.
     O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
       Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin
     With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
       Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.
     To mend the people 's an absurdity,
       A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
     Unless you make their betters better:--Fy!
     I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.
     Teach them the decencies of good threescore;
       Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;
     Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,
       That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;
     Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,
       Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,
     The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
     A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.
     Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,
       On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
     To set up vain pretence of being great,
       'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
     The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
       And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated
     Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
     Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.
[Illustration: Canto 11]
   When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'
       And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:
     They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
       Too subtle for the airiest human head;
     And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
       Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,
     Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,
     And wear my head, denying that I wear it.
     What a sublime discovery 't was to make the
       Universe universal egotism,
     That all 's ideal--all ourselves: I 'll stake the
       World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.
     O Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;
       But which I doubt extremely--thou sole prism
     Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
     Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.
     For ever and anon comes Indigestion,
       (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes
     Our soarings with another sort of question:
       And that which after all my spirit vexes,
     Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,
       Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,
     Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,
     The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder--
     If it be chance; or if it be according
       To the old text, still better:--lest it should
     Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,
       As several people think such hazards rude.
     They 're right; our days are too brief for affording
       Space to dispute what no one ever could
     Decide, and every body one day will
     Know very clearly--or at least lie still.
     And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
       Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
     If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
       Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
     The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
       I don't know what the reason is--the air
     Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
     Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.
     The first attack at once proved the Divinity
       (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
     The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
       The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
     The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity
       On so uncontrovertible a level,
     That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,
     On purpose to believe so much the more.
     To our Theme.--The man who has stood on the Acropolis,
       And look'd down over Attica; or he
     Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,
       Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea
     In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,
       Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,
     May not think much of London's first appearance--
     But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?
     Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
     Which looks along that vale of good and ill
       Where London streets ferment in full activity;
     While every thing around was calm and still,
       Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he
     Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
     Of cities, that boil over with their scum:--
     I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,
       Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,
     And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
       Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.
     'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;
       Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
     Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection
     Awaits it, each new meeting or election.
     'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
       But what they please; and if that things be dear,
     'T is only that they love to throw away
       Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
     Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
       Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:
     Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
     With,--'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'
     These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
       In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
     Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,
       Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
     In which the heedless gentleman who gads
       Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,
     May find himself within that isle of riches
     Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.
     Juan, who did not understand a word
       Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'
     And even that he had so rarely heard,
       He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
     Or 'God be with you!'--and 't is not absurd
       To think so: for half English as I am
     (To my misfortune), never can I say
     I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;--
     Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
       And being somewhat choleric and sudden,
     Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
       And fired it into one assailant's pudding--
     Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
       And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
     Unto his nearest follower or henchman,
     'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'
     On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
       And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,
     Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
       And offering, as usual, late assistance.
     Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed
       As if his veins would pour out his existence,
     Stood calling out for bandages and lint,
     And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.
     'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont
       To welcome foreigners in this way: now
     I recollect some innkeepers who don't
       Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
     In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.
       But what is to be done? I can't allow
     The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
     So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'
     But ere they could perform this pious duty,
       The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!
     O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;
       Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel
     Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
       The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill
     His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied
     A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'--and died.
     The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down
       Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
     Exactly why it was before him thrown,
       Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.
     Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,
       A thorough varmint, and a real swell,
     Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,
     His pockets first and then his body riddled.
     Don Juan, having done the best he could
       In all the circumstances of the case,
     As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued
       His travels to the capital apace;--
     Esteeming it a little hard he should
       In twelve hours' time, and very little space,
     Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native
     In self-defence: this made him meditative.
     He from the world had cut off a great man,
       Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
     Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
       Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
     Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)
       On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
     Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),
     So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?
     But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.
       Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
     Not long before the most of them go home.
       Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is
     That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
       In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
     Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
     Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;--
     Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
       (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
     Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
       Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
     Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
       With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;
     Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
     Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;--
     Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
       Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
     Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
       There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
     There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
       In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
     Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
     (For in those days we had not got to gas);--
     Through this, and much, and more, is the approach
       Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
     Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
       With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
     I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
       Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun
     Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
     Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,--
     That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis--
       Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,
     Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
       The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
     The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is
       A spectral resident--whose pallid beam
     In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile--
     Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.
     The Druids' groves are gone--so much the better:
       Stone-Henge is not--but what the devil is it?-
     But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
       That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
     The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;
       The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
     To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
     But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.
     The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
       Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
     Like gold as in comparison to dross,
       Match'd with the Continent's illumination,
     Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.
       The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,
     And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,
     Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.
     A row of gentlemen along the streets
       Suspended may illuminate mankind,
     As also bonfires made of country seats;
       But the old way is best for the purblind:
     The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
       A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,
     Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,
     Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.
     But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
       Could recommence to hunt his honest man,
     And found him not amidst the various progenies
       Of this enormous city's spreading span,
     'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his
       Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,
     I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,
     But see the world is only one attorney.
     Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,
       Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner
     As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell
       Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner
     Admitted a small party as night fell,--
       Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
     Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,
     St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'
     They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door
       A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
     The mob stood, and as usual several score
       Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
     In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;
       Commodious but immoral, they are found
     Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-
     But Juan now is stepping from his carriage
     Into one of the sweetest of hotels,
       Especially for foreigners--and mostly
     For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,
       And cannot find a bill's small items costly.
     There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
       (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),
     Until to some conspicuous square they pass,
     And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.
     Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
       Private, though publicly important, bore
     No title to point out with due precision
       The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.
     'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
       A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
     Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said
     (In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.
     Some rumour also of some strange adventures
       Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
     And as romantic heads are pretty painters,
       And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves
     Into the excursive, breaking the indentures
       Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,
     He found himself extremely in the fashion,
     Which serves our thinking people for a passion.
     I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
       The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
     Yet as the consequences are as bright
       As if they acted with the heart instead,
     What after all can signify the site
       Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
     In safety to the place for which you start,
     What matters if the road be head or heart?
     Juan presented in the proper place,
       To proper placemen, every Russ credential;
     And was received with all the due grimace
       By those who govern in the mood potential,
     Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,
       Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)
     That they as easily might do the youngster,
     As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.
     They err'd, as aged men will do; but by
       And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,
     'T will be because our notion is not high
       Of politicians and their double front,
     Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:--
       Now what I love in women is, they won't
     Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it
     So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.
     And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
       The truth in masquerade; and I defy
     Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put
       A fact without some leaven of a lie.
     The very shadow of true Truth would shut
       Up annals, revelations, poesy,
     And prophecy--except it should be dated
     Some years before the incidents related.
     Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now
       Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?
     She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow
       Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh
     Is idle; let us like most others bow,
       Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,
     After the good example of 'Green Erin,'
     Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.
     Don Juan was presented, and his dress
       And mien excited general admiration--
     I don't know which was more admired or less:
       One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
     Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'
       (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)
     Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
     And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.
     Besides the ministers and underlings,
       Who must be courteous to the accredited
     Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
       Until their royal riddle 's fully read,
     The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs
       Of office, or the house of office, fed
     By foul corruption into streams,--even they
     Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:
     And insolence no doubt is what they are
       Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,
     In the dear offices of peace or war;
       And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
     When for a passport, or some other bar
       To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
     If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,
     But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-
       These phrases of refinement I must borrow
     From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
       There is a move set down for joy or sorrow
     Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man
       In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,
     More than on continents--as if the sea
     (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.
     And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
       Your continental oaths are but incontinent,
     And turn on things which no aristocratic
       Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent
     This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
       In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:--
     But 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring--
     Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.
     For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
       For true or false politeness (and scarce that
     Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam--
       The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
     You leave behind, the next of much you come
       To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
     On general topics: poems must confine
     Themselves to unity, like this of mine.
     In the great world,--which, being interpreted,
       Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,
     And about twice two thousand people bred
       By no means to be very wise or witty,
     But to sit up while others lie in bed,
       And look down on the universe with pity,--
     Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
     Was well received by persons of condition.
     He was a bachelor, which is a matter
       Of import both to virgin and to bride,
     The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;
       And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)
     'T is also of some moment to the latter:
       A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
     Requires decorum, and is apt to double
     The horrid sin--and what 's still worse, the trouble.
     But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,
       And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
     An air as sentimental as Mozart's
       Softest of melodies; and could be sad
     Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'
       Just at the proper time; and though a lad,
     Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,
     And very much unlike what people write.
     Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames
       Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
     For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
       The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
     Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
       Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
     Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
     Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.
     The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'
       Throughout the season, upon speculation
     Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses
       Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
     Thought such an opportunity as this is,
       Of a rich foreigner's initiation,
     Not to be overlook'd--and gave such credit,
     That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.
     The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,
       And with the pages of the last Review
     Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,
       Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
     They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its
       Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;
     And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
     And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?
     Juan, who was a little superficial,
       And not in literature a great Drawcansir,
     Examined by this learned and especial
       Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
     His duties warlike, loving or official,
       His steady application as a dancer,
     Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
     Which now he found was blue instead of green.
     However, he replied at hazard, with
       A modest confidence and calm assurance,
     Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,
       And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
     That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith
       (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'
     Into as furious English), with her best look,
     Set down his sayings in her common-place book.
     Juan knew several languages--as well
       He might--and brought them up with skill, in time
     To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,
       Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.
     There wanted but this requisite to swell
       His qualities (with them) into sublime:
     Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,
     Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.
     However, he did pretty well, and was
       Admitted as an aspirant to all
     The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
       At great assemblies or in parties small,
     He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
       That being about their average numeral;
     Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'
     As every paltry magazine can show its.
     In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'
       Like to the champion in the fisty ring,
     Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,
       Although 't is an imaginary thing.
     Even I--albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,
       Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king--
     Was reckon'd a considerable time,
     The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.
     But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
       My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:
     'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,
       Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:
     But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
       Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;
     Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,
     With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.
     Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell
       Before and after; but now grown more holy,
     The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
       With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;
     And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble
       Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
     Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
     A modern Ancient Pistol--by the hilts?
     Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
       Sets up for being a sort of moral me;
     He 'll find it rather difficult some day
       To turn out both, or either, it may be.
     Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
       And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
     And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
     Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.
     John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,
       Just as he really promised something great,
     If not intelligible, without Greek
       Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
     Much as they might have been supposed to speak.
       Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
     'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
     Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.
     The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
       To that which none will gain--or none will know
     The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
       His last award, will have the long grass grow
     Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
       If I might augur, I should rate but low
     Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
     Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.
     This is the literary lower empire,
       Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;--
     A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
       The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
     With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.
       Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,
     I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,
     And show them what an intellectual war is.
     I think I know a trick or two, would turn
       Their flanks;--but it is hardly worth my while
     With such small gear to give myself concern:
       Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;
     My natural temper 's really aught but stern,
       And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;
     And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
     And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.
     My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril
       Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past
     With some small profit through that field so sterile,
       Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,
     Left it before he had been treated very ill;
       And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
     Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
     The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.
     His morns he pass'd in business--which, dissected,
       Was like all business a laborious nothing
     That leads to lassitude, the most infected
       And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,
     And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
       And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
     All kinds of toil, save for our country's good--
     Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.
     His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
       Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour
     In riding round those vegetable puncheons
       Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower
     Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;
       But after all it is the only 'bower'
     (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair
     Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.
     Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
       Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
     Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd
       Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor
     Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;
       Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
     Which opens to the thousand happy few
     An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'
     There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
       With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,
     The only dance which teaches girls to think,
       Makes one in love even with its very faults.
     Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,
       And long the latest of arrivals halts,
     'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,
     And gain an inch of staircase at a time.
     Thrice happy he who, after a survey
       Of the good company, can win a corner,
     A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
       Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
     And let the Babel round run as it may,
       And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
     Or an approver, or a mere spectator,
     Yawning a little as the night grows later.
     But this won't do, save by and by; and he
       Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
     Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
       Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
     He deems it is his proper place to be;
       Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
     Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill
     Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.
     Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views
       Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,
     Let him take care that that which he pursues
       Is not at once too palpably descried.
     Full many an eager gentleman oft rues
       His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
     Amongst a people famous for reflection,
     Who like to play the fool with circumspection.
     But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
       Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:--
     O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper
       In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,
     Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,
       The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill
     Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
     Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.
     But these precautionary hints can touch
       Only the common run, who must pursue,
     And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
       Or little overturns; and not the few
     Or many (for the number's sometimes such)
       Whom a good mien, especially if new,
     Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,
     Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.
     Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,
       Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
     Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,
       Before he can escape from so much danger
     As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
       Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'
     And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;--
     I wish they knew the life of a young noble.
     They are young, but know not youth--it is anticipated;
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;
     Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
       Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;
     Both senates see their nightly votes participated
       Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
     And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
     The family vault receives another lord.
     'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty--'Where
       The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!
     Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there--
       I look for it--'t is gone, a globe of glass!
     Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere
       A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.
     Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,
     And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.
     Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.
       Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:
     Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
       Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?
     Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
       And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
     Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?
     And where--oh, where the devil are the rents?
     Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.
       Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?
     Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)
       And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
     Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled
       Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:
     'Caw me, caw thee'--for six months hath been hatching
     This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.
     Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?
       The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?
     Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,
       Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is
     An evolution oft performed of late).
       Where are the Dublin shouts--and London hisses?
     Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where
     My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.
     Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?
       Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals
     So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,--
       Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
     Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
       Of fashion,--say what streams now fill those channels?
     Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
     Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.
     Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
       Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
     Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
       Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;
     Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:
       In short, the list of alterations bothers.
     There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
     The unusual quickness of these common changes.
     Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
       I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to
     The humblest individual under heaven,
       Than might suffice a moderate century through.
     I knew that nought was lasting, but now even
       Change grows too changeable, without being new:
     Nought 's permanent among the human race,
     Except the Whigs not getting into place.
     I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,
       Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
     (No matter which) turn politician stupider,
       If that can well be, than his wooden look.
     But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
       And sail for a new theme:--I have seen--and shook
     To see it--the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;
     But don't pretend to settle which was best.
     I have seen the Landholders without a rap--
       I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have seen--
     The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap--
       I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen--
     I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap--
       I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean--
     I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
     Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.
     I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
       Interminable--not eternal--speakers--
     I have seen the funds at war with house and land--
       I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers--
     I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
       By slaves on horseback--I have seen malt liquors
     Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull--
     I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-
     But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
       To-morrow sees another race as gay
     And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.
       'Life 's a poor player,'--then 'play out the play,
     Ye villains!' above all keep a sharp eye
       Much less on what you do than what you say:
     Be hypocritical, be cautious, be
     Not what you seem, but always what you see.
     But how shall I relate in other cantos
       Of what befell our hero in the land,
     Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as
       A moral country? But I hold my hand--
     For I disdain to write an Atalantis;
       But 't is as well at once to understand,
     You are not a moral people, and you know it
     Without the aid of too sincere a poet.
     What Juan saw and underwent shall be
       My topic, with of course the due restriction
     Which is required by proper courtesy;
       And recollect the work is only fiction,
     And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
       Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
     Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt
     This--when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
     Whether he married with the third or fourth
       Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
     Or whether with some virgin of more worth
       (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)
     He took to regularly peopling Earth,
       Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,--
     Or whether he was taken in for damages,
     For being too excursive in his homages,--
     Is yet within the unread events of time.
       Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back
     Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
       For being as much the subject of attack
     As ever yet was any work sublime,
       By those who love to say that white is black.
     So much the better!--I may stand alone,
     But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.
[Illustration: Canto 12]
   Of all the barbarous middle ages, that
       Which is most barbarous is the middle age
     Of man; it is--I really scarce know what;
       But when we hover between fool and sage,
     And don't know justly what we would be at--
       A period something like a printed page,
     Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
     Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;--
     Too old for youth,--too young, at thirty-five,
       To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,--
     I wonder people should be left alive;
       But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
     Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;
       And as for other love, the illusion 's o'er;
     And money, that most pure imagination,
     Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.
     O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
       Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
     Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
       Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
     Ye who but see the saving man at table,
       And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
     And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
     Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.
     Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
       Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
     But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
       And adding still a little through each cross
     (Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,
       The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.
     O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
     Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.
     Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign
       O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?
     Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?
       (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)
     Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain
       Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?
     The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-
     Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.
     Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
       Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan
     Is not a merely speculative hit,
       But seats a nation or upsets a throne.
     Republics also get involved a bit;
       Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown
     On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,
     Must get itself discounted by a Jew.
     Why call the miser miserable? as
       I said before: the frugal life is his,
     Which in a saint or cynic ever was
       The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
     Canonization for the self-same cause,
       And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
     Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;--
     Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.
     He is your only poet;--passion, pure
       And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
     Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure
       Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
     Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;
       On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
     While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies
     Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.
     The lands on either side are his; the ship
       From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads
     For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
       Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
     And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
       His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
     While he, despising every sensual call,
     Commands--the intellectual lord of all.
     Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
       To build a college, or to found a race,
     A hospital, a church,--and leave behind
       Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
     Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
       Even with the very ore which makes them base;
     Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
     Or revel in the joys of calculation.
     But whether all, or each, or none of these
       May be the hoarder's principle of action,
     The fool will call such mania a disease:--
       What is his own? Go--look at each transaction,
     Wars, revels, loves--do these bring men more ease
       Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?
     Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!
     Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours--who 's wiser?
     How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
       Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins
     (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests
       Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,
     But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests
       Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
     Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:--
     Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.
     'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'--'for love
       Is heaven, and heaven is love:'--so sings the bard;
     Which it were rather difficult to prove
       (A thing with poetry in general hard).
     Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'
       At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared
     To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)
     If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.
     But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
       Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;
     Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
       Without cash, Malthus tells you--'take no brides.'
     So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
       High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
     And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey
     Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.
     Is not all love prohibited whatever,
       Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,
     After a sort; but somehow people never
       With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
     Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
       And marriage also may exist without;
     But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
     And ought to go by quite another name.
     Now if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not
       Recruited all with constant married men,
     Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,
       I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;--
     Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,
       So celebrated for his morals, when
     My Jeffrey held him up as an example
     To me;--of whom these morals are a sample.
     Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,
       And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,
     The only time when much success is needed:
       And my success produced what I, in sooth,
     Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded--
       Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,
     Of late the penalty of such success,
     But have not learn'd to wish it any less.
     That suit in Chancery,--which some persons plead
       In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,
     In the faith of their procreative creed,
       Baptize posterity, or future clay,--
     To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
       To lean on for support in any way;
     Since odds are that posterity will know
     No more of them, than they of her, I trow.
     Why, I 'm posterity--and so are you;
       And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
     Were every memory written down all true,
       The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;
     Even Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,
       And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;
     And Mitford in the nineteenth century
     Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.
     Good people all, of every degree,
       Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,
     In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
       As serious as if I had for inditers
     Malthus and Wilberforce:--the last set free
       The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;
     While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,
     And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.
     I 'm serious--so are all men upon paper;
       And why should I not form my speculation,
     And hold up to the sun my little taper?
       Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation
     On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
       While sages write against all procreation,
     Unless a man can calculate his means
     Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.
     That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,
       I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is
     (Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,
       Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,
     If that politeness set it not apart;
       But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)--
     I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'
     Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.
     And now to business.--O my gentle Juan,
       Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,
     Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,
       Which can await warm youth in its wild race.
     'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
       Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
     Of early life; but this is a new land,
     Which foreigners can never understand.
     What with a small diversity of climate,
       Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
     I could send forth my mandate like a primate
       Upon the rest of Europe's social state;
     But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,
       Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.
     All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the
     There is but one superb menagerie.
     But I am sick of politics. Begin,
       'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided
     Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'
       Above the ice had like a skater glided:
     When tired of play, he flirted without sin
       With some of those fair creatures who have prided
     Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
     And hate all vice except its reputation.
     But these are few, and in the end they make
       Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
     That even the purest people may mistake
       Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;
     And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
       To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows
     Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)
     With the kind world's amen--'Who would have thought it?'
     The little Leila, with her orient eyes,
       And taciturn Asiatic disposition
     (Which saw all western things with small surprise,
       To the surprise of people of condition,
     Who think that novelties are butterflies
       To be pursued as food for inanition),
     Her charming figure and romantic history
     Became a kind of fashionable mystery.
     The women much divided--as is usual
       Amongst the sex in little things or great.
     Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all--
       I have always liked you better than I state:
     Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
       Of being apt to talk at a great rate;
     And now there was a general sensation
     Amongst you, about Leila's education.
     In one point only were you settled--and
       You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,
     As beautiful as her own native land,
       And far away, the last bud of her race,
     Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
       Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
     Would be much better taught beneath the eye
     Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.
     So first there was a generous emulation,
       And then there was a general competition,
     To undertake the orphan's education.
       As Juan was a person of condition,
     It had been an affront on this occasion
       To talk of a subscription or petition;
     But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,
     Whose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'
     And one or two sad, separate wives, without
       A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough--
     Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-
       For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,
     Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
       And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
     And I assure you, that like virgin honey
     Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).
     How all the needy honourable misters,
       Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
     The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters
       (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy
     At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'
       Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy
     Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,
     To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!
     Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
       Nay, married dames will now and then discover
     Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
       I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
     'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
       Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'
     While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
     Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.
     Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
       'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
     And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
       (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,
     Such as--'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen
       Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals
     To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
     Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?
     'Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
       'T was not her fortune--he has enough without:
     The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
       So good an opportunity, no doubt:--
     But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
       As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
     And after all poor Frederick may do better--
     Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'
     Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
       Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,
     After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
       Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;
     And when at last the pretty creature gets
       Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
     It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
     To find how very badly she selected.
     For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
       Worn out with importunity; or fall
     (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
       To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.
     A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure
       (If 't is not vain examples to recall)
     To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I
     See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.
     I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,
       'True, 't is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true'),
     Was chosen from out an amatory score,
       Albeit my years were less discreet than few;
     But though I also had reform'd before
       Those became one who soon were to be two,
     I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,
     That the young lady made a monstrous choice.
     O, pardon my digression--or at least
       Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end
     That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
       For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,
     A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
       My Muse by exhortation means to mend
     All people, at all times, and in most places,
     Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.
     But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
       I mean to show things really as they are,
     Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
       That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far
     From much improvement with that virtuous plough
       Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
     Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,
     Only to keep its corn at the old price.
     But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
       For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,
     Or like the old comparison of snows,
       Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.
     Like many people everybody knows,
       Don Juan was delighted to secure
     A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
     Who might not profit much by being at large.
     Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
       (I wish that others would find out the same);
     And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
       For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
     So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
       To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
     Consulting 'the Society for Vice
     Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.
     Olden she was--but had been very young;
       Virtuous she was--and had been, I believe;
     Although the world has such an evil tongue
       That--but my chaster ear will not receive
     An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
       In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,
     As that abominable tittle-tattle,
     Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.
     Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
       A slight observer in a modest way),
     And so may every one except a dunce,
       That ladies in their youth a little gay,
     Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
       Of the sad consequence of going astray,
     Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
     Which the mere passionless can never know.
     While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
       By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
     Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
       Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,--
     The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
       Entreating you to pause before you dash on;
     Expounding and illustrating the riddle
     Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.
     Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,
       As better knowing why they should be so,
     I think you 'll find from many a family picture,
       That daughters of such mothers as may know
     The world by experience rather than by lecture,
       Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show
     Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
     Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.
     I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about--
       As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
     But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
       She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
     And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
       Then she was given to charity and pity,
     And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
     For being a most exemplary wife.
     High in high circles, gentle in her own,
       She was the mild reprover of the young,
     Whenever--which means every day--they 'd shown
       An awkward inclination to go wrong.
     The quantity of good she did 's unknown,
       Or at the least would lengthen out my song:
     In brief, the little orphan of the East
     Had raised an interest in her, which increased.
     Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
       Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,
     A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;
       Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,
     And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
       Though this might ruin others, it did not him,
     At least entirely--for he had seen too many
     Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.
     And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
       For when they happen at a riper age,
     People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,
       And wonder Providence is not more sage.
     Adversity is the first path to truth:
       He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
     Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,
     Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.
     How far it profits is another matter.-
       Our hero gladly saw his little charge
     Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter
       Being long married, and thus set at large,
     Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
       To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
     To the next comer; or--as it will tell
     More Muse-like--like to Cytherea's shell.
     I call such things transmission; for there is
       A floating balance of accomplishment
     Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
       According as their minds or backs are bent.
     Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
       Of metaphysics; others are content
     With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
     While others have a genius turn'd for fits.
     But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,
       Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
     May be the baits for gentlemen or lords
       With regular descent, in these our days,
     The last year to the new transfers its hoards;
       New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
     Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches--
     All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.
     But now I will begin my poem. 'T is
       Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
     That from the first of Cantos up to this
       I 've not begun what we have to go through.
     These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
       Preludios, trying just a string or two
     Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;
     And when so, you shall have the overture.
     My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin
       About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:
     Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;
       'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.
     I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
       Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,
     If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,
     I think to canter gently through a hundred.
     Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
       Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,
     Although the highest: but as swords have hilts
       By which their power of mischief is increased,
     When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
       Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,
     Must still obey the high--which is their handle,
     Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.
     He had many friends who had many wives, and was
       Well look'd upon by both, to that extent
     Of friendship which you may accept or pass,
       It does nor good nor harm being merely meant
     To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
       And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:
     And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
     For the first season such a life scarce palls.
     A young unmarried man, with a good name
       And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
     For good society is but a game,
       'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
     Where every body has some separate aim,
       An end to answer, or a plan to lay--
     The single ladies wishing to be double,
     The married ones to save the virgins trouble.
     I don't mean this as general, but particular
       Examples may be found of such pursuits:
     Though several also keep their perpendicular
       Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
     Yet many have a method more reticular--
       'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:
     For talk six times with the same single lady,
     And you may get the wedding dresses ready.
     Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
       To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;
     Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,
       All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
     What 'your intentions are?'--One way or other
       It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
     And between pity for her case and yours,
     You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.
     I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
       And some of them high names: I have also known
     Young men who--though they hated to discuss
       Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown--
     Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,
       Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,
     And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
     In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.
     There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
       A peril--not indeed like love or marriage,
     But not the less for this to be depreciated:
       It is--I meant and mean not to disparage
     The show of virtue even in the vitiated--
       It adds an outward grace unto their carriage--
     But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,
     'Couleur de rose,' who 's neither white nor scarlet.
     Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'
       And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing
     On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow--
       Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.
     This works a world of sentimental woe,
       And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
     But yet is merely innocent flirtation,
     Not quite adultery, but adulteration.
     'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.
       The next of perils, though I place it sternest,
     Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'
       A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.
     Abroad, such things decide few women's fate--
       (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)--
     But in old England, when a young bride errs,
     Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.
     For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit
       Country, where a young couple of the same ages
     Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.
       Then there's the vulgar trick of those dd damages! !
     A verdict--grievous foe to those who cause it!-
       Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;
     Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
     And evidences which regale all readers.
     But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;
       A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
     Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,
       The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;
     You may see such at all the balls and dinners,
       Among the proudest of our aristocracy,
     So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste--
     And all by having tact as well as taste.
     Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
       Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;
     For he was sick--no, 't was not the word sick I meant--
       But he had seen so much love before,
     That he was not in heart so very weak;--I meant
       But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
     Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,
     Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.
     But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
       Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,
     And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
       Into a country where 't is half a fashion,
     Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,
       Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
     Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)
     At first he did not think the women pretty.
     I say at first--for he found out at last,
       But by degrees, that they were fairer far
     Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
       Beneath the influence of the eastern star.
     A further proof we should not judge in haste;
       Yet inexperience could not be his bar
     To taste:--the truth is, if men would confess,
     That novelties please less than they impress.
     Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to
       Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,
     To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,
       Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
     With such a chart as may be safely stuck to--
       For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'
     But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
     No doubt I should be told that black is fair.
     It is. I will not swear that black is white;
       But I suspect in fact that white is black,
     And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
       Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack
     Perhaps this new position--but I 'm right;
       Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:--
     He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
     Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.
     But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
       That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
     Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
       Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
     And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
       And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
     Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,
     Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.
     Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose
       Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--
     Not that there 's not a quantity of those
       Who have a due respect for their own wishes.
     Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows
       Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
     They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
     As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.
     But this has nought to do with their outsides.
       I said that Juan did not think them pretty
     At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides
       Half her attractions--probably from pity--
     And rather calmly into the heart glides,
       Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
     But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
     She keeps it for you like a true ally.
     She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
       Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,
     Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
       Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;
     Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb--
       le those bravuras (which I still am learning
     To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
     And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);--
     She cannot do these things, nor one or two
       Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
     Which takes so much--to give the devil his due;
       Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
     Nor settles all things in one interview
       (A thing approved as saving time and toil);--
     But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
     Well cultivated, it will render double.
     And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
       It is a very serious thing indeed:
     Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
       Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
     The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
       Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
     But the tenth instance will be a tornado,
     For there 's no saying what they will or may do.
     The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,
       They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
     And when the delicacies of the law
       Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
     Society, that china without flaw
       (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,
     To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:
     For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.
     Perhaps this is as it should be;--it is
       A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
     And be thy sins forgiven:'--but upon this
       I leave the saints to settle their own score.
     Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
       An erring woman finds an opener door
     For her return to Virtue--as they cal
     That lady, who should be at home to all.
     For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
       Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
     People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
       And care but for discoveries and not deeds.
     And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it
       By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,
     But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
     By rendering desperate those who had else repented.
     But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
       Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
     Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
       A lady altogether to his mind.
     A little 'blase'--'t is not to be wonder'd
       At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
     And though not vainer from his past success,
     No doubt his sensibilities were less.
     He also had been busy seeing sights--
       The Parliament and all the other houses;
     Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
       To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)
     The world to gaze upon those northern lights
       Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;
     He had also stood at times behind the throne--
     But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.
     He saw, however, at the closing session,
       That noble sight, when really free the nation,
     A king in constitutional possession
       Of such a throne as is the proudest station,
     Though despots know it not--till the progression
       Of freedom shall complete their education.
     'T is not mere splendour makes the show august
     To eye or heart--it is the people's trust.
     There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
       A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,
     With fascination in his very bow,
       And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
     Though royalty was written on his brow,
       He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
     Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,
     A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.
     And Juan was received, as hath been said,
       Into the best society: and there
     Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,
       However disciplined and debonnaire:--
     The talent and good humour he display'd,
       Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
     Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,
     Even though himself avoided the occasion.
     But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
       Is not to be put hastily together;
     And as my object is morality
       (Whatever people say), I don't know whether
     I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
       But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
     And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
     As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.
     Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
       Ends. When the body of the book 's begun,
     You 'll find it of a different construction
       From what some people say 't will be when done:
     The plan at present 's simply in concoction,
       I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
     That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
     Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.
     And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
       Remember, reader! you have had before
     The worst of tempests and the best of battles
       That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,
     Besides the most sublime of--Heaven knows what else:
       An usurer could scarce expect much more--
     But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
     Will turn upon 'political economy.'
     That is your present theme for popularity:
       Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
     It grows an act of patriotic charity,
       To show the people the best way to break.
     My plan (but I, if but for singularity,
       Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
     Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,
     And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.
[Illustration: Canto 13]
   I now mean to be serious;--it is time,
       Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.
     A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,
       And critically held as deleterious:
     Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
       Although when long a little apt to weary us;
     And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
     As an old temple dwindled to a column.
     The Lady Adeline Amundeville
       ('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found
     In pedigrees, by those who wander still
       Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
     Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,
       And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,
     In Britain--which of course true patriots find
     The goodliest soil of body and of mind.
     I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
       I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
     An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
       Is no great matter, so 't is in request,
     'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue--
       The kindest may be taken as a test.
     The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
     Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.
     And after that serene and somewhat dull
       Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days
     More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,
       We may presume to criticise or praise;
     Because indifference begins to lull
       Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;
     Also because the figure and the face
     Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.
     I know that some would fain postpone this era,
       Reluctant as all placemen to resign
     Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
       For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:
     But then they have their claret and Madeira
       To irrigate the dryness of decline;
     And county meetings, and the parliament,
     And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.
     And is there not religion, and reform,
       Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
     The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
       The landed and the monied speculation?
     The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
       Instead of love, that mere hallucination?
     Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
     Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
     Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,
       Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'-
     The only truth that yet has been confest
       Within these latest thousand years or later.
     Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:--
       For my part, I am but a mere spectator,
     And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
     Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;
     But neither love nor hate in much excess;
       Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
     It is because I cannot well do less,
       And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
     I should be very willing to redress
       Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,
     Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
     Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.
     Of all tales 't is the saddest--and more sad,
       Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,
     And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad
       His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
     His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
       But his adventures form a sorry sight;
     A sorrier still is the great moral taught
     By that real epic unto all who have thought.
     Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
       To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;
     Opposing singly the united strong,
       From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:--
     Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
       Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,
     A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
     And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?
     Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
       A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
     Of his own country;--seldom since that day
       Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
     The world gave ground before her bright array;
       And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
     That all their glory, as a composition,
     Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.
     I 'm 'at my old lunes'--digression, and forget
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
     The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
       Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
     But Destiny and Passion spread the net
       (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),
     And caught them;--what do they not catch, methinks?
     But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.
     I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare
       To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'
     And now I will proceed upon the pair.
       Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,
     Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;
       Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.
     The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,
     And since that time there has not been a second.
     Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,
       And wedded unto one she had loved well--
     A man known in the councils of the nation,
       Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,
     Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
       Proud of himself and her: the world could tell
     Nought against either, and both seem'd secure--
     She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.
     It chanced some diplomatical relations,
       Arising out of business, often brought
     Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
       Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught
     By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,
       And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
     And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends
     In making men what courtesy calls friends.
     And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
       Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow
     In judging men--when once his judgment was
       Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
     Had all the pertinacity pride has,
       Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,
     And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
     Because its own good pleasure hath decided.
     His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
       Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more
     His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
       And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.
     His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
       Of common likings, which make some deplore
     What they should laugh at--the mere ague still
     Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.
     ''T is not in mortals to command success:
       But do you more, Sempronius--don't deserve it,'
     And take my word, you won't have any less.
       Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
     Give gently way, when there 's too great a press;
       And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
     For, like a racer, or a boxer training,
     'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.
     Lord Henry also liked to be superior,
       As most men do, the little or the great;
     The very lowest find out an inferior,
       At least they think so, to exert their state
     Upon: for there are very few things wearier
       Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
     Which mortals generously would divide,
     By bidding others carry while they ride.
     In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,
       O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;
     In years he had the advantage of time's sequel;
       And, as he thought, in country much the same--
     Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,
       At which all modern nations vainly aim;
     And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
     So that few members kept the house up later.
     These were advantages: and then he thought--
       It was his foible, but by no means sinister--
     That few or none more than himself had caught
       Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
     He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
       And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
     And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
     Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.
     He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
       He almost honour'd him for his docility;
     Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
       Or contradicted but with proud humility.
     He knew the world, and would not see depravity
       In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,
     If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop--
     For then they are very difficult to stop.
     And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
       Constantinople, and such distant places;
     Where people always did as they were bid,
       Or did what they should not with foreign graces.
     Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid
       Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;
     And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
     Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.
     And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
       And diplomatic dinners, or at other--
     For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,
       As in freemasonry a higher brother.
     Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;
       His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
     And all men like to show their hospitality
     To him whose breeding matches with his quality.
     At Blank-Blank Square;--for we will break no squares
       By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
     And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,
       Reaping allusions private and inglorious,
     Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,
       Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,
     That therefore do I previously declare,
     Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.
     Also there bin another pious reason
       For making squares and streets anonymous;
     Which is, that there is scarce a single season
       Which doth not shake some very splendid house
     With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--
       A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:
     Such I might stumble over unawares,
     Unless I knew the very chastest squares.
     'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,
       A place where peccadillos are unknown;
     But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
       For letting that pure sanctuary alone.
     Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
       Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,
     A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:
       Such arebut I have lost the London Chart.
     At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,
       Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,
     As many other noble scions were;
       And some who had but talent for their crest;
     Or wealth, which is a passport every where;
       Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best
     Recommendation; and to be well drest
     Will very often supersede the rest.
     And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
       Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,
     Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;--
       Indeed we see the daily proof display'd
     In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,
       Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
     Which is the only cause that we can guess
     Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;--
     But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
       'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex
     A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
       Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex--
     Variety itself will more encumber.
       'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;
     And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
     Self-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.
     But Adeline had not the least occasion
       For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
     To virtue proper, or good education.
       Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
     Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
       And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
     Secure of admiration, its impression
     Was faint, as of an every-day possession.
     To all she was polite without parade;
       To some she show'd attention of that kind
     Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
       In such a sort as cannot leave behind
     A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--
       A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,
     To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,
     Just to console sad glory for being glorious;
     Which is in all respects, save now and then,
       A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
     Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men
       Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
     The praise of persecution; gaze again
       On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze
     Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
     What can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud.
     There also was of course in Adeline
       That calm patrician polish in the address,
     Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
       Of any thing which nature would express;
     Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,--
       At least his manner suffers not to guess
     That any thing he views can greatly please.
     Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese--
     Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'
       Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'
     An art on which the artists greatly vary,
       And have not yet attain'd to much success.
     However, 't is expedient to be wary:
       Indifference certes don't produce distress;
     And rash enthusiasm in good society
     Were nothing but a moral inebriety.
     But Adeline was not indifferent: for
       (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,
     As a volcano holds the lava more
       Within--et caetera. Shall I go on?--No!
     I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
       So let the often-used volcano go.
     Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,
     It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!
     I 'll have another figure in a trice:--
       What say you to a bottle of champagne?
     Frozen into a very vinous ice,
       Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
     Yet in the very centre, past all price,
       About a liquid glassful will remain;
     And this is stronger than the strongest grape
     Could e'er express in its expanded shape:
     'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
       And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
     A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
       And such are many--though I only meant her
     From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
       On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
     And your cold people are beyond all price,
     When once you have broken their confounded ice.
     But after all they are a North-West Passage
       Unto the glowing India of the soul;
     And as the good ships sent upon that message
       Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
     (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),
       Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;
     For if the Pole 's not open, but all frost
     (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.
     And young beginners may as well commence
       With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;
     While those who are not beginners should have sense
       Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon
     With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
       The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
     Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out
     Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.
     But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
       Is sometimes truculent--but never mind:
     The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
       (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
     And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
       Of the two principles, but leaves behind
     As many doubts as any other doctrine
     Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.
     The English winter--ending in July,
       To recommence in August--now was done.
     'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
       On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
     But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
       Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,
     Always premising that said son at college
     Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.
     The London winter 's ended in July--
       Sometimes a little later. I don't err
     In this: whatever other blunders lie
       Upon my shoulders, here I must aver
     My Muse a glass of weatherology;
       For parliament is our barometer:
     Let radicals its other acts attack,
     Its sessions form our only almanack.
     When its quicksilver 's down at zero,--lo
       Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!
     Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,
       And happiest they who horses can engage;
     The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
       Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
     And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
     Sigh--as the postboys fasten on the traces.
     They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
       To the Greek kalends of another session.
     Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
       What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,
     Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,
       At a long date--till they can get a fresh one--
     Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
     Also the solace of an overcharge.
     But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
       Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
     Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,
       And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
     The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
       The postboys have no reason to disparage
     Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
     The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.
     'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey--
       That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;
     Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,
       Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen
     Can paint,--'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'
       (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,
     If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
     Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)
     The London winter and the country summer
       Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
     When nature wears the gown that doth become her,
       To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
     And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
       Listening debates not very wise or witty,
     Ere patriots their true country can remember;--
     But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.
     I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
       The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
     Were vanish'd to be what they call alone--
       That is, with thirty servants for parade,
     As many guests, or more; before whom groan
       As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
     Let none accuse Old England's hospitality--
     Its quantity is but condensed to quality.
     Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline
       Departed like the rest of their compeers,
     The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
       The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
     None than themselves could boast a longer line,
       Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;
     And oaks as olden as their pedigree
     Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.
     A paragraph in every paper told
       Of their departure: such is modern fame:
     'T is pity that it takes no farther hold
       Than an advertisement, or much the same;
     When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.
       The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim--
     'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
     Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.
     'We understand the splendid host intends
       To entertain, this autumn, a select
     And numerous party of his noble friends;
       'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,
       With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;
     Also a foreigner of high condition,
     The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'
     And thus we see--who doubts the Morning Post?
       (Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'
     Which those most swear to who believe them most)--
       Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,
     Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,
       With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'
     'T is odd, but true,--last war the News abounded
     More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;--
     As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;
       Present, Lords A. B. C.'--Earls, dukes, by name
     Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:
       Then underneath, and in the very same
     Column; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here
       The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,
     Whose loss in the late action we regret:
     The vacancies are fill'd up--see Gazette.'
     To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,--
       An old, old monastery once, and now
     Still older mansion; of a rich and rare
       Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow
     Few specimens yet left us can compare
       Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,
     Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,
     To shelter their devotion from the wind.
     It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
       Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak
     Stood like Caractacus in act to rally
       His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
     And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
       The dappled foresters--as day awoke,
     The branching stag swept down with all his herd,
     To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.
     Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,
       Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
     By a river, which its soften'd way did take
       In currents through the calmer water spread
     Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
       And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
     The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
     With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.
     Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,
       Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,
     Its shriller echoes--like an infant made
       Quiet--sank into softer ripples, gliding
     Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,
       Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding
     Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
     According as the skies their shadows threw.
     A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
       (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart
     In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.
       These last had disappear'd--a loss to art:
     The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,
       And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
     Which mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,
     In gazing on that venerable arch.
     Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
       Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;
     But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
       But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
     When each house was a fortalice, as tell
       The annals of full many a line undone,--
     The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain
     For those who knew not to resign or reign.
     But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
       The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,
     With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,
       Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;
     She made the earth below seem holy ground.
       This may be superstition, weak or wild,
     But even the faintest relics of a shrine
     Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.
     A mighty window, hollow in the centre,
       Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
     Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,
       Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,
     Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,
       The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings
     The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire
     Lie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.
     But in the noontide of the moon, and when
       The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
     There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
       Is musical--a dying accent driven
     Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.
       Some deem it but the distant echo given
     Back to the night wind by the waterfall,
     And harmonised by the old choral wall:
     Others, that some original shape, or form
       Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power
     (Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm
       In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)
     To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
       Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
     The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
     The fact:--I 've heard it--once perhaps too much.
     Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,
       Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint--
     Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
       And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
     The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
       And sparkled into basins, where it spent
     Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
     Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.
     The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
       With more of the monastic than has been
     Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,
       The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:
     An exquisite small chapel had been able,
       Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;
     The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,
     And spoke more of the baron than the monk.
     Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd
       By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
     Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,
       Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,
     Yet left a grand impression on the mind,
       At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
     We gaze upon a giant for his stature,
     Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.
     Steel barons, molten the next generation
       To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,
     Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;
       And Lady Marys blooming into girls,
     With fair long locks, had also kept their station;
       And countesses mature in robes and pearls:
     Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,
     Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.
     Judges in very formidable ermine
       Were there, with brows that did not much invite
     The accused to think their lordships would determine
       His cause by leaning much from might to right:
     Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
       Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
     As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
     Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'
     Generals, some all in armour, of the old
       And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
     Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,
       Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:
     Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:
       Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;
     And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
     Who could not get the place for which he sued.
     But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
       Fatigued with these hereditary glories,
     There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
       Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;
     Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
       In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
     Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
     His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.
     Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
       There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
     Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain
       Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--
     But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,
       Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:
     His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish
     Or Dutch with thirst--What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.
     O reader! if that thou canst read,--and know,
       'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
     To constitute a reader; there must go
       Virtues of which both you and I have need;--
     Firstly, begin with the beginning (though
       That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;
     Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning
     In this sort, end at least with the beginning.
     But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,
       While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
     Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
       Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
     That poets were so from their earliest date,
       By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;
     But a mere modern must be moderate--
     I spare you then the furniture and plate.
     The mellow autumn came, and with it came
       The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
     The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
       The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
     In russet jacket:--lynx-like is his aim;
       Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.
     Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
     And ah, ye poachers!--'T is no sport for peasants.
     An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
       Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
     The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
       The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
     Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
       The claret light, and the Madeira strong.
     If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
     The very best of vineyards is the cellar.
     Then, if she hath not that serene decline
       Which makes the southern autumn's day appear
     As if 't would to a second spring resign
       The season, rather than to winter drear,
     Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,--
       The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
     Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
     As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.
     And for the effeminate villeggiatura--
       Rife with more horns than hounds--she hath the chase,
     So animated that it might allure
       Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;
     Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,
       And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
     If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame
     Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.
     The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,
       Consisted of--we give the sex the pas--
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;
       The Ladies Scilly, Busey;--Miss Eclat,
     Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,
       And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;
     Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,
     Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:
     With other Countesses of Blank--but rank;
       At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;
     Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,
       All purged and pious from their native clouds;
     Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:
       No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
     The 'passee' and the past; for good society
     Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,--
     That is, up to a certain point; which point
       Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
     Appearances appear to form the joint
       On which it hinges in a higher station;
     And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
       Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;
     Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)
     'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'
     I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
       Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.
     I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
       By the mere combination of a coterie;
     Also a so-so matron boldly fight
       Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
     And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
     Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.
     I have seen more than I 'll say:--but we will see
       How our villeggiatura will get on.
     The party might consist of thirty-three
       Of highest caste--the Brahmins of the ton.
     I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
       But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
     By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,
     There also were some Irish absentees.
     There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
       Who limits all his battles to the bar
     And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,
       He shows more appetite for words than war.
     There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
       Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.
     There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
     And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.
     There was the Duke of Dash, who was a--duke,
       'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers
     Like Charlemagne's--and all such peers in look
       And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears
     For commoners had ever them mistook.
       There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!
     All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set
     Less on a convent than a coronet.
     There were four Honourable Misters, whose
       Honour was more before their names than after;
     There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
       Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,
     Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;
       But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
     Because--such was his magic power to please--
     The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.
     There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
       Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;
     Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;
       Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.
     There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
       Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;
     And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,
     Good at all things, but better at a bet.
     There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
       And General Fireface, famous in the field,
     A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
       Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.
     There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
       In his grave office so completely skill'd,
     That when a culprit came far condemnation,
     He had his judge's joke for consolation.
     Good company 's a chess-board--there are kings,
       Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;
     Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,
       Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.
     My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,
       Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,
     Alighting rarely:--were she but a hornet,
     Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.
     I had forgotten--but must not forget--
       An orator, the latest of the session,
     Who had deliver'd well a very set
       Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression
     Upon debate: the papers echoed yet
       With his debut, which made a strong impression,
     And rank'd with what is every day display'd--
     'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'
     Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote
       And lost virginity of oratory,
     Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),
       He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
     With memory excellent to get by rote,
       With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,
     Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,
     'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.
     There also were two wits by acclamation,
       Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,
     Both lawyers and both men of education;
       But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
     Longbow was rich in an imagination
       As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
     But sometimes stumbling over a potato,--
     While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.
     Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
       But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
     With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,
       And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
     Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
       At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
     Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--
     This by his heart, his rival by his head.
     If all these seem a heterogeneous mas
       To be assembled at a country seat,
     Yet think, a specimen of every class
       Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.
     The days of Comedy are gone, alas!
       When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:
     Society is smooth'd to that excess,
     That manners hardly differ more than dress.
     Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground--
       Ridiculous enough, but also dull;
     Professions, too, are no more to be found
       Professional; and there is nought to cull
     Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
       They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
     Society is now one polish'd horde,
     Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.
     But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
       The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;
     And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
       You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.
     Farther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening
       Forbids. Its great impression in my youth
     Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,
     'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'
     But what we can we glean in this vile age
       Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
     I must not quite omit the talking sage,
       Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,
     Who, in his common-place book, had a page
       Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-
     'Alas, poor ghost!'--What unexpected woes
     Await those who have studied their bon-mots!
     Firstly, they must allure the conversation
       By many windings to their clever clinch;
     And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
       Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,
     But take an ell--and make a great sensation,
       If possible; and thirdly, never flinch
     When some smart talker puts them to the test,
     But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.
     Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
       The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
     Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
       To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
     I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
       Albeit all human history attests
     That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!-
     Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.
     Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'
       Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
     To this we have added since, the love of money,
       The only sort of pleasure which requites.
     Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
       We tire of mistresses and parasites;
     But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
     When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!
     The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
       Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport--
     The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
       The middle-aged to make the day more short;
     For ennui is a growth of English root,
       Though nameless in our language:--we retort
     The fact for words, and let the French translate
     That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.
     The elderly walk'd through the library,
       And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
     Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,
       And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
     Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
       Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
     Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,
     Longing at sixty for the hour of six.
     But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
       Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were
     Masters of their own time--or in communion,
       Or solitary, as they chose to bear
     The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
       Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
     What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
     When, where, and how he chose for that repast.
     The ladies--some rouged, some a little pale--
       Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
     Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
       Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
     Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
       And settled bonnets by the newest code,
     Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,
     To make each correspondent a new debtor.
     For some had absent lovers, all had friends.
       The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
     And hardly heaven--because it never ends.
       I love the mystery of a female missal,
     Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,
       But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
     When he allured poor Dolon:--you had better
     Take care what you reply to such a letter.
     Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;--
       Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;--
     Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
       And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:
     And angling, too, that solitary vice,
       Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;
     The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet
     Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.
     With evening came the banquet and the wine;
       The conversazione; the duet,
     Attuned by voices more or less divine
       (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).
     The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;
       But the two youngest loved more to be set
     Down to the harp--because to music's charms
     They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.
     Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
       For then the gentlemen were rather tired)
     Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;
       Then there was small-talk ready when required;
     Flirtation--but decorous; the mere praise
       Of charms that should or should not be admired.
     The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
     And then retreated soberly--at ten.
     The politicians, in a nook apart,
       Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
     The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
       To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;
     Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
       A moment's good thing may have cost them years
     Before they find an hour to introduce it;
     And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.
     But all was gentle and aristocratic
       In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,
     As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
       There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
     And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
       But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
     We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,
     But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.
     They separated at an early hour;
       That is, ere midnight--which is London's noon:
     But in the country ladies seek their bower
       A little earlier than the waning moon.
     Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower--
       May the rose call back its true colour soon!
     Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,
     And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.
[Illustration: Canto 14]
   If from great nature's or our own abyss
       Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,
     Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss--
       But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.
     One system eats another up, and this
       Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;
     For when his pious consort gave him stones
     In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.
     But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
       And eats her parents, albeit the digestion
     Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,
       After due search, your faith to any question?
     Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast
       You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.
     Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;
     And yet what are your other evidences?
     For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,
       Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
     Except perhaps that you were born to die?
       And both may after all turn out untrue.
     An age may come, Font of Eternity,
       When nothing shall be either old or new.
     Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,
     And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.
     A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
       Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
     How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
       The very Suicide that pays his debt
     At once without instalments (an old way
       Of paying debts, which creditors regret)
     Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,
     Less from disgust of life than dread of death.
     'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;
       And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
     Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare
       The worst to know it:--when the mountains rear
     Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
       You look down o'er the precipice, and drear
     The gulf of rock yawns,--you can't gaze a minute
     Without an awful wish to plunge within it.
     'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,
       Retire: but look into your past impression!
     And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
       Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
     The lurking bias, be it truth or error,
       To the unknown; a secret prepossession,
     To plunge with all your fears--but where? You know not,
     And that's the reason why you do--or do not.
     But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.
       Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,
     For which my sole excuse is--'t is my way;
       Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion
     I write what 's uppermost, without delay:
       This narrative is not meant for narration,
     But a mere airy and fantastic basis,
     To build up common things with common places.
     You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,
       'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'
     And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
       Is poesy, according as the mind glows;
     A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,
       A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:
     And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
     But just to play with, as an infant plays.
     The world is all before me--or behind;
       For I have seen a portion of that same,
     And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--
       Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
     To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,
       Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;
     For I was rather famous in my time,
     Until I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.
     I have brought this world about my ears, and eke
       The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who
     Upon my head have bid their thunders break
       In pious libels by no means a few.
     And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
       Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.
     In youth I wrote because my mind was full,
     And now because I feel it growing dull.
     But 'why then publish?'--There are no rewards
       Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.
     I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?
       Why drink? Why read?--To make some hour less dreary.
     It occupies me to turn back regards
       On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;
     And what I write I cast upon the stream,
     To swim or sink--I have had at least my dream.
     I think that were I certain of success,
       I hardly could compose another line:
     So long I 've battled either more or less,
       That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.
     This feeling 't is not easy to express,
       And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
     In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing--
     The one is winning, and the other losing.
     Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
       She gathers a repertory of facts,
     Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,
       But mostly sings of human things and acts--
     And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
       For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;
     And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
     With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.
     Love, war, a tempest--surely there 's variety;
       Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
     A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
       A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
     If you have nought else, here 's at least satiety
       Both in performance and in preparation;
     And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
     Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.
     The portion of this world which I at present
       Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
     Is one of which there 's no description recent.
       The reason why is easy to determine:
     Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,
       There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
     A dull and family likeness through all ages,
     Of no great promise for poetic pages.
     With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;
       Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;
     A sort of varnish over every fault;
       A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
     Factitious passions, wit without much salt,
       A want of that true nature which sublimes
     Whate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony
     Of character, in those at least who have got any.
     Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
       They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
     But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
       And they must be or seem what they were: still
     Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;
       But when of the first sight you have had your fill,
     It palls--at least it did so upon me,
     This paradise of pleasure and ennui.
     When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,
       Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;
     With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;
       Seen beauties brought to market by the score,
     Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;
       There 's little left but to be bored or bore.
     Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem
     The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.
     'T is said--indeed a general complaint--
       That no one has succeeded in describing
     The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:
       Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing
     The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,
       To furnish matter for their moral gibing;
     And that their books have but one style in common--
     My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.
     But this can't well be true, just now; for writers
       Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:
     I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
       Especially when young, for that 's essential.
     Why do their sketches fail them as inditers
       Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
     The real portrait of the highest tribe?
     'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.
     'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum
       Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.
     Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,
       A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
     Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
       For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
     'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit--'
     Which means that vulgar people must not share it.
     And therefore what I throw off is ideal--
       Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;
     Which bears the same relation to the real,
       As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.
     The grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;
       My music has some mystic diapasons;
     And there is much which could not be appreciated
     In any manner by the uninitiated.
     Alas! worlds fall--and woman, since she fell'd
       The world (as, since that history less polite
     Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)
       Has not yet given up the practice quite.
     Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,
       Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,
     Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins
     Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,--
     A daily plague, which in the aggregate
       May average on the whole with parturition.
     But as to women, who can penetrate
       The real sufferings of their she condition?
     Man's very sympathy with their estate
       Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
     Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
     But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.
     All this were very well, and can't be better;
       But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,
     So many troubles from her birth beset her,
       Such small distinction between friends and foes,
     The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
       That--but ask any woman if she'd choose
     (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
     Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?
     'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,
       Which even those who obey would fain be thought
     To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
       But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,
     By various joltings of life's hackney coach,
       I for one venerate a petticoat--
     A garment of a mystical sublimity,
     No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.
     Much I respect, and much I have adored,
       In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,
     Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
       And more attracts by all it doth conceal--
     A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
       A loving letter with a mystic seal,
     A cure for grief--for what can ever rankle
     Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?
     And when upon a silent, sullen day,
       With a sirocco, for example, blowing,
     When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,
       And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
     And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
       The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,--
     'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,
     To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.
     We left our heroes and our heroines
       In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,
     Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,
       Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,
     Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,
       Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,
     Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun--
     Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.
     An in-door life is less poetical;
       And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
     With which I could not brew a pastoral.
       But be it as it may, a bard must meet
     All difficulties, whether great or small,
       To spoil his undertaking or complete,
     And work away like spirit upon matter,
     Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.
     Juan--in this respect, at least, like saints--
       Was all things unto people of all sorts,
     And lived contentedly, without complaints,
       In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts--
     Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
       And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
     He likewise could be most things to all women,
     Without the coxcombry of certain she men.
     A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
       'T is also subject to the double danger
     Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
       Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
     But Juan had been early taught to range
       The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
     So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
     Knew that he had a rider on his back.
     And now in this new field, with some applause,
       He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
     And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'
       And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
     He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
       Of hunting--for the sagest youth is frail;
     Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,
     And once o'er several country gentlemen.
     But on the whole, to general admiration
       He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
     Marvell'd at merit of another nation;
       The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'--Sires,
     The Nestors of the sporting generation,
       Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;
     The huntsman's self relented to a grin,
     And rated him almost a whipper-in.
     Such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,
       But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
     Yet I must own,--although in this I yield
       To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,--
     He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
       Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,
     And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
     Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'
     He also had a quality uncommon
       To early risers after a long chase,
     Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon
       December's drowsy day to his dull race,--
     A quality agreeable to woman,
       When her soft, liquid words run on apace,
     Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,--
     He did not fall asleep just after dinner;
     But, light and airy, stood on the alert,
       And shone in the best part of dialogue,
     By humouring always what they might assert,
       And listening to the topics most in vogue;
     Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;
       And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!
     He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--
     In short, there never was a better hearer.
     And then he danced;--all foreigners excel
       The serious Angles in the eloquence
     Of pantomime;--he danced, I say, right well,
       With emphasis, and also with good sense--
     A thing in footing indispensable;
       He danced without theatrical pretence,
     Not like a ballet-master in the van
     Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.
     Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,
       And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
     Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,
       And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
     And then he had an ear for music's sound,
       Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.
     Such classic pas--sans flaws--set off our hero,
     He glanced like a personified Bolero;
     Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,
       In Guido's famous fresco which alone
     Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a
       Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.
     The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a
       Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,
     And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour
     Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.
     No marvel then he was a favourite;
       A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;
     A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
       At least he kept his vanity retired.
     Such was his tact, he could alike delight
       The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
     Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'
     She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
       Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
     For several winters in the grand, grand monde.
       I 'd rather not say what might be related
     Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
       Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
     Her late performance had been a dead set
     At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     This noble personage began to look
       A little black upon this new flirtation;
     But such small licences must lovers brook,
       Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
     Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
       'T will but precipitate a situation
     Extremely disagreeable, but common
     To calculators when they count on woman.
     The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;
       The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;
     Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;
       Some would not deem such women could be found;
     Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
       Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;
     And several pitied with sincere regret
     Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     But what is odd, none ever named the duke,
       Who, one might think, was something in the affair;
     True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took
       But small concern about the when, or where,
     Or what his consort did: if he could brook
       Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
     Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
     Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.
     But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
       Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,
     My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,
       Began to think the duchess' conduct free;
     Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,
       And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
     Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
     For which most friends reserve their sensibility.
     There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
       'T is so becoming to the soul and face,
     Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
       And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
     Without a friend, what were humanity,
       To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
     Consoling us with--'Would you had thought twice!
     Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'
     O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,
       Especially when we are ill at ease;
     They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
       Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
     Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,
       As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
     When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
     Go to the coffee-house, and take another.
     But this is not my maxim: had it been,
       Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not--
     I would not be a tortoise in his screen
       Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.
     'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
       That which humanity may bear, or bear not:
     'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,
     And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.
     Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,
       Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,
     Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'
       Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,
     Who, 'stead of saying what you now should do,
       Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,
     And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'
     With a long memorandum of old stories.
     The Lady Adeline's serene severity
       Was not confined to feeling for her friend,
     Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,
       Unless her habits should begin to mend:
     But Juan also shared in her austerity,
       But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:
     His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
     And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.
     These forty days' advantage of her years--
       And hers were those which can face calculation,
     Boldly referring to the list of peers
       And noble births, nor dread the enumeration--
     Gave her a right to have maternal fears
       For a young gentleman's fit education,
     Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
     In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.
     This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty--
       Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew
     The strictest in chronology and virtue
       Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
     O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
       With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.
     Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,
     If but to keep thy credit as a mower.
     But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
       Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:
     'T was rather her experience made her sage,
       For she had seen the world and stood its test,
     As I have said in--I forget what page;
       My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd
     By this time;--but strike six from seven-and-twenty,
     And you will find her sum of years in plenty.
     At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
       She put all coronets into commotion:
     At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted
       With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:
     At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
       A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
     She had consented to create again
     That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'
     Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,
       Admired, adored; but also so correct,
     That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,
       Without the apparel of being circumspect:
     They could not even glean the slightest splinters
       From off the marble, which had no defect.
     She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage
     To bear a son and heir--and one miscarriage.
     Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,
       Those little glitterers of the London night;
     But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her--
       She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
     Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;
       But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
     And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
     A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?
     I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
       Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
     Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
       Especially with politics on hand;
     I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
       Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
     I hate it, as I hate an argument,
     A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'
     'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
       They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
     So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
       I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
     To trace all actions to their secret springs
       Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;
     But this is not at present my concern,
     And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.
     With the kind view of saving an eclat,
       Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
     The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
       That Juan was unlikely to resist
     (For foreigners don't know that a faux pas
       In England ranks quite on a different list
     From those of other lands unblest with juries,
     Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);--
     The Lady Adeline resolved to take
       Such measures as she thought might best impede
     The farther progress of this sad mistake.
       She thought with some simplicity indeed;
     But innocence is bold even at the stake,
       And simple in the world, and doth not need
     Nor use those palisades by dames erected,
     Whose virtue lies in never being detected.
     It was not that she fear'd the very worst:
       His Grace was an enduring, married man,
     And was not likely all at once to burst
       Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan
     Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first
       The magic of her Grace's talisman,
     And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)
     With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
       And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;
     One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt
       A lover with caprices soft and dear,
     That like to make a quarrel, when they can't
       Find one, each day of the delightful year;
     Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
     And--what is worst of all--won't let you go:
     The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
       Or make a Werter of him in the end.
     No wonder then a purer soul should dread
       This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
     It were much better to be wed or dead,
       Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.
     'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
     If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'
     And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
       Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
     She call'd her husband now and then apart,
       And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile
     Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art
       To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;
     And answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,
     In such guise that she could make nothing of it.
     Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered
       In any body's business but the king's:'
     Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,
       Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'
     Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
       And was not to be held in leading strings;'
     And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
     'That good but rarely came from good advice.'
     And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth
       Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
     To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth--
       At least as far as bienseance allows:
     That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
       That young men rarely made monastic vows;
     That opposition only more attaches--
     But here a messenger brought in despatches:
     And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'
       Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,
     To furnish matter for some future Livy
       To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;
     And if their full contents I do not give ye,
       It is because I do not know them yet;
     But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
     To come between mine epic and its index.
     But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
       Another gentle common-place or two,
     Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,
       And pass, for want of better, though not new:
     Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
       And having casually glanced it through,
     Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,
     Less like a young wife than an aged sister.
     He was a cold, good, honourable man,
       Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;
     A goodly spirit for a state divan,
       A figure fit to walk before a king;
     Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van
       On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
     The very model of a chamberlain--
     And such I mean to make him when I reign.
     But there was something wanting on the whole--
       I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--
     Which pretty women--the sweet souls!--call soul.
       Certes it was not body; he was well
     Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,
       A handsome man, that human miracle;
     And in each circumstance of love or war
     Had still preserved his perpendicular.
     Still there was something wanting, as I 've said--
       That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'
     Which, for what I know, may of yore have led
       To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy
     The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
       Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy
     Was much inferior to King Menelaus:--
     But thus it is some women will betray us.
     There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
       Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved
     By turns the difference of the several sexes;
       Neither can show quite how they would be loved.
     The sensual for a short time but connects us,
       The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
     But both together form a kind of centaur,
     Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.
     A something all-sufficient for the heart
       Is that for which the sex are always seeking:
     But how to fill up that same vacant part?
       There lies the rub--and this they are but weak in.
     Frail mariners afloat without a chart,
       They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
     And when they have made the shore through every shock,
     'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.
     There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'
       For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;--
     I will not make his great description less,
       And beg his British godship's humble pardon,
     If in my extremity of rhyme's distress,
       I touch a single leaf where he is warden;--
     But though the flower is different, with the French
     Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'
     Eureka! I have found it! What I mean
       To say is, not that love is idleness,
     But that in love such idleness has been
       An accessory, as I have cause to guess.
     Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;
       Your men of business are not apt to express
     Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,
     Convey'd Medea as her supercargo.
     'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'
       Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;
     His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
       Is much more to the purpose of his song;
     Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
       Unless good company be kept too long;
     But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
     Thrice happy they who have an occupation!
     Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
       Eve made up millinery with fig leaves--
     The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
       As far as I know, that the church receives:
     And since that time it need not cost much showing,
       That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
     And still more women, spring from not employing
     Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.
     And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
       A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
     A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
       Bards may sing what they please about Content;
     Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;
       And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
     Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
     Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.
     I do declare, upon an affidavit,
       Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
     Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,
       Would some believe that such a tale had been:
     But such intent I never had, nor have it;
       Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
     Especially when they would look like lies;
     I therefore deal in generalities.
     'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'--and why?
       Because he mopeth idly in his shell,
     And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
       Much as a monk may do within his cell:
     And a-propos of monks, their piety
       With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;
     Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
     Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.
     O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,
       Whose merit none enough can sing or say,
     Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,
       Thou moral Washington of Africa!
     But there 's another little thing, I own,
       Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,
     And set the other halt of earth to rights;
     You have freed the blacks--now pray shut up the whites.
     Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
       Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
     Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'
       And ask them how they like to be in thrall?
     Shut up each high heroic salamander,
       Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);
     Shut up--no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
     Or else 't will cost us all another million.
     Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
       And you will be perhaps surprised to find
     All things pursue exactly the same route,
       As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
     This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
       Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
     But till that point d'appui is found, alas!
     Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.
     Our gentle Adeline had one defect--
       Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
     Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
       As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
     A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,
       Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
     But when the latter works its own undoing,
     Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.
     She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
       Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
     The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
       Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
     She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
       No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
     Their union was a model to behold,
     Serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold.
     There was no great disparity of years,
       Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
     They moved like stars united in their spheres,
       Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,
     Where mingled and yet separate appears
       The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
     Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
     Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.
     Now when she once had ta'en an interest
       In any thing, however she might flatter
     Herself that her intentions were the best,
       Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
     Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,
       And gather'd as they run like growing water
     Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast
     Was not at first too readily impress'd.
     But when it was, she had that lurking demon
       Of double nature, and thus doubly named--
     Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,
       That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
     As obstinacy, both in men and women,
       Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:--
     And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
     To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.
     Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,
       It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:
     Must the event decide between the two?
       I leave it to your people of sagacity
     To draw the line between the false and true,
       If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:
     My business is with Lady Adeline,
     Who in her way too was a heroine.
     She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
       I think not she was then in love with Juan:
     If so, she would have had the strength to fly
       The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
     She merely felt a common sympathy
       (I will not say it was a false or true one)
     In him, because she thought he was in danger,--
     Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,
     She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this
       Without the farce of friendship, or romance
     Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
       Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,
     Or Germany, where people purely kiss.
       To thus much Adeline would not advance;
     But of such friendship as man's may to man be
     She was as capable as woman can be.
     No doubt the secret influence of the sex
       Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
     An innocent predominance annex,
       And tune the concord to a finer mood.
     If free from passion, which all friendship checks,
       And your true feelings fully understood,
     No friend like to a woman earth discovers,
     So that you have not been nor will be lovers.
     Love bears within its breast the very germ
       Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
     That violent things more quickly find a term
       Is shown through nature's whole analogies;
     And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
       Would you have endless lightning in the skies?
     Methinks Love's very title says enough:
     How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?
     Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
       (I merely quote what I have heard from many)
     Had lovers not some reason to regret
       The passion which made Solomon a zany.
     I 've also seen some wives (not to forget
       The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
     Who were the very paragons of wives,
     Yet made the misery of at least two lives.
     I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
       But true--as, if expedient, I could prove)
     That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
       At home, far more than ever yet was Love--
     Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
       Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;
     Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
     Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.
     Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
       Grew friends in this or any other sense,
     Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:
       At present I am glad of a pretence
     To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
       And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
     The surest way for ladies and for books
     To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.
     Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish
       To read Don Quixote in the original,
     A pleasure before which all others vanish;
       Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
     Or serious, are the topics I must banish
       To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
     Say something to the purpose, and display
     Considerable talent in my way.
     Above all, I beg all men to forbear
       Anticipating aught about the matter:
     They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
       And Juan too, especially the latter.
     And I shall take a much more serious air
       Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
     It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
     Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.
     But great things spring from little:--Would you think,
       That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
     As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
       Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
     As few would ever dream could form the link
       Of such a sentimental situation?
     You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards--
     It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.
     'T is strange,--but true; for truth is always strange;
       Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
     How much would novels gain by the exchange!
       How differently the world would men behold!
     How oft would vice and virtue places change!
       The new world would be nothing to the old,
     If some Columbus of the moral seas
     Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.
     What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then
       Would be discover'd in the human soul!
     What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,
       With self-love in the centre as their pole!
     What Anthropophagi are nine of ten
       Of those who hold the kingdoms in control
     Were things but only call'd by their right name,
     Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.
   Ah!--What should follow slips from my reflection;
       Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
     As _à propos_ of hope or retrospection,
       As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
     All present life is but an interjection,
       An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
     Or a 'Ha! ha!' or 'Bah!'--a yawn, or 'Pooh!'
     Of which perhaps the latter is most true.
     But, more or less, the whole 's a syncope
       Or a singultus--emblems of emotion,
     The grand antithesis to great ennui,
       Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,--
     That watery outline of eternity,
       Or miniature at least, as is my notion,
     Which ministers unto the soul's delight,
     In seeing matters which are out of sight.
     But all are better than the sigh supprest,
       Corroding in the cavern of the heart,
     Making the countenance a masque of rest,
       And turning human nature to an art.
     Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
       Dissimulation always sets apart
     A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
     Is that which passes with least contradiction.
     Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not
       Remember, without telling, passion's errors?
     The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,
       Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:
     What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,
       He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;
     The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
     Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.
     And as for love--O love!--We will proceed.
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
     A pretty name as one would wish to read,
       Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
     There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
       There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
     There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
     Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.
     The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
       And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
     For few of the soft sex are very stable
       In their resolves--alas! that I should say so!
     They differ as wine differs from its label,
       When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,
     But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
     Till old, may undergo adulteration.
     But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
       The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
     Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
       Or glorious as a diamond richly set;
     A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
       And for which Nature might forego her debt--
     Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't
     The luck of finding every body solvent.
     O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily
       Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
     Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
       Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
     But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
       Advances with exasperated rap,
     And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
     On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'
     Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!
       She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
     What though she now and then may slip from duty,
       The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
     Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
       You should be civil in a modest way:
     Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
     And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.
     Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
       Where she was interested (as was said),
     Because she was not apt, like some of us,
       To like too readily, or too high bred
     To show it (points we need not now discuss)--
       Would give up artlessly both heart and head
     Unto such feelings as seem'd innocent,
     For objects worthy of the sentiment.
     Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,
       That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
     She had heard; but women hear with more good humour
       Such aberrations than we men of rigour:
     Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
       Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;
     Because he had, like Alcibiades,
     The art of living in all climes with ease.
     His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
       Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;
     Nothing affected, studied, or constructive
       Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse
     Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,
       To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,
     And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
     Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.
     They are wrong--that 's not the way to set about it;
       As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
     But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
       In fact, his manner was his own alone;
     Sincere he was--at least you could not doubt it,
       In listening merely to his voice's tone.
     The devil hath not in all his quiver's choice
     An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.
     By nature soft, his whole address held off
       Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
     Was such as rather seem'd to keep aloof,
       To shield himself than put you on your guard:
     Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
       But modesty 's at times its own reward,
     Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
     Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.
     Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;
       Insinuating without insinuation;
     Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
       Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
     Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
       So as to make them feel he knew his station
     And theirs:--without a struggle for priority,
     He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.
     That is, with men: with women he was what
       They pleased to make or take him for; and their
     Imagination 's quite enough for that:
       So that the outline 's tolerably fair,
     They fill the canvas up--and 'verbum sat.'
       If once their phantasies be brought to bear
     Upon an object, whether sad or playful,
     They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.
     Adeline, no deep judge of character,
       Was apt to add a colouring from her own:
     'T is thus the good will amiably err,
       And eke the wise, as has been often shown.
     Experience is the chief philosopher,
       But saddest when his science is well known:
     And persecuted sages teach the schools
     Their folly in forgetting there are fools.
     Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?
       Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,
     Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,
       And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
     Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,
       How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
     Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
     But leave them to the conscience of the nations.
     I perch upon an humbler promontory,
       Amidst life's infinite variety:
     With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
       But speculating as I cast mine eye
     On what may suit or may not suit my story,
       And never straining hard to versify,
     I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk
     With any body in a ride or walk.
     I don't know that there may be much ability
       Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
     But there 's a conversational facility,
       Which may round off an hour upon a time.
     Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility
       In mine irregularity of chime,
     Which rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,
     Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'
     'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere--dic aliquando
       Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'
     The first is rather more than mortal can do;
       The second may be sadly done or gaily;
     The third is still more difficult to stand to;
       The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.
     The whole together is what I could wish
     To serve in this conundrum of a dish.
     A modest hope--but modesty 's my forte,
       And pride my feeble:--let us ramble on.
     I meant to make this poem very short,
       But now I can't tell where it may not run.
     No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
       To critics, or to hail the setting sun
     Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
     Were more;--but I was born for opposition.
     But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
       So that I verily believe if they
     Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
       Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'
     Though at the first I might perchance deride
       Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
     And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
     Because I hate even democratic royalty.
     I think I should have made a decent spouse,
       If I had never proved the soft condition;
     I think I should have made monastic vows,
       But for my own peculiar superstition:
     'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,
       Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
     Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
     If some one had not told me to forego it.
     But 'laissez aller'--knights and dames I sing,
       Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
     Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
       Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:
     The difficultly lies in colouring
       (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
     With nature manners which are artificial,
     And rend'ring general that which is especial.
     The difference is, that in the days of old
       Men made the manners; manners now make men--
     Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
       At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
     Now this at all events must render cold
       Your writers, who must either draw again
     Days better drawn before, or else assume
     The present, with their common-place costume.
     We 'll do our best to make the best on 't:--March!
       March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
     And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
       Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.
     We surely may find something worth research:
       Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
     Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,
     While yet America was in her non-age.
     When Adeline, in all her growing sense
       Of Juan's merits and his situation,
     Felt on the whole an interest intense,--
       Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
     Or that he had an air of innocence,
       Which is for innocence a sad temptation,--
     As women hate half measures, on the whole,
     She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.
     She had a good opinion of advice,
       Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
     For which small thanks are still the market price,
       Even where the article at highest rate is:
     She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
       And morally decided, the best state is
     For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
     She seriously advised him to get married.
     Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
       He had a predilection for that tie;
     But that, at present, with immediate reference
       To his own circumstances, there might lie
     Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
       Or that of her to whom he might apply:
     That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
     If that they were not married all already.
     Next to the making matches for herself,
       And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
     Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
       There 's nothing women love to dabble in
     More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
       Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
     Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
     That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.
     But never yet (except of course a miss
       Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
     Or wed already, who object to this)
       Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
     Some drama of the marriage unities,
       Observed as strictly both at board and bed
     As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
     They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.
     They generally have some only son,
       Some heir to a large property, some friend
     Of an old family, some gay Sir john,
       Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
     A line, and leave posterity undone,
       Unless a marriage was applied to mend
     The prospect and their morals: and besides,
     They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.
     From these they will be careful to select,
       For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
     For one a songstress who hath no defect,
       For t' other one who promises much duty;
     For this a lady no one can reject,
       Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;
     A second for her excellent connections;
     A third, because there can be no objections.
     When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
       In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes
     Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
       Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,
     Without those sad expenses which disparage
       What Nature naturally most encourages)--
     Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?
     Now here I 've got the preacher at a dead lock.
     Because he either meant to sneer at harmony
       Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.
     But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany
       Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,
     Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any
       Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.
     My objection 's to his title, not his ritual,
     Although I wonder how it grew habitual.
     But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
       Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation--
     Professors of that genial art, and patrons
       Of all the modest part of propagation;
     Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
       That half its produce tends to emigration,
     That sad result of passions and potatoes--
     Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.
     Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
       I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,
     Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
       This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
     'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
       Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;
     But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
     Or turning marriage into arithmetic.
     But Adeline, who probably presumed
       That Juan had enough of maintenance,
     Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd--
       As on the whole it is an even chance
     That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
       May retrograde a little in the dance
     Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
     Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'--but 't is the same);--
     But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
       In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:
     But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
       Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.
     And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
       She deem'd his merits something more than common:
     All these were unobjectionable matches,
     And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.
     There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,
       That usual paragon, an only daughter,
     Who seem'd the cream of equanimity
       Till skimm'd--and then there was some milk and water,
     With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
       Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
     Love 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,
     And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.
     And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
       A dashing demoiselle of good estate,
     Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;
       But whether English dukes grew rare of late,
     Or that she had not harp'd upon the true string,
       By which such sirens can attract our great,
     She took up with some foreign younger brother,
     A Russ or Turk--the one 's as good as t' other.
     And then there was--but why should I go on,
       Unless the ladies should go off?--there was
     Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,
       Of the best class, and better than her class,--
     Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
       O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,
     A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;
     Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only
       Child to the care of guardians good and kind;
     But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
       Blood is not water; and where shall we find
     Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
       By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
     To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
     Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?
     Early in years, and yet more infantine
       In figure, she had something of sublime
     In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
       All youth--but with an aspect beyond time;
     Radiant and grave--as pitying man's decline;
       Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,
     She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.
     And grieved for those who could return no more.
     She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,
       As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
     And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear
       Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud
     Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear
       Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd
     To novel power; and as she was the last,
     She held their old faith and old feelings fast.
     She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,
       As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
     As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
       And kept her heart serene within its zone.
     There was awe in the homage which she drew;
       Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
     Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
     In its own strength--most strange in one so young!
     Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue
       Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,
     Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue
       Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
     Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
       Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
     By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
     Of single gentlemen who would be double.
     And this omission, like that of the bust
       Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,
     Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
       This he express'd half smiling and half serious;
     When Adeline replied with some disgust,
       And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
     She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby
     As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'
     Juan rejoin'd--'She was a Catholic,
       And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
     Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,
       And the Pope thunder excommunication,
     If-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique
       Herself extremely on the inoculation
     Of others with her own opinions, stated--
     As usual--the same reason which she late did.
     And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
       If good, is none the worse for repetition;
     If bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,
       And amplify: you lose much by concision,
     Whereas insisting in or out of season
       Convinces all men, even a politician;
     Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.
     So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?
     Why Adeline had this slight prejudice--
       For prejudice it was--against a creature
     As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
       With all the added charm of form and feature,
     For me appears a question far too nice,
       Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
     But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
     Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.
     Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
       With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
     Which charm most people in their earlier day:
       For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
     And womankind too, if we so may say,
       Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
     Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few
     Who look upon them as they ought to do.
     It was not envy--Adeline had none;
       Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
     It was not scorn--which could not light on one
       Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.
     It was not jealousy, I think: but shun
       Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.
     It was not--but 't is easier far, alas!
     To say what it was not than what it was.
     Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme
       Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
     A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
       Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,
     Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam
       Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.
     Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--
     She had so much, or little, of the child.
     The dashing and proud air of Adeline
       Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze
     Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,
       Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.
     Juan was something she could not divine,
       Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;
     Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,
     Because she did not pin her faith on feature.
     His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame
       Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,
     A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
       Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
     Faults which attract because they are not tame;
       Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:--
     These seals upon her wax made no impression,
     Such was her coldness or her self-possession.
     Juan knew nought of such a character--
       High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
     Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:
       The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,
     More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
       Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,
     Nor would be thus:--the difference in them
     Was such as lies between a flower and gem.
     Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
       Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,
     And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'
       Scott, the superlative of my comparative--
     Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,
       Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if
     There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,
     Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.
     I say, in my slight way I may proceed
       To play upon the surface of humanity.
     I write the world, nor care if the world read,
       At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
     My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
       More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I
     Thought that it might turn out so--now I know it,
     But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.
     The conference or congress (for it ended
       As congresses of late do) of the Lady
     Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
       Some acids with the sweets--for she was heady;
     But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,
       The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,
     But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
     Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.
     Great things were now to be achieved at table,
       With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
     For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able
       (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)
     To draw up in array a single day-bill
       Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,
     In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,
       Than witches, bches, or physicians, brew.
     There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
       Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,
     A turbot for relief of those who cram,
       Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'
     There also wasthe sinner that I am!
       How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-
     'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,
     Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.
     But I must crowd all into one grand mess
       Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,
     My Muse would run much more into excess,
       Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.
     But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess
       Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
     However doth require some slight refection,
     Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.
     Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,
       With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;
     Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--
       A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
     They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
       Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
     And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
     As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.
     Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'
       'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
     With things I can't withstand or understand,
       Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
     And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
       Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
     While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
     (There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.
     What are the fillets on the victor's brow
       To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch
     Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
       Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
     Gone to where victories must like dinners go.
       Farther I shall not follow the research:
     But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
     When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?
     Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
       Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'--a dish
     Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
       So every one may dress it to his wish,
     According to the best of dictionaries,
       Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;
     But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,
     There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'
     The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
       Of intellect expanded on two courses;
     And indigestion's grand multiplication
       Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
     Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
       That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,
     As form a science and a nomenclature
     From out the commonest demands of nature?
     The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
       The diners of celebrity dined well;
     The ladies with more moderation mingled
       In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;
     Also the younger men too: for a springald
       Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,
     But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
     (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.
     Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,
       The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
     All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
       Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
     I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
       'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
     But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
     The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'
     And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
       From nature for the service of the gout--
     Taste or the gout,--pronounce it as inclines
       Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;
     But after, there are sometimes certain signs
       Which prove plain English truer of the two.
     Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it--
     But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.
     The simple olives, best allies of wine,
       Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
     I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine
       In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:
     On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,
       The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,
     On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
     Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.
     Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,
       And vegetables, all in masquerade,
     The guests were placed according to their roll,
       But various as the various meats display'd:
     Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
       No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
     But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
     Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.
     By some odd chance too, he was placed between
       Aurora and the Lady Adeline--
     A situation difficult, I ween,
       For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
     Also the conference which we have seen
       Was not such as to encourage him to shine;
     For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
     With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.
     I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
       This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things
     Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
       Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
     Like that same mystic music of the spheres,
       Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,
     'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard
     Long dialogues--which pass'd without a word!
     Aurora sat with that indifference
       Which piques a preux chevalier--as it ought:
     Of all offences that 's the worst offence,
       Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
     Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,
       Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
     Like a good ship entangled among ice,
     And after so much excellent advice.
     To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
       Or something which was nothing, as urbanity
     Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,
       Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
     The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
       Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?
     Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
     Sparkled with her successful prophecies,
     And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
       A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
     Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
       Both in the case of lover and of friend,
     Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
       To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
     For all men prophesy what is or was,
     And hate those who won't let them come to pass.
     Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
       Slight but select, and just enough to express,
     To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
       That he would rather make them more than less.
     Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
       Though probably much less a fact than guess)
     So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,
     As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.
     From answering she began to question; this
       With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet
     Thought her predictions went not much amiss,
       Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--
     So very difficult, they say, it is
       To keep extremes from meeting, when once set
     In motion; but she here too much refined--
     Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.
     But Juan had a sort of winning way,
       A proud humility, if such there be,
     Which show'd such deference to what females say,
       As if each charming word were a decree.
     His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
       And taught him when to be reserved or free:
     He had the art of drawing people out,
     Without their seeing what he was about.
     Aurora, who in her indifference
       Confounded him in common with the crowd
     Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense
       Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--
     Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)
       To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
     Rather by deference than compliment,
     And wins even by a delicate dissent.
     And then he had good looks;--that point was carried
       Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve
     To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married--
       A case which to the juries we may leave,
     Since with digressions we too long have tarried.
       Now though we know of old that looks deceive,
     And always have done, somehow these good looks
     Make more impression than the best of books.
     Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,
       Was very young, although so very sage,
     Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
       Especially upon a printed page.
     But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
       Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
     And Socrates, that model of all duty,
     Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.
     And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
       But innocently so, as Socrates;
     And really, if the sage sublime and Attic
       At seventy years had phantasies like these,
     Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
       Has shown, I know not why they should displease
     In virgins--always in a modest way,
     Observe; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'
     Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
       (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd
     Opinions two, which at first sight may look
       Twin opposites, the second is the best.
     Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,
       Or none at all--which seems a sorry jest:
     But if a writer should be quite consistent,
     How could he possibly show things existent?
     If people contradict themselves, can I
       Help contradicting them, and every body,
     Even my veracious self?--But that 's a lie:
       I never did so, never will--how should I?
     He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
       Truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,
     And cut through such canals of contradiction,
     That she must often navigate o'er fiction.
     Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
       Are false, but may he render'd also true,
     By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.
       'T is wonderful what fable will not do!
     'T is said it makes reality more bearable:
       But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
     Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.
     Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?
     Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;
       Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
     God help us! Since we have need on our career
       To keep our holy beacons always bright,
     'T is time that some new prophet should appear,
       Or old indulge man with a second sight.
     Opinions wear out in some thousand years,
     Without a small refreshment from the spheres.
     But here again, why will I thus entangle
       Myself with metaphysics? None can hate
     So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
       And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
     I always knock my head against some angle
       About the present, past, or future state.
     Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,
     For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.
     But though I am a temperate theologian,
       And also meek as a metaphysician,
     Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
       As Eldon on a lunatic commission--
     In politics my duty is to show John
       Bull something of the lower world's condition.
     It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,
     To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.
     But politics, and policy, and piety,
       Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
     Not only for the sake of their variety,
       But as subservient to a moral use;
     Because my business is to dress society,
       And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
     And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
     Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.
     And now I will give up all argument;
       And positively henceforth no temptation
     Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-
       Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
     Indeed, I never knew what people meant
       By deeming that my Muse's conversation
     Was dangerous;--I think she is as harmless
     As some who labour more and yet may charm less.
     Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
       No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!
     And don't regret the time you may have lost,
       For you have got that pleasure still to come:
     And do not think I mean to sneer at most
       Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
     That source of the sublime and the mysterious:--
     For certain reasons my belief is serious.
     Serious? You laugh;--you may: that will I not;
       My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
     I say I do believe a haunted spot
       Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,
     Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,
       'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.
     In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very
     Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.
     The night (I sing by night--sometimes an owl,
       And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
     And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
       Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
     Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl--
       I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;
     The dying embers dwindle in the grate--
     I think too that I have sate up too late:
     And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
       To rhyme at noon--when I have other things
     To think of, if I ever think--I say
       I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
     And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
       Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
     Shadows;--but you must be in my condition
     Before you learn to call this superstition.
   The antique Persians taught three useful things,
       To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.
     This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--
       A mode adopted since by modern youth.
     Bows have they, generally with two strings;
       Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
     At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
     But draw the long bow better now than ever.
     The cause of this effect, or this defect,--
       'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
     Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
       But this I must say in my own applause,
     Of all the Muses that I recollect,
       Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
     In some things, mine 's beyond all contradiction
     The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.
     And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats
       From any thing, this epic will contain
     A wilderness of the most rare conceits,
       Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
     'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,
       Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,
     But wonder they so few are, since my tale is
     'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'
     But of all truths which she has told, the most
       True is that which she is about to tell.
     I said it was a story of a ghost--
       What then? I only know it so befell.
     Have you explored the limits of the coast,
       Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
     'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as
     The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.
     Some people would impose now with authority,
       Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;
     Men whose historical superiority
       Is always greatest at a miracle.
     But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
       Who bids all men believe the impossible,
     Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
     Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'
     And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
       Believe:--if 't is improbable you must,
     And if it is impossible, you shall:
       'T is always best to take things upon trust.
     I do not speak profanely, to recall
       Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
     Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,
     As all truths must, the more they are disputed:
     I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
       That in the course of some six thousand years,
     All nations have believed that from the dead
       A visitant at intervals appears;
     And what is strangest upon this strange head,
       Is, that whatever bar the reason rears
     'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still
     In its behalf, let those deny who will.
     The dinner and the soiree too were done,
       The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
     The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one--
       The song was silent, and the dance expired:
     The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone
       Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
     And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
     Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.
     The evaporation of a joyous day
       Is like the last glass of champagne, without
     The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
       Or like a system coupled with a doubt;
     Or like a soda bottle when its spray
       Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
     Or like a billow left by storms behind,
     Without the animation of the wind;
     Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
       Or none; or like--like nothing that I know
     Except itself;--such is the human breast;
       A thing, of which similitudes can show
     No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest
       Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
     If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.
     So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!
     But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
       Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre
     May sit like that of Nessus, and recall
       Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.
     Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all
       The nights and days most people can remember
     (I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),
     I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.
     And Juan, on retiring for the night,
       Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:
     He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
       Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
     If he had known exactly his own plight,
       He probably would have philosophised:
     A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
     Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.
     He sigh'd;--the next resource is the full moon,
       Where all sighs are deposited; and now
     It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone
       As clear as such a climate will allow;
     And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
       To hail her with the apostrophe--'O thou!'
     Of amatory egotism the Tuism,
     Which further to explain would be a truism.
     But lover, poet, or astronomer,
       Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
     Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
       Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
     Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
       Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
     The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,
     And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.
     Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
       For contemplation rather than his pillow:
     The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
       Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,
     With all the mystery by midnight caused;
       Below his window waved (of course) a willow;
     And he stood gazing out on the cascade
     That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.
     Upon his table or his toilet,--which
       Of these is not exactly ascertain'd
     (I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch
       Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),--
     A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,
       Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,
     In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
     That time has left our fathers of their hall.
     Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
       His chamber door wide open--and went forth
     Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,
       Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,
     Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
       As doubtless should be people of high birth.
     But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
     Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.
     The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint
       Look living in the moon; and as you turn
     Backward and forward to the echoes faint
       Of your own footsteps--voices from the urn
     Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
       Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
     As if to ask how you can dare to keep
     A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.
     And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,
       The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,
     Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave
       Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
     On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,
       But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
     A picture is the past; even ere its frame
     Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.
     As Juan mused on mutability,
       Or on his mistress--terms synonymous--
     No sound except the echo of his sigh
       Or step ran sadly through that antique house;
     When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
       A supernatural agent--or a mouse,
     Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass
     Most people as it plays along the arras.
     It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd
       In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
     Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
       With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
     His garments only a slight murmur made;
       He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
     But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
     Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.
     Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
       Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
     But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
       Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
     Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,
       Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
     But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
     And did he see this? or was it a vapour?
     Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd--the thing of air,
       Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;
     And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
       Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
     As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
       Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
     He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
     To ask the reverend person what he wanted.
     The third time, after a still longer pause,
       The shadow pass'd away--but where? the hall
     Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
       To think his vanishing unnatural:
     Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
       Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
     Might come or go; but Juan could not state
     Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.
     He stood--how long he knew not, but it seem'd
       An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes
     Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;
       Then by degrees recall'd his energies,
     And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
       But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
     Waking already, and return'd at length
     Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.
     All there was as he left it: still his taper
       Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
     Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;
       He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
     Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
       The paper was right easy to peruse;
     He read an article the king attacking,
     And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'
     This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook--
       He shut his door, and after having read
     A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
       Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.
     There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,
       With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
     And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
     Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.
     He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
       Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,
     And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
       At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
     The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
       In the mean time, his valet, whose precision
     Was great, because his master brook'd no less,
     Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.
     He dress'd; and like young people he was wont
       To take some trouble with his toilet, but
     This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
       Aside his very mirror soon was put;
     His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
       His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
     His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
     Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.
     And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
       He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
     Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,
       Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
     Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
       So much distrait he was, that all could see
     That something was the matter--Adeline
     The first--but what she could not well divine.
     She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
       Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
     Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.
       Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,
       And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
     Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
     Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.
     But seeing him all cold and silent still,
       And everybody wondering more or less,
     Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'
       He started, and said, 'Yes--no--rather--yes.'
     The family physician had great skill,
       And being present, now began to express
     His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
     The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'
     'Quite well; yes,--no.'--These answers were mysterious,
       And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,
     However they might savour of delirious;
       Something like illness of a sudden growth
     Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:
       But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth
     To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted
     It was not the physician that he wanted.
     Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,
       Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,
     Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,
       At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
     Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
       Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
     With some slight, light, hereditary twinges
     Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.
     Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd
       A few words of condolence on his state:
     'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest
       Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'
     'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best
       To put the question with an air sedate,
     Or careless; but the effort was not valid
     To hinder him from growing still more pallid.
     'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
       The spirit of these walls?'--'In truth not I.'
     'Why Fame--but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar--
       Tells an odd story, of which by and by:
     Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,
       Or that our sires had a more gifted eye
     For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
     The friar of late has not been oft perceived.
    "The last time was""I pray," said Adeline
       (Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,
     And from its context thought she could divine
       Connexions stronger then he chose to avow
     With this same legend)--'if you but design
       To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,
     Because the present tale has oft been told,
     And is not much improved by growing old.'
     'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know
       That we ourselves--'t was in the honey-moon--
     Saw""Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;
       But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'
     Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,
       She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
     As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
     The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'
     'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;
       For Adeline is half a poetess,'
     Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.
       Of course the others could not but express
     In courtesy their wish to see display'd
       By one three talents, for there were no less--
     The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once
     Could hardly be united by a dunce.
     After some fascinating hesitation,--
       The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
     I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--
       Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground
     At first, then kindling into animation,
       Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
     And sang with much simplicity,--a merit
     Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.
          Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            Who sitteth by Norman stone,
          For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
            And his mass of the days that are gone.
          When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
            Made Norman Church his prey,
          And expell'd the friars, one friar still
            Would not be driven away.
          Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
            To turn church lands to lay,
          With sword in hand, and torch to light
            Their walls, if they said nay;
          A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,
            And he did not seem form'd of clay,
          For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,
            Though he is not seen by day.
          And whether for good, or whether for ill,
            It is not mine to say;
          But still with the house of Amundeville
            He abideth night and day.
          By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,
            He flits on the bridal eve;
          And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death
            He comes--but not to grieve.
          When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
            And when aught is to befall
          That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
            He walks from hall to hall.
          His form you may trace, but not his face,
            'T is shadow'd by his cowl;
          But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
            And they seem of a parted soul.
          But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            He still retains his sway,
          For he is yet the church's heir
            Whoever may be the lay.
          Amundeville is lord by day,
            But the monk is lord by night;
          Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
            To question that friar's right.
          Say nought to him as he walks the hall,
            And he 'll say nought to you;
          He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
            As o'er the grass the dew.
          Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;
            Heaven sain him, fair or foul!
          And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
            Let ours be for his soul.
     The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
       Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
     And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
       Pervades a moment those who listen round;
     And then of course the circle much admires,
       Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
     The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
     To the performer's diffident confusion.
     Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
       As if she rated such accomplishment
     As the mere pastime of an idle day,
       Pursued an instant for her own content,
     Would now and then as 't were without display,
       Yet with display in fact, at times relent
     To such performances with haughty smile,
     To show she could, if it were worth her while.
     Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
       Was--pardon the pedantic illustration--
     Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
       As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
     Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
       Or thrown into a philosophic passion,
     For a spoil'd carpet--but the 'Attic Bee'
     Was much consoled by his own repartee.
     Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
       (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
     What dilettanti do with vast parade)
       Their sort of half profession; for it grows
     To something like this when too oft display'd;
       And that it is so everybody knows
     Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
     Show off--to please their company or mother.
     O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
       The admirations and the speculations;
     The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
       The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
     The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
       Amongst our own most musical of nations;
     With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
     To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.
     In Babylon's bravuras--as the home
       Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
     That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
       O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
     The calentures of music which o'ercome
       All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
     No more to be beheld but in such visions--
     Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.
     She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'
       Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,
     Made epigrams occasionally too
       Upon her friends, as everybody ought.
     But still from that sublimer azure hue,
       So much the present dye, she was remote;
     Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,
     And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.
     Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,
       Which now-a-days is the thermometer
     By whose degrees all characters are class'd--
       Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.
     The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste
       Had more of her existence, for in her
     There was a depth of feeling to embrace
     Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.
     Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
       The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
     If she had any, was upon her face,
       And that was of a fascinating kind.
     A little turn for mischief you might trace
       Also thereon,--but that 's not much; we find
     Few females without some such gentle leaven,
     For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.
     I have not heard she was at all poetic,
       Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'
     And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
       Because she said her temper had been tried
     So much, the bard had really been prophetic
       Of what she had gone through with--since a bride.
     But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
     Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'
     'T were difficult to say what was the object
       Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay
     To bear on what appear'd to her the subject
       Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
     Perhaps she merely had the simple project
       To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
     Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
     Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.
     But so far the immediate effect
       Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
     A thing quite necessary to the elect,
       Who wish to take the tone of their society:
     In which you cannot be too circumspect,
       Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
     But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
     On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.
     And therefore Juan now began to rally
       His spirits, and without more explanation
     To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
       Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
     With various similar remarks to tally,
       But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration
     Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
     About the present family's deaths and wooings.
     Of these few could say more than has been said;
       They pass'd as such things do, for superstition
     With some, while others, who had more in dread
       The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
     And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:
       But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
     Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)
     Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.
     And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
       The company prepared to separate;
     Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
       Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.
     There was a goodly match too, to be run
       Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
     And a young race-horse of old pedigree
     Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.
     There was a picture-dealer who had brought
       A special Titian, warranted original,
     So precious that it was not to be bought,
       Though princes the possessor were besieging all.
     The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought
       The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all
     His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
     Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.
     But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--
       The friend of artists, if not arts,--the owner,
     With motives the most classical and pure,
       So that he would have been the very donor,
     Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,
       So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,
     Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
     But for his judgment--never known to fail.
     There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
       Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,
     Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,
       Might have from time acquired some slight defect;
     Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick
       And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
     New buildings of correctest conformation,
     And throw down old--which he call'd restoration.
     The cost would be a trifle--an 'old song,'
       Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden
     Of that same tune, when people hum it long)--
       The price would speedily repay its worth in
     An edifice no less sublime than strong,
       By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
     Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,
     For Gothic daring shown in English money.
     There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
       Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;
     Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
       And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,
     Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,
       'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'
     There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
     For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.
     There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
       Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;
     There was a country girl in a close cap
       And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--
     Since--since--in youth, I had the sad mishap--
       But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
     That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
     Presents the problem of a double figure.
     A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
       One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
     Therefore the present piece of natural history
       I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
     And merely state, though not for the consistory,
       Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout
     The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
     Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.
     Now justices of peace must judge all pieces
       Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
     And morals of the country from caprices
       Of those who have not a license for the same;
     And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
       Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
     Preserving partridges and pretty wenches
     Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.
     The present culprit was extremely pale,
       Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red
     By nature, as in higher dames less hale
       'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.
     Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
       Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,
     And knew no better in her immorality
     Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.
     Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,
       Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
     Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,
       For she was not a sentimental mourner
     Parading all her sensibility,
       Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
     But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
     To be call'd up for her examination.
     Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,
       Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.
     The lawyers in the study; and in air
       The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent
     From town, viz., architect and dealer, were
       Both busy (as a general in his tent
     Writing despatches) in their several stations,
     Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.
     But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
       While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
     Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
       A mighty mug of moral double ale.
     She waited until justice could recall
       Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
     To name a thing in nomenclature rather
     Perplexing for most virgins--a child's father.
     You see here was enough of occupation
       For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.
     There was much bustle too, and preparation
       Below stairs on the score of second courses;
     Because, as suits their rank and situation,
       Those who in counties have great land resources
     Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
     Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'
     But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
       (Thus we translate a general invitation),
     All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
       May drop in without cards, and take their station
     At the full board, and sit alike delighted
       With fashionable wines and conversation;
     And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
     Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.
     Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
       Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
     But county contests cost him rather dearer,
       Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
     Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;
       His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
     Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning
     The same self-interest, with a different leaning).
     Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
       He was all things to all men, and dispensed
     To some civility, to others bounty,
       And promises to all--which last commenced
     To gather to a somewhat large amount, he
       Not calculating how much they condensed;
     But what with keeping some, and breaking others,
     His word had the same value as another's.
     A friend to freedom and freeholders--yet
       No less a friend to government--he held,
     That he exactly the just medium hit
       'Twixt place and patriotism--albeit compell'd,
     Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,
       He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),
     To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,
     But that with them all law would be demolish'd.
     He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
       Is 't English? No--'t is only parliamentary)
     That innovation's spirit now-a-days
       Had made more progress than for the last century.
     He would not tread a factious path to praise,
       Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;
     As for his place, he could but say this of it,
     That the fatigue was greater than the profit.
     Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
       Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
     But could he quit his king in times of strife,
       Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?
     When demagogues would with a butcher's knife
       Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
     The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings
     Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.
     Sooner 'come lace into the civil list
       And champion him to the utmost'--he would keep it,
     Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:
       Profit he care not for, let others reap it;
     But should the day come when place ceased to exist,
       The country would have far more cause to weep it:
     For how could it go on? Explain who can!
     He gloried in the name of Englishman.
     He was as independent--ay, much more--
       Than those who were not paid for independence,
     As common soldiers, or a common--shore,
       Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
     O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
       Who do not give professional attendance.
     Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager
     To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.
     All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
       And thought. I say no more--I 've said too much;
     For all of us have either heard or read--
       Off--or upon the hustings--some slight such
     Hints from the independent heart or head
       Of the official candidate. I 'll touch
     No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,
     And grace is said; the grace I should have sung--
     But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
       'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old
     Was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray
       Were something very glorious to behold.
     But 't was a public feast and public day,--
       Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,
     Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,
     And every body out of their own sphere.
     The squires familiarly formal, and
       My lords and ladies proudly condescending;
     The very servants puzzling how to hand
       Their plates--without it might be too much bending
     From their high places by the sideboard's stand--
       Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.
     For any deviation from the graces
     Might cost both man and master too--their places.
     There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
       Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;
     Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen
       Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
     Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
       There were some massy members of the church,
     Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,
     And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.
     There were some country wags too--and, alas!
       Some exiles from the town, who had been driven
     To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,
       And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
     And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
       I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,
     The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,
     The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.
     I knew him in his livelier London days,
       A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
     And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,
       Until preferment, coming at a sure rate
     (O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!
       Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),
     Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,
     A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.
     His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
       But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
     For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.
       No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
     Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:
       The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
     Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,
     To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.
     There is a difference, says the song, 'between
       A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
     The latter worse used of the two we 've seen--
       But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
     A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
       A difference between crockery ware and plate,
     As between English beef and Spartan broth--
     And yet great heroes have been bred by both.
     But of all nature's discrepancies, none
       Upon the whole is greater than the difference
     Beheld between the country and the town,
       Of which the latter merits every preference
     From those who have few resources of their own,
       And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
     To some small plan of interest or ambition--
     Both which are limited to no condition.
     But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
       Long banquets and too many guests, although
     A slight repast makes people love much more,
       Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
     Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
       With vivifying Venus, who doth owe
     To these the invention of champagne and truffles:
     Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.
     Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
       And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
     Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,
       And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
     Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,
       He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
     Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish
     (Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.
     On which, at the third asking of the bans,
       He started; and perceiving smiles around
     Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
       And hastily--as nothing can confound
     A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--
       Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,
     And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
     He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.
     This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
       The supplicator being an amateur;
     But others, who were left with scarce a third,
       Were angry--as they well might, to be sure.
     They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
       Lord Henry at his table should endure;
     And this, and his not knowing how much oats
     Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.
     They little knew, or might have sympathised,
       That he the night before had seen a ghost,
     A prologue which but slightly harmonised
       With the substantial company engross'd
     By matter, and so much materialised,
       That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
     Of two things--how (the question rather odd is)
     Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.
     But what confused him more than smile or stare
       From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,
     Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
       Especially as he had been renown'd
     For some vivacity among the fair,
       Even in the country circle's narrow bound
     (For little things upon my lord's estate
     Were good small talk for others still less great)--
     Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,
       And something like a smile upon her cheek.
     Now this he really rather took amiss:
       In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak
     A strong external motive; and in this
       Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique
     Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles
     Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.
     'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
       Indicative of some surprise and pity;
     And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
       Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
     Since he had gain'd at least her observation,
       A most important outwork of the city--
     As Juan should have known, had not his senses
     By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.
     But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
       Nor seem embarrass'd--quite the contrary;
     Her aspect was as usual, still--not stern--
       And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
     Yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?
       I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--
     Though sometimes faintly flush'd--and always clear,
     As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.
     But Adeline was occupied by fame
       This day; and watching, witching, condescending
     To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,
       And dignity with courtesy so blending,
     As all must blend whose part it is to aim
       (Especially as the sixth year is ending)
     At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
     Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.
     Though this was most expedient on the whole,
       And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance
     On Adeline while playing her grand role,
       Which she went through as though it were a dance,
     Betraying only now and then her soul
       By a look scarce perceptibly askance
     (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
     Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;
     So well she acted all and every part
       By turns--with that vivacious versatility,
     Which many people take for want of heart.
       They err--'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
     A thing of temperament and not of art,
       Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
     And false--though true; for surely they 're sincerest
     Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.
     This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
       Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never;
     But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
       Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;
     Most orators, but very few financiers,
       Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,
     Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,
     And grow quite figurative with their figures.
     The poets of arithmetic are they
       Who, though they prove not two and two to be
     Five, as they might do in a modest way,
       Have plainly made it out that four are three,
     Judging by what they take, and what they pay.
       The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,
     That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
     The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.
     While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,
       The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
     Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,
       Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
     The ridicules of people in all places--
       That honey of your fashionable bees--
     And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
     And this at present was her kind employment.
     However, the day closed, as days must close;
       The evening also waned--and coffee came.
     Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
       And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
     Retired: with most unfashionable bows
       Their docile esquires also did the same,
     Delighted with their dinner and their host,
     But with the Lady Adeline the most.
     Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
       The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
     Was obvious in each feature of her face,
       Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
     Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
       No one could envy her deserved prosperity.
     And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity
     Draperied her form with curious felicity!
     Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,
       By an impartial indemnification
     For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
       In a most edifying conversation,
     Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,
       And families, even to the last relation;
     Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
     And truculent distortion of their tresses.
     True, she said little--'t was the rest that broke
       Forth into universal epigram;
     But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
       Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
     Her own but served to set off every joke,
       As music chimes in with a melodrame.
     How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
     I ask but this of mine, to--not defend.
     There were but two exceptions to this keen
       Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one
     Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;
       And Juan, too, in general behind none
     In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
       Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
     In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
     He would not join them in a single sally.
     'T is true he saw Aurora look as though
       She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook
     Its motive for that charity we owe
       But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
     Farther--it might or might not be so.
       But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
     Observing little in his reverie,
     Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.
     The ghost at least had done him this much good,
       In making him as silent as a ghost,
     If in the circumstances which ensued
       He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
     And certainly Aurora had renew'd
       In him some feelings he had lately lost,
     Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
     Are so divine, that I must deem them real:--
     The love of higher things and better days;
       The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
     Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;
       The moments when we gather from a glance
     More joy than from all future pride or praise,
       Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
     The heart in an existence of its own,
     Of which another's bosom is the zone.
     Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian
       That hath a memory, or that had a heart?
     Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
       Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.
     Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
       Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart
     Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,
     Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'
     And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
       Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
     Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows
       Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
     Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows
       Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond
     Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
     And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.
     The night was as before: he was undrest,
       Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;
     Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;
       In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:
     But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
       He sate with feelings awkward to express
     (By those who have not had such visitations),
     Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.
     And not in vain he listen'd;--Hush! what 's that?
       I see--I see--Ah, no!--'t is not--yet 't is--
     Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!
       The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
     So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,
       Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
     Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
     And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.
     Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no--this time
       It is the sable friar as before,
     With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
       Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
     Again through shadows of the night sublime,
       When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
     The starry darkness round her like a girdle
     Spangled with gems--the monk made his blood curdle.
     A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
       Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
     Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
       Sounding like very supernatural water,
     Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
       For immaterialism 's a serious matter;
     So that even those whose faith is the most great
     In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.
     Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.
       Surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,
     Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through
       As wide as if a long speech were to come.
     Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
       Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:
     His eyes were open, and (as was before
     Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?--the door.
     It open'd with a most infernal creak,
       Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza
     Voi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,
       Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
     Or--but all words upon such themes are weak:
       A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
     Hero--for what is substance to a spirit?
     Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?
     The door flew wide,--not swiftly, but, as fly
       The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,
     And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
       Half letting in long shadows on the light,
     Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,
       For he had two, both tolerably bright,
     And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
     The sable Friar in his solemn hood.
     Between two worlds life hovers like a star,
       'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
     How little do we know that which we are!
       How less what we may be! The eternal surge
     Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar
       Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,
     Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves
     Of empires heave but like some passing waves.
     Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
       The night before, but being sick of shaking,
     He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,
       And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.
     His own internal ghost began to awaken
       Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,
     Hinting that soul and body on the whole
     Were odds against a disembodied soul.
     And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
       And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
     But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
       Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
     Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,
       At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
     The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
     He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.
     Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!
       It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
     On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers
       Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.
     He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
       When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.
     How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
     Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.
     But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
       And rather variably for stony death.
     Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;
       The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
     A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
       A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath
     Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
     The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.
     And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
       His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
     It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
      Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
     He found, as people on most trials must,
       That he had made at first a silly blunder
     And that in his confusion he had caught
     Only the wall, instead of what he sought
     The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
       As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
     A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
       Forth into something much like flesh and blood.
     Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl
       And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
     In full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,
     The phantom of her frolic Grace--Fitz-Fulke!
     [The end of the 1857 edition]
       *  *  *  *  *
   The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
        Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase
     (But many a lonely tree the loftier grows
        Than others crowded in the forest's maze);
     The next are such as are not doomed to lose
        Their tender parents in their budding days,
     But merely their parental tenderness,
     Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.
     The next are 'only children', as they are styled,
        Who grow up children only, since the old saw
     Pronounces that an 'only' 's a spoilt child.
        But not to go too far, I hold it law
     That where their education, harsh or mild,
        'Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,
     The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,
     Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.
     But to return unto the stricter rule
       (As far as words make rules), our common notion
     Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
        A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
     A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
        A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
     Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
     The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.
     Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what
        Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
     With Nature's genial genitors, so that
       A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
     (I'll take the likeness I can first come at),
        Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared
     And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
     The old hen by running headlong to the water.
     There is a commonplace book argument,
       Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue
     When any dare a new light to present:
       'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'
     Suppose the converse of this precedent
       So often urged, so loudly and so long:
     'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'
     Was ever everybody yet so quite?
     Therefore I would solicit free discussion
       Upon all points, no matter what or whose,
     Because as ages upon ages push on,
       The last is apt the former to accuse
     Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
       Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
     What was a paradox becomes a truth or
     A something like it, as bear witness Luther.
     The sacraments have been reduced to two
       And witches unto none, though somewhat late
     Since burning aged women (save a few,
       Not witches, only bitches, who create
     Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
       Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)
     Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
     Malgé  Sir Matthew Hale's great humanity.
     Great Galileo was debarred the sun,
       Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking
     How earth could round the solar orbit run,
       Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.
     The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun
       To think his skull had not some need of caulking,
     But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
     No doubt a consolation to his dust.
     Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates--but pages
        Might be filled up, as vainly as before,
     With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
        Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
     The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;
       This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
     The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
     Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.
     If such doom waits each intellectual giant,
      We little people in our lesser way
     To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
       And so for one will I, as well I may.
     Would that I were less bilious--but oh fie on't!
       Just as I make my mind up everyday
     To be a totus teres stoic, sage,
     The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.
     Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;
       Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;
     Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;
      Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;
     Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;
       Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;
     So that I almost think that the same skin
     For one without has two or three within.
     Our hero was in canto the sixteenth
       Left in a tender moonlight situation,
     Such as enables man to show his strength
       Moral or physical On this occasion
     Whether his virtue triumphed, or at length
       His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--
     Is more than I shall venture to describe,
     Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.
     I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
       The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
     Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
       The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
     My trembling lyre already several strings,
       Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
      The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
     The latest, Juan with his virgin face.
     Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
       'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
     As if he had combated with more than one,
       Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
     The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
       Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
     Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept
     A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.
Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and
fall there with a sigh.
O troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints
in my words.
The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.
It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.
It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.
The mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who
shakes her head and laughs and flies away.
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.
The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement,
dancing water.  Will you carry the burden of their lameness?
Her wistful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night.
Once we dreamt that we were strangers.
We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.
Sorrow is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among
the silent trees.
Some unseen fingers, like idle breeze, are playing upon my heart
the music of the ripples.
"What language is thine, O sea?"
  "The language of eternal question."
"What language is thy answer, O sky?
  "The language of eternal silence."
Listen, my heart, to the whispers of the world with which it
makes love to you.
The mystery of creation is like the darkness of night--it is
great.  Delusions of knowledge are like the fog of the morning.
Do not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high.
I sit at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by
stops for a moment, nods to me and goes.
These little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their
whisper of joy in my mind.
What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.
My wishes are fools, they shout across thy songs, my Master.
Let me but listen.
I cannot choose the best.
The best chooses me.
They throw their shadows before them who carry their lantern on
their back.
That I exist is a perpetual surprise which is life.
"We, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms,
but who are you so silent?"
"I am a mere flower."
Rest belongs to the work as the eyelids to the eyes.
Man is a born child, his power is the power of growth.
God expects answers for the flowers he sends us, not for the sun
and the earth.
The light that plays, like a naked child, among the green leaves
happily knows not that man can lie.

by the claims of love.

bird.

making the music of sadness.

move.

through it.

the moon rises, and the glass lamp, with a bland smile, calls
her, "My dear, dear sister."

near.  The seagulls fly off, the waves roll away and we depart.

listening to the dance-music of the tide in the evening.

The tree gave it.

veiled with mist and rain.

out surprises of beauty.

voice.

discouraged of man.

sound of the sea among these listening pines.

leaves.

her master.

  The world kept it prisoner on her throne.
  Love said to the world, "I am thine."
  The world gave it the freedom of her house.
The mist is like the earth's desire.  It hides the sun for whom
she cries.
Be still, my heart, these great trees are prayers.
The noise of the moment scoffs at the music of the Eternal.
I think of other ages that floated upon the stream of life and
love and death and are forgotten, and I feel the freedom of
passing away.
The sadness of my soul is her bride's veil.
It waits to be lifted in the night.
Death's stamp gives value to the coin of life; making it possible
to buy with life what is truly precious.

flowers will keep themselves blooming all your way.

Branches are roots in the air.
The music of the far-away summer flutters around the Autumn
seeking its former nest.

pocket.

round the old tree.

not been lighted.

silence.

in the endless.

gorgeousness.

trying to catch stars.
The road is lonely in its crowd for it is not loved.

she has put out the lamp.

deepening eventide on this beach when I listen to these waves.

in the air.

cannot see them.

branches fruitful.

all things.

dark, has begun to play and shout.

lonely bride of the storm.

life through the dark unknown.

Gaps are left in life through which comes the sad music of death.
The world has opened its heart of light in the morning.
Come out, my heart, with thy love to meet it.
My thoughts shimmer with these shimmering leaves and my heart
sings with the touch of this sunlight; my life is glad to be
floating with all things into the blue of space, into the dark of
time.
God's great power is in the gentle breeze, not in the storm.
This is a dream in which things are all loose and they oppress.

free.

"I shall do what I can, my Master," said the earthen lamp.

flower.

sleeping birds.

thanks.

When we rejoice in our fulness, then we can part with our fruits
with joy.

the nest of my silence.
Thoughts pass in my mind like flocks of ducks in the sky.
I hear the voice of their wings.
The canal loves to think that rivers exist solely to supply it
with water.
The world has kissed my soul with its pain, asking for its return
in songs.
That which oppresses me, is it my soul trying to come out in the
open, or the soul of the world knocking at my heart for its
entrance?
Thought feeds itself with its own words and grows.
I have dipped the vessel of my heart into this silent hour; it
has filled with love.

the distant hills.

The small truth has words that are clear; the great truth has
great silence.
Your smile was the flowers of your own fields, your talk was the
rustle of your own mountain pines, but your heart was the woman
that we all know.
It is the little things that I leave behind for my loved ones,--
great things are for everyone.
Woman, thou hast encircled the world's heart with the depth of
thy tears as the sea has the earth.
The sunshine greets me with a smile.  The rain, his sad sister,
talks to my heart.
My flower of the day dropped its petals forgotten.
In the evening it ripens into a golden fruit of memory.
I am like the road in the night listening to the footfalls of its
memories in silence.
The evening sky to me is like a window, and a lighted lamp, and a
waiting behind it.
He who is too busy doing good finds no time to be good.
I am the autumn cloud, empty of rain, see my fulness in the field
of ripened rice.

grass.

freedom is mine."

life.

This world is the world of wild storms kept tame with the music
of beauty.

too small.

"Let me keep your footprints in my heart."
The day, with the noise of this little earth, drowns the silence
of all worlds.
The song feels the infinite in the air, the picture in the earth,
the poem in the air and the earth;
For its words have meaning that walks and music that soars.
When the sun goes down to the West, the East of his morning
stands before him in silence.
Let me not put myself wrongly to my world and set it against me.
Praise shames me, for I secretly beg for it.
Let my doing nothing when I have nothing to do become untroubled
in its depth of peace like the evening in the seashore when the
water is silent.
Maiden, your simplicity, like the blueness of the lake, reveals
your depth of truth.
The best does not come alone.  It comes with the company of the
all.
God's right hand is gentle, but terrible is his left hand.
My evening came among the alien trees and spoke in a language
which my morning stars did not know.
Night's darkness is a bag that bursts with the gold of the dawn.
Our desire lends the colours of the rainbow to the mere mists and
vapours of life.
God waits to win back his own flowers as gifts from man's hands.
My sad thoughts tease me asking me their own names.
The service of the fruit is precious, the service of the flower
is sweet, but let my service be the service of the leaves in its
shade of humble devotion.
My heart has spread its sails to the idle winds for the shadowy
island of Anywhere.
Men are cruel, but Man is kind.
Make me thy cup and let my fulness be for thee and for thine.
The storm is like the cry of some god in pain whose love the
earth refuses.
The world does not leak because death is not a crack.
Life has become richer by the love that has been lost.
My friend, your great heart shone with the sunrise of the East
like the snowy summit of a lonely hill in the dawn.
The fountain of death makes the still water of life play.
Those who have everything but thee, my God, laugh at those who
have nothing but thyself.
The movement of life has its rest in its own music.
Kicks only raise dust and not crops from the earth.
Our names are the light that glows on the sea waves at night and
then dies without leaving its signature.
Let him only see the thorns who has eyes to see the rose.
Set bird's wings with gold and it will never again soar in the
sky.
The same lotus of our clime blooms here in the alien water with
the same sweetness, under another name.
In heart's perspective the distance looms large.
The moon has her light all over the sky, her dark spots to
herself.
Do not say, "It is morning," and dismiss it with a name of
yesterday.  See it for the first time as a new-born child that
has no name.
Smoke boasts to the sky, and Ashes to the earth, that they are
brothers to the fire.
The raindrop whispered to the jasmine, "Keep me in your heart for
ever."
The jasmine sighed, "Alas," and dropped to the ground.
Timid thoughts, do not be afraid of me.
I am a poet.
The dim silence of my mind seems filled with crickets' chirp--the
grey twilight of sound.
Rockets, your insult to the stars follows yourself back to the
earth.
Thou hast led me through my crowded travels of the day to my
evening's loneliness.
I wait for its meaning through the stillness of the night.
This life is the crossing of a sea, where we meet in the same
narrow ship.
In death we reach the shore and go to our different worlds.
The stream of truth flows through its channels of mistakes.
My heart is homesick to-day for the one sweet hour across the sea
of time.
The bird-song is the echo of the morning light back from the
earth.
"Are you too proud to kiss me?"  the morning light asks the
buttercup.
"How may I sing to thee and worship, O Sun?"  asked the little
flower.
"By the simple silence of thy purity," answered the sun.
Man is worse than an animal when he is an animal.
Dark clouds become heaven's flowers when kissed by light.
Let not the sword-blade mock its handle for being blunt.
The night's silence, like a deep lamp, is burning with the light
of its milky way.
Around the sunny island of Life swells day and night death's
limitless song of the sea.
Is not this mountain like a flower, with its petals of hills,
drinking the sunlight?
The real with its meaning read wrong and emphasis misplaced is
the unreal.
Find your beauty, my heart, from the world's movement, like the
boat that has the grace of the wind and the water.
The eyes are not proud of their sight but of their eyeglasses.
I live in this little world of mine and am afraid to make it the
least less.  Lift me into thy world and let me have the freedom
gladly to lose my all.
The false can never grow into truth by growing in power.
My heart, with its lapping waves of song, longs to caress this
green world of the sunny day.
Wayside grass, love the star, then your dreams will come out in
flowers.
Let your music, like a sword, pierce the noise of the market to
its heart.
The trembling leaves of this tree touch my heart like the fingers
of an infant child.
This sadness of my soul is her bride's veil.
It waits to be lifted in the night.
The little flower lies in the dust.
It sought the path of the butterfly.
I am in the world of the roads.  The night comes.  Open thy gate,
thou world of the home.
I have sung the songs of thy day.  In the evening let me carry
thy lamp through the stormy path.
I do not ask thee into the house.
Come into my infinite loneliness, my Lover.
Death belongs to life as birth does.  The walk is in the raising
of the foot as in the laying of it down.
I have learnt the simple meaning of thy whispers in flowers and
sunshine--teach me to know thy words in pain and death.
The night's flower was late when the morning kissed her, she
shivered and sighed and dropped to the ground.
Through the sadness of all things I hear the crooning of the
Eternal Mother.
I came to your shore as a stranger, I lived in your house as a
guest, I leave your door as a friend, my earth.
Let my thoughts come to you, when I am gone, like the afterglow
of sunset at the margin of starry silence.
Light in my heart the evening star of rest and then let the night
whisper to me of love.
I am a child in the dark.
I stretch my hands through the coverlet of night for thee,
Mother.
The day of work is done.  Hide my face in your arms, Mother.
Let me dream.
The lamp of meeting burns long; it goes out in a moment at the
parting.
One word keep for me in thy silence, O World, when I am dead, "I
have loved."
We live in this world when we love it.
Let the dead have the immortality of fame, but the living the
immortality of love.
I have seen thee as the half-awakened child sees his mother in
the dusk of the dawn and then smiles and sleeps again.
I shall die again and again to know that life is inexhaustible.
While I was passing with the crowd in the road I saw thy smile
from the balcony and I sang and forgot all noise.
Love is life in its fulness like the cup with its wine.
They light their own lamps and sing their own words in their
temples.
But the birds sing thy name in thine own morning light,--for thy
name is joy.
Lead me in the centre of thy silence to fill my heart with songs.
Let them live who choose in their own hissing world of fireworks.
My heart longs for thy stars, my God.
Love's pain sang round my life like the unplumbed sea, and love's
joy sang like birds in its flowering groves.
Put out the lamp when thou wishest.
I shall know thy darkness and shall love it.
When I stand before thee at the day's end thou shalt see my scars
and know that I had my wounds and also my healing.
Some day I shall sing to thee in the sunrise of some other world,
"I have seen thee before in the light of the earth, in the love
of man."
Clouds come floating into my life from other days no longer to
shed rain or usher storm but to give colour to my sunset sky.
Truth raises against itself the storm that scatters its seeds
broadcast.
The storm of the last night has crowned this morning with golden
peace.
Truth seems to come with its final word; and the final word gives
birth to its next.
Blessed is he whose fame does not outshine his truth.
Sweetness of thy name fills my heart when I forget mine--like thy
morning sun when the mist is melted.
The silent night has the beauty of the mother and the clamorous
day of the child.
The world loved man when he smiled.  The world became afraid of
him when he laughed.
God waits for man to regain his childhood in wisdom.
Let me feel this world as thy love taking form, then my love will
help it.
Thy sunshine smiles upon the winter days of my heart, never
doubting of its spring flowers.
God kisses the finite in his love and man the infinite.
Thou crossest desert lands of barren years to reach the moment of
fulfilment.
God's silence ripens man's thoughts into speech.
Thou wilt find, Eternal Traveller, marks of thy footsteps across
my songs.
Let me not shame thee, Father, who displayest thy glory in thy
children.
Cheerless is the day, the light under frowning clouds is like a
punished child with traces of tears on its pale cheeks, and the
cry of the wind is like the cry of a wounded world.  But I know I
am travelling to meet my Friend.
To-night there is a stir among the palm leaves, a swell in the
sea, Full Moon, like the heart throb of the world.  From what
unknown sky hast thou carried in thy silence the aching secret of
love?
I dream of a star, an island of light, where I shall be born and
in the depth of its quickening leisure my life will ripen its
works like the ricefield in the autumn sun.
The smell of the wet earth in the rain rises like a great chant
of praise from the voiceless multitude of the insignificant.
That love can ever lose is a fact that we cannot accept as truth.
We shall know some day that death can never rob us of that which
our soul has gained, for her gains are one with herself.
God comes to me in the dusk of my evening with the flowers from
my past kept fresh in his basket.
When all the strings of my life will be tuned, my Master, then at
every touch of thine will come out the music of love.
Let me live truly, my Lord, so that death to me become true.
Man's history is waiting in patience for the triumph of the
insulted man.
I feel thy gaze upon my heart this moment like the sunny silence
of the morning upon the lonely field whose harvest is over.
I long for the Island of Songs across this heaving Sea of Shouts.
The prelude of the night is commenced in the music of the sunset,
in its solemn hymn to the ineffable dark.
I have scaled the peak and found no shelter in fame's bleak and
barren height.  Lead me, my Guide, before the light fades, into
the valley of quiet where life's harvest mellows into golden
wisdom.
Things look phantastic in this dimness of the dusk--the spires
whose bases are lost in the dark and tree tops like blots of ink.
I shall wait for the morning and wake up to see thy city in the
light.
I have suffered and despaired and known death and I am glad that
I am in this great world.
There are tracts in my life that are bare and silent.  They are
the open spaces where my busy days had their light and air.
Release me from my unfulfilled past clinging to me from behind
making death difficult.
Let this be my last word, that I trust in thy love.
I swayed upon the gaudy stern
  The butt end of a steering oar,
  And everywhere that I could turn
  Men ran upon the shore
  And though I would have hushed the crowd
  There was no mother's son but said,
  "What is the figure in a shroud
  Upon a gaudy bed
  And fishes bubbling to the brim
  Cried out upon that thing beneath,
  It had such dignity of limb,
  By the sweet name of Death
  Though I'd my finger on my lip,
  What could I but take up the song?
  And fish and crowd and gaudy ship
  Cried out the whole night long
  Crying amid the glittering sea,
  Naming it with ecstatic breath,
  Because it had such dignity
  By the sweet name of Death
  If any man drew near
  When I was young,
  I thought, "He holds her dear,"
  And shook with hate and fear.
  But oh, 'twas bitter wrong
  If he could pass her by
  With an indifferent eye
  Whereon I wrote and wrought,
  And now, being gray,
  I dream that I have brought
  To such a pitch my thought
  That coming time can say,
  "He shadowed in a glass
  What thing her body was
  For she had fiery blood
  When I was young,
  And trod so sweetly proud
  As 'twere upon a cloud,
  A woman Homer sung,
  That life and letters seem
  But an heroic dream
  She lived in storm and strife.
  Her soul had such desire
  For what proud death may bring
  That it could not endure
  The common good of life,
  But lived as 'twere a king
  That packed his marriage day
  With banneret and pennon,
  Trumpet and kettledrum,
  And the outrageous cannon,
  To bundle Time away
  That the night come
  I had this thought awhile ago,
  "My darling cannot understand
  What I have done, or what would do
  In this blind bitter land
  And I grew weary of the sun
  Until my thoughts cleared up again,
  Remembering that the best I have done
  Was done to make it plain
  That every year I have cried, "At length
  My darling understands it all,
  Because I have come into my strength,
  And words obey my call
  That had she done so who can say
  What would have shaken from the sieve?
  I might have thrown poor words away
  And been content to live
  Now must I these three praise--
  Three women that have wrought
  What joy is in my days;
  One that no passing thought,
  Nor those unpassing cares,
  No, not in these fifteen
  Many times troubled years,
  Could ever come between
  Heart and delighted heart;
  And one because her hand
  Had strength that could unbind
  What none can understand,
  What none can have and thrive,
  Youth's dreamy load, till she
  So changed me that I live
  Labouring in ecstasy.
  And what of her that took
  All till my youth was gone
  With scarce a pitying look?
  How should I praise that one?
  When day begins to break
  I count my good and bad,
  Being wakeful for her sake,
  Remembering what she had,
  What eagle look still shows,
  While up from my heart's root
  So great a sweetness flows
  I shake from head to foot
  Why should I blame her that she filled my days
  With misery, or that she would of late
  Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
  Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
  Had they but courage equal to desire?
  What could have made her peaceful with a mind
  That nobleness made simple as a fire,
  With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
  That is not natural in an age like this,
  Being high and solitary and most stern?
  Why, what could she have done being what she is?
  Was there another Troy for her to burn
  Some may have blamed you that you took away
  The verses that could move them on the day
  When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind
  With lightning you went from me, and I could find
  Nothing to make a song about but kings,
  Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things
  That were like memories of you--but now
  We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;
  And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,
  Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.
  But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,
  My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone
  "Would it were anything but merely voice!"
  The No King cried who after that was King,
  Because he had not heard of anything
  That balanced with a word is more than noise;
  Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
  Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
  Though he'd but cannon--Whereas we that had thought
  To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
  Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
  In momentary anger long ago;
  And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
  That in the blinding light beyond the grave
  We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?
  The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,
  The habitual content of each with each
  When neither soul nor body has been crossed
  Suddenly I saw the cold and rook delighting Heaven
  That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,
  And thereupon imagination and heart were driven
  So wild, that every casual thought of that and this
  Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season
  With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;
  And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,
  Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,
  Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,
  Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent
  Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken
  By the injustice of the skies for punishment
  Ah, that Time could touch a form
  That could show what Homer's age
  Bred to be a hero's wage.
  "Were not all her life but storm,
  Would not painters paint a form
  Of such noble lines" I said.
  "Such a delicate high head,
  So much sternness and such charm,
  Till they had changed us to like strength?"
  Ah, but peace that comes at length,
  Came when Time had touched her form
  O heart, be at peace, because
  Nor knave nor dolt can break
  What's not for their applause,
  Being for a woman's sake.
  Enough if the work has seemed,
  So did she your strength renew,
  A dream that a lion had dreamed
  Till the wilderness cried aloud,
  A secret between you two,
  Between the proud and the proud
  What, still you would have their praise!
  But here's a haughtier text,
  The labyrinth of her days
  That her own strangeness perplexed;
  And how what her dreaming gave
  Earned slander, ingratitude,
  From self-same dolt and knave;
  Aye, and worse wrong than these.
  Yet she, singing upon her road,
  Half lion, half child, is at peace
  The fascination of what's difficult
  Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
  Spontaneous joy and natural content
  Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt
  That must, as if it had not holy blood,
  Nor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
  Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
  As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays
  That have to be set up in fifty ways,
  On the day's war with every knave and dolt,
  Theatre business, management of men.
  I swear before the dawn comes round again
  I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt
  Wine comes in at the mouth
  And love comes in at the eye;
  That's all we shall know for truth
  Before we grow old and die.
  I lift the glass to my mouth,
  I look at you, and I sigh
  Though leaves are many, the root is one;
  Through all the lying days of my youth
  I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;
  Now I may wither into the truth
  Where, where but here have Pride and Truth,
  That long to give themselves for wage,
  To shake their wicked sides at youth
  Restraining reckless middle-age
  You say, as I have often given tongue
  In praise of what another's said or sung,
  'Twere politic to do the like by these;
  But where's the wild dog that has praised his fleas
  Once, when midnight smote the air,
  Eunuchs ran through Hell and met
  Round about Hell's gate, to stare
  At great Juan riding by,
  And like these to rail and sweat,
  Maddened by that sinewy thigh
  "Put off that mask of burning gold
  With emerald eyes."
  "O no, my dear, you make so bold
  To find if hearts be wild and wise,
  And yet not cold
  "I would but find what's there to find,
  Love or deceit."
  "It was the mask engaged your mind,
  And after set your heart to beat,
  Not what's behind
  "But lest you are my enemy,
  I must enquire."
  "O no, my dear, let all that be,
  What matter, so there is but fire
  In you, in me
  How should the world be luckier if this house,
  Where passion and precision have been one
  Time out of mind, became too ruinous
  To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?
  And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
  Where wings have memory of wings, and all
  That comes of the best knit to the best? Although
  Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,
  How should their luck run high enough to reach
  The gifts that govern men, and after these
  To gradual Time's last gift, a written speech
  Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease
_Imitated from Ronsard_
  Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.
  When we are high and airy hundreds say
  That if we hold that flight they'll leave the place,
  While those same hundreds mock another day
  Because we have made our art of common things,
  So bitterly, you'd dream they longed to look
  All their lives through into some drift of wings.
  You've dandled them and fed them from the book
  And know them to the bone; impart to us--
  We'll keep the secret--a new trick to please.
  Is there a bridle for this Proteus
  That turns and changes like his draughty seas?
  Or is there none, most popular of men,
  But when they mock us that we mock again
  These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
  The majesty that shuts his burning eye;
  The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,
  Till that be tumbled that was lifted high
  And discord follow upon unison,
  And all things at one common level lie.
  And therefore, friend, if your great race were run
  And these things came, so much the more thereby
  Have you made greatness your companion,
  Although it be for children that you sigh:
  These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
  The majesty that shuts his burning eye
  Out yonder, where the race course is,
  Delight makes all of the one mind,
  Riders upon the swift horses,
  The field that closes in behind:
  We, too, had good attendance once,
  Hearers and hearteners of the work;
  Aye, horsemen for companions,
  Before the merchant and the clerk
  Breathed on the world with timid breath.
  Sing on: sometime, and at some new moon,
  We'll learn that sleeping is not death,
  Hearing the whole earth change its tune,
  Its flesh being wild, and it again
  Crying aloud as the race course is,
  And we find hearteners among men
  That ride upon horses
  Sickness brought me this
  Thought, in that scale of his:
  Why should I be dismayed
  Though flame had burned the whole
  World, as it were a coal,
  Now I have seen it weighed
  Against a soul
  All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
  One time it was a woman's face, or worse--
  The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
  Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
  Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
  I had not given a penny for a song
  Did not the poet sing it with such airs
  That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
  Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
  Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish
  I whispered, "I am too young,"
  And then, "I am old enough,"
  Wherefore I threw a penny
  To find out if I might love;
  "Go and love, go and love, young man,
  If the lady be young and fair,"
  Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
  I am looped in the loops of her hair
  Oh love is the crooked thing,
  There is nobody wise enough
  To find out all that is in it,
  For he would be thinking of love
  Till the stars had run away,
  And the shadows eaten the moon;
  Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
If some small savor creep into my rhyme
  Of the old poets, if some words I use,
  Neglected long, which have the lusty thews
  Of that gold-haired and earnest-hearted time,
  Whose loving joy and sorrow all sublime
  Have given our tongue its starry eminence,--
  It is not pride, God knows, but reverence
  Which hath grown in me since my childhood's prime;
  Wherein I feel that my poor lyre is strung
  With soul-strings like to theirs, and that I have
  No right to muse their holy graves among,
  If I can be a custom-fettered slave,
  And, in mine own true spirit, am not brave
  To speak what rusheth upward to my tongue
  Then Thorstein looked at Hakon, where he sate,
  Mute as a cloud amid the stormy hall,
  And said: "O, Skald, sing now an olden song,
  Such as our fathers heard who led great lives;
  And, as the bravest on a shield is borne
  Along the waving host that shouts him king,
  So rode their thrones upon the thronging seas
  Then the old man arose: white-haired he stood,
  White-bearded, and with eyes that looked afar
  From their still region of perpetual snow,
  Over the little smokes and stirs of men:
  His head was bowed with gathered flakes of years,
  As winter bends the sea-foreboding pine,
  But something triumphed in his brow and eye,
  Which whoso saw it, could not see and crouch:
  Loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused,
  Brooding his eyried thoughts; then, as an eagle
  Circles smooth-winged above the wind-vexed woods,
  So wheeled his soul into the air of song
  High o'er the stormy hall; and thus he sang
  "The fletcher for his arrow-shaft picks out
  Wood closest-grained, long-seasoned, straight as light;
  And, from a quiver full of such as these,
  The wary bow-man, matched against his peers,
  Long doubting, singles yet once more the best.
  Who is it that can make such shafts as Fate?
  What archer of his arrows is so choice,
  Or hits the white so surely? They are men,
  The chosen of her quiver; nor for her
  Will every reed suffice, or cross-grained stick
  At random from life's vulgar fagot plucked:
  Such answer household ends; but she will have
  Souls straight and clear, of toughest fibre, sound
  Down to the heart of heart; from these she strips
  All needless stuff, all sapwood, hardens them,
  From circumstance untoward feathers plucks
  Crumpled and cheap, and barbs with iron will:
  The hour that passes is her quiver-boy;
  When she draws bow, 'tis not across the wind,
  Nor 'gainst the sun, her haste-snatched arrow sings,
  For sun and wind have plighted faith to her:
  Ere men have heard the sinew twang, behold,
  In the butt's heart her trembling messenger
  "The song is old and simple that I sing:
  Good were the days of yore, when men were tried
  By ring of shields, as now by ring of gold;
  But, while the gods are left, and hearts of men,
  And the free ocean, still the days are good;
  Through the broad Earth roams Opportunity
  And knocks at every door of hut or hall,
  Until she finds the brave soul that she wants
  He ceased, and instantly the frothy tide
  Of interrupted wassail roared along;
  But Leif, the son of Eric, sate apart
  Musing, and, with his eyes upon the fire,
  Saw shapes of arrows, lost as soon as seen;
  But then with that resolve his heart was bent,
  Which, like a humming shaft, through many a strife
  Of day and night across the unventured seas,
  Shot the brave prow to cut on Vinland sands
  The first rune in the Saga of the West
  'Tis good to be abroad in the sun,
  His gifts abide when day is done;
  Each thing in nature from his cup
  Gathers a several virtue up;
  The grace within its being's reach
  Becomes the nutriment of each,
  And the same life imbibed by all
  Makes each most individual:
  Here the twig-bending peaches seek
  The glow that mantles in their cheek--
  Hence comes the Indian-summer bloom
  That hazes round the basking plum,
  And, from the same impartial light,
  The grass sucks green, the lily white
  Like these the soul, for sunshine made,
  Grows wan and gracile in the shade,
  Her faculties, which God decreed
  Various as Summer's dÃ¦dal breed,
  With one sad color are imbued,
  Shut from the sun that tints their blood;
  The shadow of the poet's roof
  Deadens the dyes of warp and woof;
  Whate'er of ancient song remains
  Has fresh air flowing in its veins,
  For Greece and eldest Ind knew well
  That out of doors, with world-wide swell
  Arches the student's lawful cell
  Away, unfruitful lore of books,
  For whose vain idiom we reject
  The spirit's mother-dialect,
  Aliens among the birds and brooks,
  Dull to interpret or believe
  What gospels lost the woods retrieve,
  Or what the eaves-dropping violet
  Reports from God, who walketh yet
  His garden in the hush of eve!
  Away, ye pedants city-bred,
  Unwise of heart, too wise of head,
  Who handcuff Art with _thus and so_,
  And in each other's footprints tread,
  Like those who walk through drifted snow
  Who, from deep study of brick walls
  Conjecture of the water-falls,
  By six square feet of smoke-stained sky
  Compute those deeps that overlie
  The still tarn's heaven-anointed eye,
  And, in your earthen crucible,
  With chemic tests essay to spell
  How nature works in field and dell!
  Seek we where Shakspeare buried gold?
  Such hands no charmed witch-hazel hold;
  To beach and rock repeats the sea
  The mystic _Open Sesame_;
  Old Greylock's voices not in vain
  Comment on Milton's mountain strain,
  And cunningly the various wind
  Spenser's locked music can unbind
  In the twilight deep and silent
  Comes thy spirit unto mine,
  When the moonlight and the starlight
  Over cliff and woodland shine,
  And the quiver of the river
  Seems a thrill of joy benign
  Then I rise and wander slowly
  To the headland by the sea,
  When the evening star throbs setting
  Through the cloudy cedar tree,
  And from under, mellow thunder
  Of the surf comes fitfully
  Then within my soul I feel thee
  Like a gleam of other years,
  Visions of my childhood murmur
  Their old madness in my ears,
  Till the pleasance of thy presence
  Cools my heart with blissful tears
  All the wondrous dreams of boyhood--
  All youth's fiery thirst of praise--
  All the surer hopes of manhood
  Blossoming in sadder days--
  Joys that bound me, griefs that crowned me
  With a better wreath than bays
  All the longings after freedom--
  The vague love of human kind,
  Wandering far and near at random
  Like a winged seed in the wind--
  The dim yearnings and fierce burnings
  Of an undirected mind
  All of these, oh best belovÃ¨d,
  Happiest present dreams and past,
  In thy love find safe fulfilment,
  Ripened into truths at last;
  Faith and beauty, hope and duty
  To one centre gather fast
  How my nature, like an ocean,
  At the breath of thine awakes,
  Leaps its shores in mad exulting
  And in foamy thunder breaks,
  Then downsinking, lieth shrinking
  At the tumult that it makes
  Blazing Hesperus hath sunken
  Low within the pale-blue west,
  And with golden splendor crowneth
  The horizon's piny crest;
  Thoughtful quiet stills the riot
  Of wild longing in my breast
  Home I loiter through the moonlight,
  Underneath the quivering trees,
  Which, as if a spirit stirred them,
  Sway and bend, till by degrees
  The far surge's murmur merges
  In the rustle of the breeze
  There is not in this life of ours
    One bliss unmixed with fears,
  The hope that wakes our deepest powers
    A face of sadness wears,
  And the dew that showers our dearest flowers
    Is the bitter dew of tears
  Fame waiteth long, and lingereth
    Through weary nights and morns--
  And evermore the shadow Death
    With mocking finger scorns
  That underneath the laurel wreath
    Should be a wreath of thorns
  The laurel leaves are cool and green,
    But the thorns are hot and sharp,
  Lean Hunger grins and stares between
    The poet and his harp;
  Though of Love's sunny sheen his woof have been,
    Grim want thrusts in the warp
  And if beyond this darksome clime
    Some fair star Hope may see,
  That keeps unjarred the blissful chime
    Of its golden infancy--
  Where the harvest-time of faith sublime
    Not always is to be
  Yet would the true soul rather choose
    Its home where sorrow is,
  Than in a sated peace to lose
    Its life's supremest bliss--
  The rainbow hues that bend profuse
    O'er cloudy spheres like this
  The want, the sorrow and the pain,
    That are Love's right to cure--
  The sunshine bursting after rain--
    The gladness insecure
  That makes us fain strong hearts to gain,
    To do and to endure
  High natures must be thunder-scarred
    With many a searing wrong;
  From mother Sorrow's breasts the bard
    Sucks gifts of deepest song,
  Nor all unmarred with struggles hard
    Wax the Soul's sinews strong
  Dear Patience, too, is born of woe,
    Patience that opes the gate
  Wherethrough the soul of man must go
    Up to each nobler state,
  Whose voice's flow so meek and low
    Smooths the bent brows of Fate
  Though Fame be slow, yet Death is swift,
    And, o'er the spirit's eyes,
  Life after life doth change and shift
    With larger destinies:
  As on we drift, some wider rift
    Shows us serener skies
  And though naught falleth to us here
    But gains the world counts loss,
  Though all we hope of wisdom clear
    When climbed to seems but dross,
  Yet all, though ne'er Christ's faith they wear,
    At least may share his cross
  Farewell! as the bee round the blossom
  Doth murmur drowsily,
  So murmureth round my bosom
  The memory of thee;
  Lingering, it seems to go,
  When the wind more full doth flow,
  Waving the flower to and fro,
  But still returneth, Marian
  My hope no longer burneth,
  Which did so fiercely burn,
  My joy to sorrow turneth,
  Although loath, loath to turn--
  I would forget--
  And yet--and yet
  My heart to thee still yearneth, Marian
  Fair as a single star thou shinest,
  And white as lilies are
  The slender hands wherewith thou twinest
  Thy heavy auburn hair;
  Thou art to me
  A memory
  Of all that is divinest:
  Thou art so fair and tall,
  Thy looks so queenly are,
  Thy very shadow on the wall,
  Thy step upon the stair,
  The thought that thou art nigh,
  The chance look of thine eye
  Are more to me than all, Marian,
  And will be till I die
  As the last quiver of a bell
  Doth fade into the air,
  With a subsiding swell
  That dies we know not where,
  So my hope melted and was gone:
  I raised mine eyes to bless the star
  That shared its light with me so far
  Below its silver throne,
  And gloom and chilling vacancy
  Were all was left to me,
  In the dark, bleak night I was alone!
  Alone in the blessed Earth, Marian,
  For what were all to me--
  Its love, and light, and mirth, Marian,
  If I were not with thee
  My heart will not forget thee
  More than the moaning brine
  Forgets the moon when she is set;
  The gush when first I met thee
  That thrilled my brain like wine,
  Doth thrill as madly yet;
  My heart cannot forget thee,
  Though it may droop and pine,
  Too deeply it had set thee
  In every love of mine;
  No new moon ever cometh,
  No flower ever bloometh,
  No twilight ever gloometh
  But I'm more only thine.
  Oh look not on me, Marian,
  Thine eyes are wild and deep,
  And they have won me, Marian,
  From peacefulness and sleep;
  The sunlight doth not sun me,
  The meek moonshine doth shun me,
  All sweetest voices stun me--
  There is no rest
  Within my breast
  And I can only weep, Marian
  As a landbird far at sea
  Doth wander through the sleet
  And drooping downward wearily
  Finds no rest for her feet,
  So wandereth my memory
  O'er the years when we did meet:
  I used to say that everything
  Partook a share of thee,
  That not a little bird could sing,
  Or green leaf flutter on a tree,
  That nothing could be beautiful
  Save part of thee were there,
  That from thy soul so clear and full
  All bright and blessÃ¨d things did cull
  The charm to make them fair;
  And now I know
  That it was so,
  Thy spirit through the earth doth flow
  And face me wheresoe'er I go--
  What right hath perfectness to give
  Such weary weight of woe
  Unto the soul which cannot live
  On anything more low?
  Oh leave me, leave me, Marian,
  There's no fair thing I see
  But doth deceive me, Marian,
  Into sad dreams of thee
  A cold snake gnaws my heart
  And crushes round my brain,
  And I should glory but to part
  So bitterly again,
  Feeling the slow tears start
  And fall in fiery rain:
  There's a wide ring round the moon,
  The ghost-like clouds glide by,
  And I hear the sad winds croon
  A dirge to the lowering sky;
  There's nothing soft or mild
  In the pale moon's sickly light,
  But all looks strange and wild
  Through the dim, foreboding night:
  I think thou must be dead
  In some dark and lonely place,
  With candles at thy head,
  And a pall above thee spread
  To hide thy dead, cold face;
  But I can see thee underneath
  So pale, and still, and fair,
  Thine eyes closed smoothly and a wreath
  Of flowers in thy hair;
  I never saw thy face so clear
  When thou wast with the living,
  As now beneath the pall, so drear,
  And stiff, and unforgiving;
  I cannot flee thee, Marian,
  I cannot turn away,
  Mine eyes must see thee, Marian,
  Through salt tears night and day
  Poet! lonely is thy bed,
  And the turf is overhead--
    Cold earth is thy cover;
  But thy heart hath found release,
  And it slumbers full of peace
  'Neath the rustle of green trees
  And the warm hum of the bees,
    Mid the drowsy clover;
  Through thy chamber, still as death,
  A smooth gurgle wandereth,
  As the blue stream murmureth
    To the blue sky over.
  Three paces from the silver strand,
  Gently in the fine, white sand,
  With a lily in thy hand,
    Pale as snow, they laid thee;
  In no coarse earth wast thou hid,
  And no gloomy coffin-lid
    Darkly overweighed thee.
  Silently as snow-flakes drift,
  The smooth sand did sift and sift
    O'er the bed they made thee;
  All sweet birds did come and sing
  At thy sunny burying--
  Choristers unbidden,
  And, beloved of sun and dew,
  Meek forget-me-nots upgrew
  Where thine eyes so large and blue
   'Neath the turf were hidden
  Where thy stainless clay doth lie,
  Blue and open is the sky,
  And the white clouds wander by,
  Dreams of summer silently
    Darkening the river;
  Thou hearest the clear water run;
  And the ripples every one,
  Scattering the golden sun,
    Through thy silence quiver;
  Vines trail down upon the stream,
  Into its smooth and glassy dream
    A green stillness spreading,
  And the shiner, perch, and bream
  Through the shadowed waters gleam
   'Gainst the current heading
  White as snow, thy winding sheet
  Shelters thee from head to feet,
    Save thy pale face only;
  Thy face is turned toward the skies,
  The lids lie meekly o'er thine eyes,
  And the low-voiced pine-tree sighs
    O'er thy bed so lonely.
  All thy life thou lov'dst its shade:
  Underneath it thou art laid,
    In an endless shelter;
  Thou hearest it forever sigh
  As the wind's vague longings die
  In its branches dim and high--
  Thou hear'st the waters gliding by
    Slumberously welter
  Thou wast full of love and truth,
  Of forgiveness and ruth--
  Thy great heart with hope and youth
    Tided to o'erflowing.
  Thou didst dwell in mysteries,
  And there lingered on thine eyes
  Shadows of serener skies,
  Awfully wild memories,
    That were like foreknowing;
  Through the earth thou would'st have gone,
  Lighted from within alone,
  Seeds from flowers in Heaven grown
    With a free hand sowing
  Thou didst remember well and long
  Some fragments of thine angel-song,
  And strive, through want of woe and wrong,
    To win the world unto it;
  Thy sin it was to see and hear
  Beyond To-day's dim hemisphere--
  Beyond all mists of hope and fear,
  Into a life more true and clear,
    And dearly thou didst rue it;
  Light of the new world thou hadst won,
  O'erflooded by a purer sun--
  Slowly Fate's ship came drifting on,
  And through the dark, save thou, not one
    Caught of the land a token.
  Thou stood'st upon the farthest prow,
  Something within thy soul said "Now!"
  And leaping forth with eager brow,
    Thou fell'st on shore heart-broken
  Long time thy brethren stood in fear;
  Only the breakers far and near,
  White with their anger, they could hear;
  The sounds of land, which thy quick ear
    Caught long ago, they heard not.
  And, when at last they reached the strand,
  They found thee lying on the sand
  With some wild flowers in thy hand,
    But thy cold bosom stirred not;
  They listened, but they heard no sound
  Save from the glad life all around
    A low, contented murmur.
  The long grass flowed adown the hill,
  A hum rose from a hidden rill,
  But thy glad heart, that knew no ill
  But too much love, lay dead and still--
  The only thing that sent a chill
    Into the heart of summer
  Thou didst not seek the poet's wreath
    But too soon didst win it;
  Without 'twas green, but underneath
  Were scorn and loneliness and death,
  Gnawing the brain with burning teeth,
    And making mock within it.
  Thou, who wast full of nobleness,
  Whose very life-blood 'twas to bless,
    Whose soul's one law was giving,
  Must bandy words with wickedness,
  Haggle with hunger and distress,
  To win that death which worldliness
    Calls bitterly a living
  "Thou sow'st no gold, and shalt not reap!"
  Muttered earth, turning in her sleep;
  "Come home to the Eternal Deep!"
  Murmured a voice, and a wide sweep
  Of wings through thy soul's hush did creep,
    As of thy doom o'erflying;
  It seem'd that thy strong heart would leap
  Out of thy breast, and thou didst weep,
    But not with fear of dying;
  Men could not fathom thy deep fears,
  They could not understand thy tears,
  The hoarded agony of years
    Of bitter self-denying.
  So once, when high above the spheres
  Thy spirit sought its starry peers,
  It came not back to face the jeers
    Of brothers who denied it;
  Star-crowned, thou dost possess the deeps
  Of God, and thy white body sleeps
  Where the lone pine forever keeps
    Patient watch beside it
  Poet! underneath the turf,
    Soft thou sleepest, free from morrow,
  Thou hast struggled through the surf
    Of wild thoughts and want and sorrow.
  Now, beneath the moaning pine,
    Full of rest, thy body lieth,
  While far up is clear sunshine,
  Underneath a sky divine,
    Her loosed wings thy spirit trieth;
  Oft she strove to spread them here,
  But they were too white and clear
  For our dingy atmosphere
  Thy body findeth ample room
  In its still and grassy tomb
    By the silent river;
  But thy spirit found the earth
  Narrow for the mighty birth
    Which it dreamed of ever;
  Thou wast guilty of a rhyme
  Learned in a benigner clime,
  And of that more grievous crime,
  An ideal too sublime
  For the low-hung sky of Time
  The calm spot where thy body lies
  Gladdens thy soul in Paradise,
    It is so still and holy;
  Thy body sleeps serenely there,
  And well for it thy soul may care,
  It was so beautiful and fair,
    Lily white so wholly.
  From so pure and sweet a frame
  Thy spirit parted as it came,
    Gentle as a maiden;
  Now it lieth full of rest--
  Sods are lighter on its breast
  Than the great, prophetic guest
    Wherewith it was laden
  Who prest you here? The Past can tell,
    When summer skies were bright above,
  And some full heart did leap and swell
    Beneath the white new moon of love
  Some Poet, haply, when the world
    Showed like a calm sea, grand and blue,
  Ere its cold, inky waves had curled
    O'er the numb heart once warm and true
  When, with his soul brimful of morn,
    He looked beyond the vale of Time,
  Nor saw therein the dullard scorn
    That made his heavenliness a crime
  When, musing o'er the Poets olden,
    His soul did like a sun upstart
  To shoot its arrows, clear and golden,
    Through slavery's cold and darksome heart
  Alas! too soon the veil is lifted
    That hangs between the soul and pain,
  Too soon the morning-red hath drifted
    Into dull cloud, or fallen in rain
  Or were you prest by one who nurst
    Bleak memories of love gone by,
  Whose heart, like a star fallen, burst
    In dark and erring vacancy
  To him you still were fresh and green
    As when you grew upon the stalk,
  And many a breezy summer scene
    Came back--and many a moonlit walk
  And there would be a hum of bees,
    A smell of childhood in the air,
  And old, fresh feelings cooled the breeze
    That, like loved fingers, stirred his hair
  Then would you suddenly be blasted
    By the keen wind of one dark thought,
  One nameless woe, that had outlasted
    The sudden blow whereby 'twas brought
  Or were you prest here by two lovers
    Who seemed to read these verses rare,
  But found between the antique covers
    What Spenser could not prison there
  Songs which his glorious soul had heard,
    But his dull pen could never write,
  Which flew, like some gold-wingÃ¨d bird,
    Through the blue heaven out of sight
  My heart is with them as they sit,
    I see the rosebud in her breast,
  I see her small hand taking it
    From out its odorous, snowy nest
  I hear him swear that he will keep it,
    In memory of that blessed day,
  To smile on it or over-weep it
    When she and spring are far away
  Ah me! I needs must droop my head,
    And brush away a happy tear,
  For they are gone, and, dry and dead,
    The rosebud lies before me here
  Yet is it in no stranger's hand,
    For I will guard it tenderly,
  And it shall be a magic wand
    To bring mine own true love to me
  My heart runs o'er with sweet surmises,
  The while my fancy weaves her rhyme,
  Kind hopes and musical surprises
  Throng round me from the olden time
  I do not care to know who prest you:
  Enough for me to feel and know
  That some heart's love and longing blest you,
  Knitting to-day with long-ago
  The night is calm and beautiful; the snow
  Sparkles beneath the clear and frosty moon
  And the cold stars, as if it took delight
  In its own silent whiteness; the hushed earth
  Sleeps in the soft arms of the embracing blue,
  Secure as if angelic squadrons yet
  Encamped about her, and each watching star
  Gained double brightness from the flashing arms
  Of wingÃ¨d and unsleeping sentinels.
  Upward the calm of infinite silence deepens,
  The sea that flows between high heaven and earth,
  Musing by whose smooth brink we sometimes find
  A stray leaf floated from those happier shores,
  And hope, perchance not vainly, that some flower
  Which we had watered with our holiest tears,
  Pale blooms, and yet our scanty garden's best,
  O'er the same ocean piloted by love,
  May find a haven at the feet of God,
  And be not wholly worthless in his sight.
  O, high dependence on a higher Power,
  Sole stay for all these restless faculties
  That wander, Ishmael-like, the desert bare
  Wherein our human knowledge hath its home,
  Shifting their light-framed tents from day to day,
  With each new-found oasis, wearied soon,
  And only certain of uncertainty!
  O, mighty humbleness that feels with awe,
  Yet with a vast exulting feels, no less,
  That this huge Minster of the Universe,
  Whose smallest oratories are glorious worlds,
  With painted oriels of dawn and sunset;
  Whose carvÃ¨d ornaments are systems grand,
  Orion kneeling in his starry niche,
  The Lyre whose strings give music audible
  To holy ears, and countless splendors more,
  Crowned by the blazing Cross high-hung o'er all;
  Whose organ music is the solemn stops
  Of endless Change breathed through by endless Good;
  Whose choristers are all the morning stars;
  Whose altar is the sacred human heart
  Whereon Love's candles burn unquenchably,
  Trimmed day and night by gentle-handed Peace;
  With all its arches and its pinnacles
  That stretch forever and forever up,
  Is founded on the silent heart of God,
  Silent, yet pulsing forth exhaustless life
  Through the least veins of all created things.
  Fit musings these for the departing year;
  And God be thanked for such a crystal night
  As fills the spirit with good store of thoughts,
  That, like a cheering fire of walnut, crackle
  Upon the hearthstone of the heart, and cast
  A mild home-glow o'er all Humanity!
  Yes, though the poisoned shafts of evil doubts
  Assail the skyey panoply of Faith,
  Though the great hopes which we have had for man,
  Foes in disguise, because they based belief
  On man's endeavor, not on God's decree--
  Though these proud-visaged hopes, once turned to fly,
  Hurl backward many a deadly Parthian dart
  That rankles in the soul and makes it sick
  With vain regret, nigh verging on despair--
  Yet, in such calm and earnest hours as this,
  We well can feel how every living heart
  That sleeps to-night in palace or in cot,
  Or unroofed hovel, or which need hath known
  Of other homestead than the arching sky,
  Is circled watchfully with seraph fires;
  How our own erring will it is that hangs
  The flaming sword o'er Eden's unclosed gate,
  Which gives free entrance to the pure in heart,
  And with its guarding walls doth fence the meek.
  Sleep then, O Earth, in thy blue-vaulted cradle,
  Bent over always by thy mother Heaven!
  We all are tall enough to reach God's hand,
  And angels are no taller: looking back
  Upon the smooth wake of a year o'erpast,
  We see the black clouds furling, one by one,
  From the advancing majesty of Truth,
  And something won for Freedom, whose least gain
  Is as a firm and rock-built citadel
  Wherefrom to launch fresh battle on her foes;
  Or, leaning from the time's extremest prow,
  If we gaze forward through the blinding spray,
  And dimly see how much of ill remains,
  How many fetters to be sawn asunder
  By the slow toil of individual zeal,
  Or haply rusted by salt tears in twain,
  We feel, with something of a sadder heart,
  Yet bracing up our bruisÃ¨d mail the while,
  And fronting the old foe with fresher spirit,
  How great it is to breathe with human breath,
  To be but poor foot-soldiers in the ranks
  Of our old exiled king, Humanity;
  Encamping after every hard-won field
  Nearer and nearer Heaven's happy plains
  Many great souls have gone to rest, and sleep
  Under this armor, free and full of peace:
  If these have left the earth, yet Truth remains,
  Endurance, too, the crowning faculty
  Of noble minds, and Love, invincible
  By any weapons; and these hem us round
  With silence such that all the groaning clank
  Of this mad engine men have made of earth
  Dulls not some ears for catching purer tones,
  That wander from the dim surrounding vast,
  Or far more clear melodious prophecies,
  The natural music of the heart of man,
  Which by kind Sorrow's ministry hath learned
  That the true sceptre of all power is love
  And humbleness the palace-gate of truth.
  What man with soul so blind as sees not here
  The first faint tremble of Hope's morning-star,
  Foretelling how the God-forged shafts of dawn,
  Fitted already on their golden string,
  Shall soon leap earthward with exulting flight
  To thrid the dark heart of that evil faith
  Whose trust is in the clumsy arms of Force,
  The ozier hauberk of a ruder age?
  Freedom! thou other name for happy Truth,
  Thou warrior-maid, whose steel-clad feet were never
  Out of the stirrup, nor thy lance uncouched,
  Nor thy fierce eye enticÃ¨d from its watch,
  Thou hast learned now, by hero-blood in vain
  Poured to enrich the soil which tyrants reap;
  By wasted lives of prophets, and of those
  Who, by the promise in their souls upheld,
  Into the red arms of a fiery death
  Went blithely as the golden-girdled bee
  Sinks in the sleepy poppy's cup of flame
  By the long woes of nations set at war,
  That so the swollen torrent of their wrath
  May find a vent, else sweeping off like straws
  The thousand cobweb threads, grown cable-huge
  By time's long gathered dust, but cobwebs still,
  Which bind the Many that the Few may gain
  Leisure to wither by the drought of ease
  What heavenly germs in their own souls were sown;--
  By all these searching lessons thou hast learned
  To throw aside thy blood-stained helm and spear
  And with thy bare brow daunt the enemy's front,
  Knowing that God will make the lily stalk,
  In the soft grasp of naked Gentleness,
  Stronger than iron spear to shatter through
  The sevenfold toughness of Wrong's idle shield
  The sunset scarce had dimmed away
  Into the twilight's doubtful gray;
  One long cloud o'er the horizon lay,
  'Neath which, a streak of bluish white,
  Wavered between the day and night;
  Over the pine trees on the hill
  The trembly evening-star did thrill,
  And the new moon, with slender rim,
  Through the elm arches gleaming dim,
  Filled memory's chalice to the brim
  On such an eve the heart doth grow
  Full of surmise, and scarce can know
  If it be now or long ago,
  Or if indeed it doth exist;--
  A wonderful enchanted mist
  From the new moon doth wander out,
  Wrapping all things in mystic doubt,
  So that this world doth seem untrue,
  And all our fancies to take hue
  From some life ages since gone through
  The maiden sat and heard the flow
  Of the west wind so soft and low
  The leaves scarce quivered to and fro;
  Unbound, her heavy golden hair
  Rippled across her bosom bare,
  Which gleamed with thrilling snowy white
  Far through the magical moonlight:
  The breeze rose with a rustling swell,
  And from afar there came the smell
  Of a long-forgotten lily-bell
  The dim moon rested on the hill,
  But silent, without thought or will,
  Where sat the dreamy maiden still;
  And now the moon's tip, like a star,
  Drew down below the horizon's bar;
  To her black noon the night hath grown,
  Yet still the maiden sits alone,
  Pale as a corpse beneath a stream
  And her white bosom still doth gleam
  Through the deep midnight like a dream
  Cloudless the morning came and fair,
  And lavishly the sun doth share
  His gold among her golden hair,
  Kindling it all, till slowly so
  A glory round her head doth glow;
  A withered flower is in her hand,
  That grew in some far distant land,
  And, silently transfigurÃ¨d,
  With wide calm eyes, and undrooped head,
  They found the stranger-maiden dead
  A youth, that morn, 'neath other skies,
  Felt sudden tears burn in his eyes,
  And his heart throng with memories;
  All things without him seemed to win
  Strange brotherhood with things within,
  And he forever felt that he
  Walked in the midst of mystery,
  And thenceforth, why, he could not tell,
  His heart would curdle at the smell
  Of his once-cherished lily-bell
  Something from him had passed away;
  Some shifting trembles of clear day,
  Through starry crannies in his clay,
  Grew bright and steadfast, more and more,
  Where all had been dull earth before;
  And, through these chinks, like him of old,
  His spirit converse high did hold
  With clearer loves and wider powers,
  That brought him dewy fruits and flowers
  From far Elysian groves and bowers
  Just on the farther bound of sense,
  Unproved by outward evidence,
  But known by a deep influence
  Which through our grosser clay doth shine
  With light unwaning and divine,
  Beyond where highest thought can fly
  Stretcheth the world of Mystery--
  And they not greatly overween
  Who deem that nothing true hath been
  Save the unspeakable Unseen
  One step beyond life's work-day things,
  One more beat of the soul's broad wings,
  One deeper sorrow sometimes brings
  The spirit into that great Vast
  Where neither future is nor past;
  None knoweth how he entered there,
  But, waking, finds his spirit where
  He thought an angel could not soar,
  And, what he called false dreams before,
  The very air about his door
  These outward seemings are but shows
  Whereby the body sees and knows;
  Far down beneath, forever flows
  A stream of subtlest sympathies
  That make our spirits strangely wise
  In awe, and fearful bodings dim
  Which, from the sense's outer rim,
  Stretch forth beyond our thought and sight,
  Fine arteries of circling light,
  Pulsed outward from the Infinite
  Hope first the youthful Poet leads,
  And he is glad to follow her;
  Kind is she, and to all his needs
  With a free hand doth minister
  But, when sweet Hope at last hath fled,
  Cometh her sister, Memory;
  She wreathes Hope's garlands round her head,
  And strives to seem as fair as she
  Then Hope comes back, and by the hand
  She leads a child most fair to see,
  Who with a joyous face doth stand
  Uniting Hope and Memory
  So brighter grew the Earth around,
  And bluer grew the sky above;
  The Poet now his guide hath found,
  And follows in the steps of Love
  The gentle Una I have loved,
  The snowy maiden, pure and mild,
  Since ever by her side I roved,
  Through ventures strange, a wondering child,
  In fantasy a Red Cross Knight,
  Burning for her dear sake to fight
  If there be one who can, like her,
  Make sunshine in life's shady places,
  One in whose holy bosom stir
  As many gentle household graces--
  And such I think there needs must be--
  Will she accept this book from me
    Gentle, Lady, be thy sleeping,
  Peaceful may thy dreamings be,
  While around thy soul is sweeping,
  Dreamy-winged, our melody;
  Chant we, Brothers, sad and slow,
  Let our song be soft and low
  As the voice of other years,
  Let our hearts within us melt,
  To gentleness, as if we felt
  The dropping of our mother's tears
    Lady! now our song is bringing
  Back again thy childhood's hours--
  Hearest thou the humbee singing
  Drowsily among the flowers?
  Sleepily, sleepily
  In the noontide swayeth he,
  Half rested on the slender stalks
  That edge those well-known garden walks;
  Hearest thou the fitful whirring
  Of the humbird's viewless wings--
  Feel'st not round thy heart the stirring
  Of childhood's half-forgotten things
    Seest thou the dear old dwelling
  With the woodbine round the door?
  Brothers, soft! her breast is swelling
  With the busy thoughts of yore;
  Lowly sing ye, sing ye mildly,
  House her spirit not so wildly,
  Lest she sleep not any more.
  'Tis the pleasant summertide,
  Open stands the window wide--
  Whose voices, Lady, art thou drinking?
  Who sings the best belovÃ¨d tune
  In a clear note, rising, sinking,
  Like a thrush's song in June?
  Whose laugh is that which rings so clear
  And joyous in thine eager ear
    Lower, Brothers, yet more low
  Weave the song in mazy twines;
  She heareth now the west wind blow
  At evening through the clump of pines;
  O! mournful is their tune,
  As of a crazÃ¨d thing
  Who, to herself alone,
  Is ever murmuring,
  Through the night and through the day,
  For something that hath passed away.
  Often, Lady, hast thou listened,
  Often have thy blue eyes glistened,
  Where the summer evening breeze
  Moaned sadly through those lonely trees,
  Or with the fierce wind from the north
  Wrung their mournful music forth.
  Ever the river floweth
  In an unbroken stream,
  Ever the west wind bloweth,
  Murmuring as he goeth,
  And mingling with her dream;
  Onward still the river sweepeth
  With a sound of long-agone;
  Lowly, Brothers, lo! she weepeth,
  She is now no more alone;
  Long-loved forms and long-loved faces
  Round about her pillow throng,
  Through her memory's desert places
  Flow the waters of our song.
  Lady! if thy life be holy
  As when thou wert yet a child,
  Though our song be melancholy,
  It will stir no anguish wild;
  For the soul that hath lived well,
  For the soul that child-like is,
  There is quiet in the spell
  That brings back early memories
  Lift up the curtains of thine eyes
    And let their light outshine!
  Let me adore the mysteries
    Of those mild orbs of thine,
  Which ever queenly calm do roll,
  AttunÃ¨d to an ordered soul
  Open thy lips yet once again
    And, while my soul doth hush
  With awe, pour forth that holy strain
    Which seemeth me to gush,
  A fount of music, running o'er
  From thy deep spirit's inmost core
  The melody that dwells in thee
    Begets in me as well
  A spiritual harmony,
    A mild and blessÃ¨d spell;
  Far, far above earth's atmosphere
  I rise, whene'er thy voice I hear
    Not they alone are the departed,
  Who have laid them down to sleep
  In the grave narrow and lonely,
  Not for them only do I vigils keep,
  Not for them only am I heavy-hearted,
  Not for them only
    Many, many, there are many
  Who no more are with me here,
  As cherished, as beloved as any
  Whom I have seen upon the bier.
  I weep to think of those old faces,
  To see them in their grief or mirth;
  I weep--for there are empty places
  Around my heart's once crowded hearth;
  The cold ground doth not cover them,
  The grass hath not grown over them,
  Yet are they gone from me on earth;--
  O! how more bitter is this weeping,
  Than for those lost ones who are sleeping
  Where sun will shine and flowers blow,
  Where gentle winds will whisper low,
  And the stars have them in their keeping!
  Wherefore from me who loved you so,
  O! wherefore did ye go?
  I have shed full many a tear,
  I have wrestled oft in prayer--
  But ye do not come again;
  How could anything so dear,
  How could anything so fair,
  Vanish like the summer rain?
  No, no, it cannot be,
  But ye are still with me
    And yet, O! where art thou,
  Childhood, with sunny brow
  And floating hair?
  Where art thou hiding now?
  I have sought thee everywhere,
  All among the shrubs and flowers
  Of those garden-walks of ours--
  Thou art not there!
  When the shadow of Night's wings
  Hath darkened all the Earth,
  I listen for thy gambolings
  Beside the cheerful hearth--
  Thou art not there!
  I listen to the far-off bell,
  I murmur o'er the little songs
  Which thou didst love so well,
  Pleasant memories come in throngs
  And mine eyes are blurred with tears,
  But no glimpse of thee appears:
  Lonely am I in the Winter, lonely in the Spring,
  Summer and Harvest bring no trace of thee--
  Oh! whither, whither art thou wandering,
  Thou who didst once so cleave to me
    And Love is gone;--
  I have seen him come,
  I have seen him, too, depart,
  Leaving desolate his home,
  His bright home in my heart.
  I am alone!
  Cold, cold is his hearth-stone,
  Wide open stands the door;
  The frolic and the gentle one
  Shall I see no more, no more?
  At the fount the bowl is broken,
  I shall drink it not again,
  All my longing prayers are spoken,
  And felt, ah, woe is me, in vain!
  Oh, childish hopes and childish fancies,
  Whither have ye fled away?
  I long for you in mournful trances,
  I long for you by night and day;
  Beautiful thoughts that once were mine,
  Might I but win you back once more,
  Might ye about my being twine
  And cluster as ye did of yore!
  O! do not let me pray in vain--
  How good and happy I should be,
  How free from every shade of pain,
  If ye would come again to me!
  O, come again! come, come again!
  Hath the sun forgot its brightness,
  Have the stars forgot to shine,
  That they bring not their wonted lightness
  To this weary heart of mine?
  'Tis not the sun that shone on thee,
  Happy childhood, long ago--
  Not the same stars silently
  Looking on the same bright snow--
  Not the same that Love and I
  Together watched in days gone by!
  No, not the same, alas for me
    Would God that those who early went
  To the house dark and low,
  For whom our mourning heads were bent,
  For whom our steps were slow;
  O, would that these alone had left us,
  That Fate of these alone had reft us,
  Would God indeed that it were so!
  Many leaves too soon must wither,
  Many flowers too soon must die,
  Many bright ones wandering hither,
  We know not whence, we know not why,
  Like the leaves and like the flowers,
  Vanish, ere the summer hours,
  That brought them to us, have gone by
    O for the hopes and for the feelings,
  Childhood, that I shared with thee--
  The high resolves, the bright revealings
  Of the soul's might, which thou gav'st me,
  Gentle Love, woe worth the day,
  Woe worth the hour when thou wert born,
  Woe worth the day thou fled'st away--
  A shade across the wind-waved corn--
  A dewdrop falling from the leaves
  Chance-shaken in a summer's morn!
  Woe, woe is me! my sick heart grieves,
  Companionless and anguish-worn!
  I know it well, our manly years
  Must be baptized in bitter tears;
  Full many fountains must run dry
  That youth has dreamed for long hours by,
  Choked by convention's siroc blast
  Or drifting sands of many cares;
  Slowly they leave us all at last,
  And cease their flowing unawares
    Anacreon of the meadow,
  Drunk with the joy of spring!
  Beneath the tall pine's voiceful shadow
  I lie and drink thy jargoning;
  My soul is full with melodies,
  One drop would overflow it,
  And send the tears into mine eyes--
  But what car'st thou to know it?
  Thy heart is free as mountain air,
  And of thy lays thou hast no care,
  Scattering them gayly everywhere,
  Happy, unconscious poet
    Upon a tuft of meadow grass,
  While thy loved-one tends the nest,
  Thou swayest as the breezes pass,
  Unburthening thine o'erfull breast
  Of the crowded songs that fill it,
  Just as joy may choose to will it.
  Lord of thy love and liberty,
  The blithest bird of merry May,
  Thou turnest thy bright eyes on me,
  That say as plain as eye can say--
  "Here sit we, here in the summer weather,
  I and my modest mate together;
  Whatever your wise thoughts may be,
  Under that gloomy old pine tree,
  We do not value them a feather
    Now, leaving earth and me behind,
  Thou beatest up against the wind,
  Or, floating slowly down before it,
  Above thy grass-hid nest thou flutterest
  And thy bridal love-song utterest,
  Raining showers of music o'er it,
  Weary never, still thou trillest,
  Spring-gladsome lays,
  As of moss-rimmed water-brooks
  Murmuring through pebbly nooks
  In quiet summer days.
  My heart with happiness thou fillest,
  I seem again to be a boy
  Watching thee, gay, blithesome lover,
  O'er the bending grass-tops hover,
  Quivering thy wings for joy.
  There's something in the apple-blossom,
  The greening grass and bobolink's song,
  That wakes again within my bosom
  Feelings which have slumbered long.
  As long, long years ago I wandered,
  I seem to wander even yet,
  The hours the idle school-boy squandered,
  The man would die ere he'd forget.
  O hours that frosty eld deemed wasted,
  Nodding his gray head toward my books,
  I dearer prize the lore I tasted
  With you, among the trees and brooks,
  Than all that I have gained since then
  From learnÃ¨d books or study-withered men!
  Nature, thy soul was one with mine,
  And, as a sister by a younger brother
  Is loved, each flowing to the other,
  Such love for me was thine.
  Or wert thou not more like a loving mother
  With sympathy and loving power to heal,
  Against whose heart my throbbing heart I'd lay
  And moan my childish sorrows all away,
  Till calm and holiness would o'er me steal?
  Was not the golden sunset a dear friend?
  Found I no kindness in the silent moon,
  And the green trees, whose tops did sway and bend,
  Low singing evermore their pleasant tune?
  Felt I no heart in dim and solemn woods--
  No loved-one's voice in lonely solitudes?
  Yes, yes! unhoodwinked then my spirit's eyes,
  Blind leaders had not _taught me_ to be wise
    Dear hours! which now again I over-live,
  Hearing and seeing with the ears and eyes
  Of childhood, ye were bees, that to the hive
  Of my young heart came laden with rich prize,
  Gathered in fields and woods and sunny dells, to be
  My spirit's food in days more wintery.
  Yea, yet again ye come! ye come!
  And, like a child once more at home
  After long sojourning in alien climes,
  I lie upon my mother's breast,
  Feeling the blessedness of rest,
  And dwelling in the light of other times
    O ye whose living is not _Life_,
  Whose dying is but death,
  Song, empty toil and petty strife,
  Rounded with loss of breath!
  Go, look on Nature's countenance,
  Drink in the blessing of her glance;
  Look on the sunset, hear the wind,
  The cataract, the awful thunder;
  Go, worship by the sea;
  Then, and then only, shall ye find,
  With ever-growing wonder,
  Man is not all in all to ye;
  Go with a meek and humble soul,
  Then shall the scales of self unroll
  From off your eyes--the weary packs
  Drop from your heavy-laden backs;
  And ye shall see,
  With reverent and hopeful eyes,
  Glowing with new-born energies,
  How great a thing it is to |be
  There's a haven of sure rest
    From the loud world's bewildering stress
  As a bird dreaming on her nest,
  As dew hid in a rose's breast,
  As Hesper in the glowing West;
      So the heart sleeps
      In thy calm deeps,
    Serene Forgetfulness
  No sorrow in that place may be,
    The noise of life grows less and less:
  As moss far down within the sea,
  As, in white lily caves, a bee,
  As life in a hazy reverie;
      So the heart's wave
      In thy dim cave,
    Hushes, Forgetfulness
  Duty and care fade far away
    What toil may be we cannot guess:
  As a ship anchored in the bay,
  As a cloud at summer-noon astray,
  As water-blooms in a breezeless day;
      So,'neath thine eyes,
      The full heart lies,
    And dreams, Forgetfulness
  What reck I of the stars, when I
    May gaze into thine eyes,
  O'er which the brown hair flowingly
    Is parted maidenwise
  From thy pale forehead, calm and bright,
  Over thy cheeks so rosy white
  What care I for the red moon-rise?
    Far liefer would I sit
  And watch the joy within thine eyes
    Gush up at sight of it;
  Thyself my queenly moon shall be,
  Ruling my heart's deep tides for me
  What heed I if the sky be blue?
    So are thy holy eyes,
  And bright with shadows ever new
    Of changeful sympathies,
  Which in thy soul's unruffled deep
  Rest evermore, but never sleep
  He who hath felt Life's mystery
    Press on him like thick night,
  Whose soul hath known no history
    But struggling after light;--
  He who hath seen dim shapes arise
    In the soundless depths of soul,
  Which gaze on him with meaning eyes
    Full of the mighty whole,
  Yet will no word of healing speak,
    Although he pray night-long,
  "O, help me, save me! I am weak,
    And ye are wondrous strong!"--
  Who, in the midnight dark and deep,
    Hath felt a voice of might
  Come echoing through the halls of sleep
    From the lone heart of Night,
  And, starting from his restless bed,
    Hath watched and wept to know
  What meant that oracle of dread
    That stirred his being so;
  He who hath felt how strong and great
    This Godlike soul of man,
  And looked full in the eyes of Fate,
    Since Life and Thought began;
  The armor of whose moveless trust
    Knoweth no spot of weakness,
  Who hath trod fear into the dust
    Beneath the feet of meekness;--
  He who hath calmly borne his cross,
    Knowing himself the king
  Of time, nor counted it a loss
    To learn by suffering;--
  And who hath worshipped woman still
    With a pure soul and lowly,
  Nor ever hath in deed or will
    Profaned her temple holy--
  He is the Poet, him unto
    The gift of song is given,
  Whose life is lofty, strong, and true,
  He is the Poet, from his lips
    To live forevermore,
  Majestical as full-sailed ships,
    The words of Wisdom pour
   "Hail be thou, holie hearbe,
      Growing on the ground,
    All in the mount Calvary
      First wert thou found;
    Thou art good for manie a sore,
      Thou healest manie a wound,
    In the name of sweete Jesus
      I take thee from the ground."
                   --_Ancient Charm-verse._
    When, from a pleasant ramble, home
  Fresh-stored with quiet thoughts, I come,
  I pluck some wayside flower
  And press it in the choicest nook
  Of a much-loved and oft-read book;
  And, when upon its leaves I look
  In a less happy hour,
  Dear memory bears me far away
  Unto her fairy bower,
  And on her breast my head I lay,
  While, in a motherly, sweet strain,
  She sings me gently back again
  To by-gone feelings, until they
  Seem children born of yesterday
    Yes, many a story of past hours
  I read in these dear withered flowers,
  And once again I seem to be
  Lying beneath the old oak tree,
  And looking up into the sky,
  Through thick leaves rifted fitfully,
  Lulled by the rustling of the vine,
  Or the faint low of far-off kine;
  And once again I seem
  To watch the whirling bubbles flee,
  Through shade and gleam alternately,
  Down the vine-bowered stream;
  Or 'neath the odorous linden trees,
  When summer twilight lingers long,
  To hear the flowing of the breeze
  And unseen insects' slumberous song,
  That mingle into one and seem
  Like dim murmurs of a dream;
  Fair faces, too, I seem to see,
  Smiling from pleasant eyes at me,
  And voices sweet I hear,
  That, like remembered melody,
  Flow through my spirit's ear
    A poem every flower is,
  And every leaf a line,
  And with delicious memories
  They fill this heart of mine:
  No living blossoms are so clear
  As these dead relics treasured here;
  One tells of Love, of friendship one,
  Love's quiet after-sunset time,
  When the all-dazzling light is gone,
  And, with the soul's low vesper-chime,
  O'er half its heaven doth out-flow
  A holy calm and steady glow.
  Some are gay feast-songs, some are dirges,
  In some a joy with sorrow merges;
  One sings the shadowed woods, and one the roar
  Of ocean's everlasting surges,
  Tumbling upon the beach's hard-beat floor,
  Or sliding backward from the shore
  To meet the landward waves and slowly plunge once more.
  O flowers of grace, I bless ye all
  By the dear faces ye recall
    Upon the banks of Life's deep streams
  Full many a flower groweth,
  Which with a wondrous fragrance teems,
  And in the silent water gleams,
  And trembles as the water floweth,
  Many a one the wave upteareth,
  Washing ever the roots away,
  And far upon its bosom beareth,
  To bloom no more in Youth's glad May;
  As farther on the river runs,
  Flowing more deep and strong,
  Only a few pale, scattered ones
  Are seen the dreary banks along;
  And where those flowers do not grow,
  The river floweth dark and chill,
  Its voice is sad, and with its flow
  Mingles ever a sense of ill;
  Then, Poet, thou who gather dost
  Of Life's best flowers the brightest,
  O, take good heed they be not lost
  While with the angry flood thou fightest
    In the cool grottos of the soul,
  Whence flows thought's crystal river,
  Whence songs of joy forever roll
  To Him who is the Giver--
  There store thou them, where fresh and green
  Their leaves and blossoms may be seen,
  A spring of joy that faileth never;
  There store thou them, and they shall be
  A blessing and a peace to thee,
  And in their youth and purity
  Thou shalt be young forever!
  Then, with their fragrance rich and rare,
  Thy living shall be rife,
  Strength shall be thine thy cross to bear,
  And they shall be a chaplet fair,
  Breathing a pure and holy air,
  To crown thy holy life
    O Poet! above all men blest,
  Take heed that thus thou store them;
  Love, Hope, and Faith shall ever rest,
  Sweet birds (upon how sweet a nest!)
  Watchfully brooding o'er them.
  And from those flowers of Paradise
  Scatter thou many a blessÃ¨d seed,
  Wherefrom an offspring may arise
  To cheer the hearts and light the eyes
  Of after-voyagers in their need.
  They shall not fall on stony ground,
  But, yielding all their hundred-fold,
  Shall shed a peacefulness around,
  Whose strengthening joy may not be told,
  So shall thy name be blest of all,
  And thy remembrance never die;
  For of that seed shall surely fall
  In the fair garden of Eternity.
  Exult then in the nobleness
  Of this thy work so holy,
  Yet be not thou one jot the less
  Humble and meek and lowly,
  But let thine exultation be
  The reverence of a bended knee;
  And by thy life a poem write,
  Built strongly day by day--
  And on the rock of Truth and Right
  Its deep foundations lay
    It is thy |DUTY|! Guard it well!
  For unto thee hath much been given,
  And thou canst make this life a Hell,
  Or Jacob's-ladder up to Heaven.
  Let not thy baptism in Life's wave
  Make thee like him whom Homer sings--
  A sleeper in a living grave,
  Callous and hard to outward things;
  But open all thy soul and sense
  To every blessÃ¨d influence
  That from the heart of Nature springs:
  Then shall thy Life-flowers be to thee,
  When thy best years are told,
  As much as these have been to me--
  Yea, more, a thousand-fold
    Go from the world from East to West,
  Search every land beneath the sky,
  You cannot find a man so blest,
  A king so powerful as I,
  Though you should seek eternally
    For I a gentle lover be,
  Sitting at my loved-one's side;
  She giveth her whole soul to me
  Without a wish or thought of pride,
  And she shall be my cherished bride
    No show of gaudiness hath she,
  She doth not flash with jewels rare;
  In beautiful simplicity
  She weareth leafy garlands fair,
  Or modest flowers in her hair
    Sometimes she dons a robe of green,
  Sometimes a robe of snowy white,
  But, in whatever garb she's seen,
  It seems most beautiful and right,
  And is the loveliest to my sight
    Not I her lover am alone,
  Yet unto all she doth suffice,
  None jealous is, and every one
  Reads love and truth within her eyes,
  And deemeth her his own dear prize
    And so thou art, Eternal Nature!
  Yes, bride of Heaven, so thou art;
  Thou, wholly lovest every creature,
  Giving to each no stinted part,
  But filling every peaceful heart
  "Dear Child! dear happy Girl! if thou appear
  Heedless--untouched with awe or serious thought,
  Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
  Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;
  And worship'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
  God being with thee when we know it not."
                              --_Wordsworth._
    As through a strip of sunny light
  A white dove flashes swiftly on,
  So suddenly before my sight
  Thou gleamed'st a moment and wert gone;
  And yet I long shall bear in mind
  The pleasant thoughts thou left'st behind
    Thou mad'st me happy with thine eyes,
  And happy with thine open smile,
  And, as I write, sweet memories
  Come thronging round me all the while;
  Thou mad'st me happy with thine eyes--
  And gentle feelings long forgot
  Looked up and oped their eyes,
  Like violets when they see a spot
  Of summer in the skies
    Around thy playful lips did glitter
  Heat-lightnings of a girlish scorn;
  Harmless they were, for nothing bitter
  In thy dear heart was ever born--
  That merry heart that could not lie
  Within its warm nest quietly,
  But ever from each full, dark eye
  Was looking kindly night and morn
    There was an archness in thine eyes,
  Born of the gentlest mockeries,
  And thy light laughter rang as clear
  As water-drops I loved to hear
  In days of boyhood, as they fell
  Tinkling far down the dim, still well;
  And with its sound come back once more
  The feelings of my early years,
  And half aloud I murmured o'er--
  "Sure I have heard that sound before,
  It is so pleasant in mine ears
    Whenever thou didst look on me
  I thought of merry birds,
  And something of spring's melody
  Came to me in thy words;
  Thy thoughts did dance and bound along
  Like happy children in their play,
  Whose hearts run over into song
  For gladness of the summer's day;
  And mine grew dizzy with the sight,
  Still feeling lighter and more light,
  Till, joining hands, they whirled away,
  As blithe and merrily as they
    I bound a larch-twig round with flowers,
  Which thou didst twine among thy hair,
  And gladsome were the few, short hours
  When I was with thee there;
  So now that thou art far away,
  Safe-nestled in thy warmer clime,
  In memory of a happier day
  I twine this simple wreath of rhyme
    Dost mind how she, whom thou dost love
  More than in light words may be said,
  A coronal of amaranth wove
  About thy duly-sobered head,
  Which kept itself a moment still
  That she might have her gentle will?
  Thy childlike grace and purity
  O keep forevermore,
  And as thou art, still strive to be,
  That on the farther shore
  Of Time's dark waters ye may meet,
  And she may twine around thy brow
  A wreath of those bright flowers that grow
  Where blessÃ¨d angels set their feet
    As the leaf upon the tree,
  Fluttering, gleaming constantly,
  Such a lightsome thing was she,
  My gay and gentle Isabel!
  Her heart was fed with love-springs sweet,
  And in her face you'd see it beat
  To hear the sound of welcome feet--
  And were not mine so, Isabel
    She knew it not, but she was fair,
  And like a moonbeam was her hair,
  That falls where flowing ripples are
  In summer evenings, Isabel!
  Her heart and tongue were scarce apart,
  Unwittingly her lips would part,
  And love came gushing from her heart,
  The woman's heart of Isabel
    So pure her flesh-garb, and like dew,
  That in her features glimmered through
  Each working of her spirit true,
  In wondrous beauty, Isabel!
  A sunbeam struggling through thick leaves,
  A reaper's song mid yellow sheaves,
  Less gladsome were;--my spirit grieves
  To think of thee, mild Isabel
    I know not when I loved thee first;
  Not loving, I had been accurst,
  Yet, having loved, my heart will burst,
  Longing for thee, dear Isabel!
  With silent tears my cheeks are wet,
  I would be calm, I would forget,
  But thy blue eyes gaze on me yet,
  When stars have risen, Isabel
    The winds mourn for thee, Isabel,
  The flowers expect thee in the dell,
  Thy gentle spirit loved them well;
  And I for thy sake, Isabel!
  The sunsets seem less lovely now
  Than when, leaf checkered, on thy brow
  They fell as lovingly as thou
  Lingered'st till moon-rise, Isabel
    At dead of night I seem to see
  Thy fair, pale features constantly
  Upturned in silent prayer for me,
  O'er moveless clasped hands, Isabel!
  I call thee, thou dost not reply;
  The stars gleam coldly on thine eye,
  As like a dream thou flittest by,
  And leav'st me weeping, Isabel
  I seem to lie with drooping eyes,
    Dreaming sweet dreams,
  Half longings and half memories,
    In woods where streams
  With trembling shades and whirling gleams,
    Many and bright,
    In song and light,
    Are ever, ever flowing;
  While the wind, if we list to the rustling grass,
  Which numbers his footsteps as they pass,
    Seems scarcely to be blowing;
  And the far-heard voice of Spring,
  From sunny slopes comes wandering,
  Calling the violets from the sleep,
  That bound them under snow-drifts deep,
  To open their childlike, asking eyes
  On the new summer's paradise,
  And mingled with the gurgling waters--
  As the dreamy witchery
  Of AcheloÃ¼s' silver-voiced daughters
    Rose and fell with the heaving sea,
    Whose great heart swelled with ecstasy--
  The song of many a floating bird,
    Winding through the rifted trees,
  Is dreamily half-heard--
  A sister stream of melodies
  Rippled by the flutterings
  Of rapture-quivered wings
  And now beside a cataract
  I lie, and through my soul,
  From over me and under,
  The never-ceasing thunder
  Arousingly doth roll;
  Through the darkness all compact,
  Through the trackless sea of gloom,
  Sad and deep I hear it boom;
  At intervals the cloud is cracked
  And a livid flash doth hiss
    Downward from its floating home,
  Lighting up the precipice
    And the never-resting foam
  With a dim and ghastly glare,
  Which, for a heart-beat, in the air,
    Shows the sweeping shrouds
    Of the midnight clouds
  And their wildly-scattered hair
  Now listening to a woman's tone,
  In a wood I sit alone--
  Alone because our souls are one;--
  All around my heart it flows,
  Lulling me in deep repose;
  I fear to speak, I fear to move,
  Lest I should break the spell I love--
  Low and gentle, calm and clear,
  Into my inmost soul it goes,
    As if my brother dear,
    Who is no longer here,
    Had bended from the sky
    And murmured in my ear
  A strain of that high harmony,
    Which they may sing alone
    Who worship round the throne
  Now in a fairy boat,
    On the bright waves of song,
    Full merrily I float,
    Merrily float along;
    My helm is veered, I care not how,
    My white sail bellies over me,
  And bright as gold the ripples be
  That plash beneath the bow;
    Before, behind,
    They feel the wind,
    And they are dancing joyously--
  While, faintly heard, along the far-off shore
  The surf goes plunging with a lingering roar;
    Or anchored in a shadowy cove,
      Entranced with harmonies,
      Slowly I sink and rise
    As the slow waves of music move
  Now softly dashing,
  Bubbling, plashing,
  Mazy, dreamy,
  Faint and streamy,
  Ripples into ripples melt,
  Not so strongly heard as felt;
  Now rapid and quick,
  While the heart beats thick,
  The music silver wavelets crowd,
  Distinct and clear, but never loud
  And now all solemnly and slow,
  In mild, deep tones they warble low,
  Like the glad song of angels, when
  They sang good will and peace to men;
  Now faintly heard and far,
    As if the spirit's ears
  Had caught the anthem of a star
    Chanting with his brother-spheres
  In the midnight dark and deep,
  When the body is asleep
  And wondrous shadows pour in streams
  From the twofold gate of dreams;
  Now onward roll the billows, swelling
  With a tempest-sound of might,
  As of voices doom foretelling
    To the silent ear of Night;
  And now a mingled ecstasy
    Of all sweet sounds it is;--
  O! who may tell the agony
    Of rapture such as this
  I have drunk of the drink of immortals,
    I have drunk of the life-giving wine,
  And now I may pass the bright portals
    That open into a realm divine!
  I have drunk it through mine ears
    In the ecstasy of song,
  When mine eyes would fill with tears
    That its life were not more long;
  I have drunk it through mine eyes
    In beauty's every shape,
  And now around my soul it lies,
    No juice of earthly grape!
  Wings! wings are given to me,
    I can flutter, I can rise,
  Like a new life gushing through me
    Sweep the heavenly harmonies
  O! I must look on that sweet face once more before I die;
  God grant that it may lighten up with joy when I draw nigh;
  God grant that she may look on me as kindly as she seems
  In the long night, the restless night, i' the sunny land of dreams
  I hoped, I thought, she loved me once, and yet, I know not why,
  There is a coldness in her speech, and a coldness in her eye.
  Something that in another's look would not seem cold to me,
  And yet like ice I feel it chill the heart of memory
  She does not come to greet me so frankly as she did,
  And in her utmost openness I feel there's something hid;
  She almost seems to shun me, as if she thought that I
  Might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by
  I sought the first spring-buds for her, the fairest and the best,
  And she wore them for their loveliness upon her spotless breast,
  The blood-root and the violet, the frail anemone,
  She wore them, and alas! I deemed it was for love of me
  As flowers in a darksome place stretch forward to the light,
  So to the memory of her I turn by day and night;
  As flowers in a darksome place grow thin and pale and wan,
  So is it with my darkened heart, now that her light is gone
  The thousand little things that love doth treasure up for aye,
  And brood upon with moistened eyes when she that's loved's away,
  The word, the look, the smile, the blush, the ribbon that she wore,
  Each day they grow more dear to me, and pain me more and more
  My face I cover with my hands, and bitterly I weep,
  That the quick-gathering sands of life should choke a love so deep,
  And that the stream, so pure and bright, must turn it from its track,
  Or to the heart-springs, whence it rose, roll its full waters back
  As calm as doth the lily float close by the lakelet's brim,
  So calm and spotless, down time's stream, her peaceful days did swim,
  And I had longed, and dreamed, and prayed, that closely by her side,
  Down to a haven still and sure, my happy life might glide
  But now, alas! those golden days of youth and hope are o'er,
  And I must dream those dreams of joy, those guiltless dreams no more;
  Yet there is something in my heart that whispers ceaselessly,
  "Would God that I might see that face once more before I die
        There is a light within her eyes,
      Like gleams of wandering fire-flies;
      From light to shade it leaps and moves
      Whenever in her soul arise
      The holy shapes of things she loves;
      Fitful it shines and changes ever,
      Like star-lit ripples on a river,
      Or summer sunshine on the eaves
      Of silver-trembling poplar leaves,
      Where the lingering dew-drops quiver.
      I may not tell the blessedness
      Her mild eyes send to mine,
      The sunset-tinted haziness
      Of their mysterious shine,
      The dim and holy mournfulness
      Of their mellow light divine;
      The shadow of the lashes lie
      Over them so lovingly,
      That they seem to melt away
      In a doubtful twilight-gray,
      While I watch the stars arise
      In the evening of her eyes,
      I love it, yet I almost dread
      To think what it foreshadoweth;
      And, when I muse how I have read
      That such strange light betokened death--
      Instead of fire-fly gleams, I see
      Wild corpse-lights gliding waveringly
        With wayward thoughts her eyes are bright,
      Like shiftings of the northern-light,
      Hither, thither, swiftly glance they,
      In a mazy twining dance they,
      Like ripply lights the sunshine weaves,
      Thrown backward from a shaken nook,
      Below some tumbling water-brook,
      On the o'erarching platan-leaves,
      All through her glowing face they flit,
      And rest in their deep dwelling-place,
      Those fathomless blue eyes of hers,
      Till, from her burning soul re-lit,
      While her upheaving bosom stirs,
      They stream again across her face
      And with such hope and glory fill it,
      Death could not have the heart to chill it.
      Yet when their wild light fades again,
      I feel a sudden sense of pain,
      As if, while yet her eyes were gleaming,
      And like a shower of sun-lit rain
      Bright fancies from her face were streaming,
      Her trembling soul might flit away
      As swift and suddenly as they
      A wild, inspirÃ¨d earnestness
        Her inmost being fills,
      And eager self-forgetfulness,
        That speaks not what it wills,
      But what unto her soul is given,
      A living oracle from Heaven,
      Which scarcely in her breast is born
      When on her trembling lips it thrills,
      And, like a burst of golden skies
      Through storm-clouds on a sudden torn,
      Like a glory of the morn,
      Beams marvellously from her eyes.
      And then, like a Spring-swollen river,
  Roll the deep waves of her full-hearted thought
      Crested with sun-lit spray,
      Her wild lips curve and quiver,
  And my rapt soul, on the strong tide upcaught,
      Unwittingly is borne away,
      Lulled by a dreamful music ever,
      Far--through the solemn twilight-gray
      Of hoary woods--through valleys green
  Which the trailing vine embowers,
  And where the purple-clustered grapes are seen
  Deep-glowing through rich clumps of waving flowers--
      Now over foaming rapids swept
      And with maddening rapture shook--
  Now gliding where the water-plants have slept
      For ages in a moss-rimmed nook--
      Enwoven by a wild-eyed band
        Of earth-forgetting dreams,
      I float to a delicious land
      By a sunset heaven spanned,
        And musical with streams;--
      Around, the calm, majestic forms
  And god-like eyes of early Greece I see,
      Or listen, till my spirit warms,
      To songs of courtly chivalry,
  Or weep, unmindful if my tears be seen,
  For the meek, suffering love of poor Undine
        Her thoughts are never memories,
      But ever changeful, ever new,
      Fresh and beautiful as dew
      That in a dell at noontide lies,
      Or, at the close of summer day,
      The pleasant breath of new-mown hay:
      Swiftly they come and pass
      As golden birds across the sun,
      As light-gleams on tall meadow-grass
      Which the wind just breathes upon.
      And when she speaks, her eyes I see
  Down-gushing through their silken lattices,
      Like stars that quiver tremblingly
      Through leafy branches of the trees,
      And her pale cheeks do flush and glow
      With speaking flashes bright and rare
  As crimson North-lights on new-fallen snow,
      From out the veiling of her hair--
  Her careless hair that scatters down
      On either side her eyes,
  A waterfall leaf-tinged with brown
      And lit with the sunrise
      When first I saw her, not of earth,
    But heavenly both in grief and mirth,
    I thought her; she did seem
    As fair and full of mystery,
    As bodiless, as forms we see
    In the rememberings of a dream;
    A moon-lit mist, a strange, dim light,
    Circled her spirit from my sight;--
    Each day more beautiful she grew,
      More earthly every day,
    Yet that mysterious, moony hue
      Faded not all away;
    She has a sister's sympathy
    With all the wanderers of the sky,
    But most I've seen her bosom stir
      When moonlight round her fell,
    For the mild moon it loveth her,
      She loveth it as well,
    And of their love perchance this grace
    Was born into her wondrous face.
    I cannot tell how it may be,
    For both, methinks, can scarce be true,
    Still, as she earthly grew to me,
    She grew more heavenly too;
      She seems one born in Heaven
        With earthly feelings,
      For, while unto her soul are given
        More pure revealings
      Of holiest love and truth,
    Yet is the mildness of her eyes
    Made up of quickest sympathies,
      Of kindliness and ruth;
    So, though some shade of awe doth stir
    Our souls for one so far above us,
    We feel secure that she will love us,
    And cannot keep from loving her.
    She is a poem, which to me
    In speech and look is written bright,
    And to her life's rich harmony
    Doth ever sing itself aright;
    Dear, glorious creature!
      With eyes so dewy bright,
        And tenderest feeling
        Itself revealing
      In every look and feature,
      Welcome as a homestead light
  To one long-wandering in a clouded night,
      O, lovelier for her woman's weakness,
        Which yet is strongly mailed
      In armor of courageous meekness
        And faith that never failed
        Early and late, at her soul's gate,
      Sits Chastity in warderwise,
      No thoughts unchallenged, small or great,
      Go thence into her eyes;
      Nor may a low, unworthy thought
      Beyond that virgin warder win,
      Nor one, whose password is not "ought,"
      May go without or enter in.
      I call her, seeing those pure eyes,
      The Eve of a new Paradise,
      Which she by gentle word and deed,
      And look no less, doth still create
      About her, for her great thoughts breed
      A calm that lifts us from our fallen state,
  And makes us while with her both good and great--
      Nor is their memory wanting in our need:
      With stronger loving, every hour,
      Turneth my heart to this frail flower,
      Which, thoughtless of the world, hath grown
      To beauty and meek gentleness,
      Here in a fair world of its own--
      By woman's instinct trained alone--
      A lily fair which God did bless,
      And which from Nature's heart did draw
  Love, wisdom, peace, and Heaven's perfect law
    I built an altar in my soul,
  I builded it to one alone;
  And ever silently I stole,
  In happy days of long-agone,
  To make rich offerings to that
   'Twas garlanded with purest thought,
  And crowned with fancy's flowers bright,
  With choicest gems 'twas all inwrought
  Of truth and feeling; in my sight
  It seemed a spot of cloudless light
    Yet when I made my offering there,
  Like Cain's, the incense would not rise;
  Back on my heart down-sank the prayer,
  And altar-stone and sacrifice
  Grew hateful in my tear-dimmed eyes
    O'er-grown with age's mosses green,
  The little altar firmly stands;
  It is not, as it once hath been,
  A selfish shrine;--these time-taught hands
  Bring incense now from many lands
    Knowledge doth only widen love;
  The stream, that lone and narrow rose,
  Doth, deepening ever, onward move,
  And with an even current flows
  Calmer and calmer to the close
    The love, that in those early days
  Girt round my spirit like a wall,
  Hath faded like a morning haze,
  And flames, unpent by self's mean thrall,
  Rise clearly to the perfect
    I cannot say a scene is fair
  Because it is beloved of thee,
  But I shall love to linger there,
  For sake of thy dear memory;
  I would not be so coldly just
  As to love only what I must
    I cannot say a thought is good
  Because thou foundest joy in it;
  Each soul must choose its proper food
  Which Nature hath decreed most fit;
  But I shall ever deem it so
  Because it made thy heart o'erflow
    I love thee for that thou art fair;
  And that thy spirit joys in aught
  Createth a new beauty there,
  With thine own dearest image fraught;
  And love, for others' sake that springs,
  Gives half their charm to lovely things
    I feel the bandages unroll
    That bound my inward seeing;
  Freed are the bright wings of my soul,
    Types of my god-like being;
  High thoughts are swelling in my heart
    And rushing through my brain;
  May I never more lose part
    In my soul's realm again!
  All things fair, where'er they be,
  In earth or air, in sky or sea,
  I have loved them all, and taken
  All within my throbbing breast;
  No more my spirit can be shaken
  From its calm and kingly rest!
  Love hath shed its light around me,
  Love hath pierced the shades that bound me;
  Mine eyes are opened, I can see
  The universe's mystery,
    The mighty heart and core
    Of After and Before
  I see, and I am weak no more
    Upward! upward evermore,
  To Heaven's open gate I soar!
  Little thoughts are far behind me,
  Which, when custom weaves together,
  All the nobler man can tether--
  Cobwebs now no more can bind me!
  Now fold thy wings a little while,
    My trancÃ¨d soul, and lie
  At rest on this Calypso-isle
    That floats in mellow sky,
  A thousand isles with gentle motion
  Rock upon the sunset ocean;
  A thousand isles of thousand hues,
  How bright! how beautiful! how rare!
  Into my spirit they infuse
  A purer, a diviner air;
  The earth is growing dimmer,
  And now the last faint glimmer
    Hath faded from the hill;
  But in my higher atmosphere
  The sun-light streameth red and clear,
    Fringing the islets still;--
  Love lifts us to the sun-light,
  Though the whole world would be dark;
  Love, wide Love, is the one light,
  All else is but a fading spark;
  Love is the nectar which doth fill
  Our soul's cup even to overflowing,
  And, warming heart, and thought, and will,
  Doth lie within us mildly glowing,
  From its own centre raying out
  Beauty and Truth on all without
    Each on his golden throne,
  Full royally, alone,
  I see the stars above me,
  With sceptre and with diadem;
  Mildly they look down and love me,
  For I have ever yet loved them;
  I see their ever-sleepless eyes
  Watching the growth of destinies;
      Calm, sedate,
      The eyes of Fate,
  They wink not, nor do roll,
  But search the depths of soul--
  And in those mighty depths they see
  The germs of all Futurity,
  Waiting but the fitting time
  To burst and ripen into prime,
  As in the womb of mother Earth
  The seeds of plants and forests lie
  Age upon age and never die--
  So in the souls of all men wait,
  Undyingly the seeds of Fate;
  Chance breaks the clod and forth they spring,
  Filling blind men with wondering.
  Eternal stars! with holy awe,
  As if a present God I saw,
  I look into those mighty eyes
  And see great destinies arise,
  As in those of mortal men
  Feelings glow and fade again!
  All things below, all things above,
  Are open to the eyes of Love
    Of Knowledge Love is master-key,
  Knowledge of Beauty; passing dear
  Is each to each, and mutually
  Each one doth make the other clear;
  Beauty is Love, and what we love
  Straightway is beautiful,
  So is the circle round and full,
  And so dear Love doth live and move
    And have his being,
  Finding his proper food
    By sure inseeing,
  In all things pure and good,
  Which he at will doth cull,
  Like a joyous butterfly
  Hiving in the sunny bowers
  Of the soul's fairest flowers,
  Or, between the earth and sky,
  Wandering at liberty
  For happy, happy hours
    The thoughts of Love are Poesy,
  As this fair earth and all we see
  Are the thoughts of Deity--
  And Love is ours by our birthright!
  He hath cleared mine inward sight;
  Glorious shapes with glorious eyes
  Round about my spirit glance,
  Shedding a mild and golden light
  On the shadowy face of Night;
  To unearthly melodies,
  Hand in hand, they weave their dance,
  While a deep, ambrosial lustre
    From their rounded limbs doth shine,
  Through many a rich and golden cluster
  Of streaming hair divine.
  In our gross and earthly hours
  We cannot see the Love-given powers
  Which ever round the soul await
    To do its sovereign will,
  When, in its moments calm and still,
  It re-assumes its royal state,
  Nor longer sits with eyes downcast,
  A beggar, dreaming of the past,
  At its own palace-gate
    I too am a Maker and a Poet;
  Through my whole soul I feel it and know it;
  My veins are fired with ecstasy!
    All-mother Earth
    Did ne'er give birth
  To one who shall be matched with me;
  The lustre of my coronal
  Shall cast a dimness over all.--
  Alas! alas! what have I spoken?
  My strong, my eagle wings are broken,
  And back again to earth I fall
    When first I saw thy soul-deep eyes,
  My heart yearned to thee instantly,
  Strange longing in my soul did rise;
  I cannot tell the reason why,
  But I must love thee till I die
    The sight of thee hath well-nigh grown
  As needful to me as the light;
  I am unrestful when alone,
  And my heart doth not beat aright
  Except it dwell within thy sight
    And yet--and yet--O selfish love!
  I am not happy even with thee;
  I see thee in thy brightness move,
  And cannot well contented be,
  Save thou should'st shine alone for me
    We should love beauty even as flowers--
  For all, 'tis said, they bud and blow,
  They are the world's as well as ours--
  But thou--alas! God made thee grow
  So fair, I cannot love thee so
    The flowers and the grass to me
  Are eloquent reproachfully;
  For would they wave so pleasantly
  Or look so fresh and fair,
  If a man, cunning, hollow, mean,
  Or one in anywise unclean,
  Were looking on them there
    No; he hath grown so foolish-wise
  He cannot see with childhood's eyes;
  He hath forgot that purity
  And lowliness which are the key
  Of Nature's mysteries;
  No; he hath wandered off so long
  From his own place of birth,
  That he hath lost his mother-tongue,
  And, like one come from far-off lands,
  Forgetting and forgot, he stands
  Beside his mother's hearth
  I wandered down the sunny glade
    And ever mused, my love, of thee;
  My thoughts, like little children, played,
    As gayly and as guilelessly
  If any chanced to go astray,
    Moaning in fear of coming harms,
  Hope brought the wanderer back alway,
    Safe nestled in her snowy arms
  From that soft nest the happy one
    Looked up at me and calmly smiled;
  Its hair shone golden in the sun,
    And made it seem a heavenly child
  Dear Hope's blue eyes smiled mildly down,
    And blest it with a love so deep,
  That, like a nursling of her own,
    It clasped her neck and fell asleep
  I love the rites of England's church;
    I love to hear and see
  The priest and people reading slow
    The solemn Litany;
  I love to hear the glorious swell
    Of chanted psalm and prayer,
  And the deep organ's bursting heart,
    Throb through the shivering air
  Chants, that a thousand years have heard,
    I love to hear again,
  For visions of the olden time
    Are wakened by the strain;
  With gorgeous hues the window-glass
    Seems suddenly to glow,
  And rich and red the streams of light
    Down through the chancel flow
  And then I murmur, "Surely God
    Delighteth here to dwell;
  This is the temple of his Son
    Whom he doth love so well;"
  But, when I hear the creed which saith,
    This church alone is His,
  I feel within my soul that He
    Hath purer shrines than this
  For his is not the builded church,
    Nor organ-shaken dome;
  In every thing that lovely is
    He loves and hath his home;
  And most in soul that loveth well
    All things which he hath made,
  Knowing no creed but simple faith
    That may not be gainsaid
  His church is universal Love,
    And whoso dwells therein
  Shall need no customed sacrifice
    To wash away his sin;
  And music in its aisles shall swell,
    Of lives upright and true,
  Sweet as dreamed sounds of angel-harps
    Down-quivering through the blue
  They shall not ask a litany,
    The souls that worship there,
  But every look shall be a hymn,
    And every word a prayer;
  Their service shall be written bright
    In calm and holy eyes,
  And every day from fragrant hearts
    Fit incense shall arise
    The pretty things that others wear
  Look strange and out of place on me,
  I never seem dressed tastefully,
    Because I am not fair;
  And, when I would most pleasing seem,
  And deck myself with joyful care,
  I find it is an idle dream,
    Because I am not fair
    If I put roses in my hair,
  They bloom as if in mockery;
  Nature denies her sympathy,
    Because I am not fair;
  Alas! I have a warm, true heart,
  But when I show it people stare;
  I must forever dwell apart,
    Because I am not fair
    I am least happy being where
  The hearts of others are most light,
  And strive to keep me out of sight,
    Because I am not fair;
  The glad ones often give a glance,
  As I am sitting lonely there,
  That asks me why I do not dance--
    Because I am not fair
    And if to smile on them I dare,
  For that my heart with love runs o'er,
  They say: "What is she laughing for?"--
    Because I am not fair;
  Love scorned or misinterpreted--
  It is the hardest thing to bear;
  I often wish that I were dead,
    Because I am not fair
    In joy or grief I must not share,
  For neither smiles nor tears on me
  Will ever look becomingly,
    Because I am not fair;
  Whole days I sit alone and cry,
  And in my grave I wish I were--
  Yet none will weep me if I die,
    Because I am not fair
    My grave will be so lone and bare,
  I fear to think of those dark hours,
  For none will plant it o'er with flowers,
    Because I am not fair;
  They will not in the summer come
  And speak kind words above me there;
  To me the grave will be no home,
    Because I am not fair
    Nearer to thy mother-heart,
  Simple Nature, press me,
  Let me know thee as thou art,
  Fill my soul and bless me!
  I have loved thee long and well,
  I have loved thee heartily;
  Shall I never with thee dwell,
  Never be at one with thee
    Inward, inward to thy heart,
  Kindly Nature, take me,
  Lovely even as thou art,
  Full of loving make me!
  Thou knowest naught of dead-cold forms,
  Knowest naught of littleness,
  Lifeful Truth thy being warms,
  Majesty and earnestness
    Homeward, homeward to thy heart,
  Dearest Nature, call me;
  Let no halfness, no mean part,
  Any longer thrall me!
  I will be thy lover true,
  I will be a faithful soul,
  Then circle me, then look me through,
  Fill me with the mighty Whole
    All things are sad:--
  I go and ask of Memory,
  That she tell sweet tales to me
    To make me glad;
  And she takes me by the hand,
    Leadeth to old places,
    Showeth the old faces
  In her hazy mirage-land;
  O, her voice is sweet and low,
  And her eyes are fresh to mine
       As the dew
       Gleaming through
  The half-unfolded Eglantine,
  Long ago, long ago!
  But I feel that I am only
  Yet more sad, and yet more lonely
    Then I turn to blue-eyed Hope,
  And beg of her that she will ope
  Her golden gates for me;
  She is fair and full of grace,
  But she hath the form and face
  Of her mother Memory;
  Clear as air her glad voice ringeth,
  Joyous are the songs she singeth,
  Yet I hear them mournfully;--
  They are songs her mother taught her,
  Crooning to her infant daughter,
  As she lay upon her knee.
  Many little ones she bore me,
  Woe is me! in by-gone hours,
  Who danced along and sang before me,
  Scattering my way with flowers;
       One by one
       They are gone,
  And their silent graves are seen,
  Shining fresh with mosses green,
  Where the rising sunbeams slope
  O'er the dewy land of Hope
    But, when sweet Memory faileth,
  And Hope looks strange and cold;
  When youth no more availeth,
  And Grief grows over bold;--
  When softest winds are dreary,
  And summer sunlight weary,
  And sweetest things uncheery
       We know not why:--
  When the crown of our desires
  Weighs upon the brow and tires,
       And we would die,
  Die for, ah! we know not what,
  Something we seem to have forgot,
  Something we had, and now have not;--
  When the present is a weight
  And the future seems our foe,
  And with shrinking eyes we wait,
  As one who dreads a sudden blow
  In the dark, he knows not whence;--
  When Love at last his bright eye closes,
  And the bloom upon his face,
  That lends him such a living grace,
  Is a shadow from the roses
  Wherewith we have decked his bier,
  Because he once was passing dear;--
  When we feel a leaden sense
  Of nothingness and impotence,
         Till we grow mad--
       Then the body saith,
      "There's but one true faith;
         All things are sad
    Pleasant thoughts come wandering,
    When thou art far, from thee to me;
    On their silver wings they bring
    A very peaceful ecstasy,
    A feeling of eternal spring;
    So that Winter half forgets
    Everything but that thou art,
    And, in his bewildered heart,
    Dreameth of the violets,
    Or those bluer flowers that ope,
    Flowers of steadfast love and hope,
    Watered by the living wells,
  Of memories dear, and dearer prophecies,
    When young spring forever dwells
    In the sunshine of thine eyes
    I have most holy dreams of thee,
     All night I have such dreams;
    And, when I awake, reality
     No whit the darker seems;
  Through the twin gates of Hope and Memory
    They pour in crystal streams
    From out an angel's calmÃ¨d eyes,
    Who, from twilight till sunrise,
    Far away in the upper deep,
    Poised upon his shining wings,
    Over us his watch doth keep,
    And, as he watcheth, ever sings
    Through the still night I hear him sing,
     Down-looking on our sleep;
    I hear his clear, clear harp-strings ring,
    And, as the golden notes take wing,
    Gently downward hovering,
     For very joy I weep;
    He singeth songs of holy Love,
    That quiver through the depths afar,
    Where the blessÃ¨d spirits are,
    And lingeringly from above
    Shower till the morning star
    His silver shield hath buckled on
    And sentinels the dawn alone,
    Quivering his gleamy spear
    Through the dusky atmosphere
    Almost, my love, I fear the morn,
    When that blessÃ¨d voice shall cease,
    Lest it should leave me quite forlorn,
    Stript of my snowy robe of peace;
    And yet the bright reality
    Is fairer than all dreams can be,
    For, through my spirit, all day long,
    Ring echoes of that angel-song
    In melodious thoughts of thee;
    And well I know it cannot die
    Till eternal morn shall break,
    For, through life's slumber, thou and I
    Will keep it for each other's sake,
  And it shall not be silent when we wake
  Our fathers fought for Liberty,
    They struggled long and well,
    History of their deeds can tell--
  But did they leave us free
  Are we free from vanity,
    Free from pride, and free from self,
    Free from love of power and pelf,
  From everything that's beggarly
  Are we free from stubborn will,
    From low hate and malice small,
    From opinion's tyrant thrall?
  Are none of us our own slaves still
  Are we free to speak our thought,
    To be happy, and be poor,
    Free to enter Heaven's door,
  To live and labor as we ought
  Are we then made free at last
    From the fear of what men say,
    Free to reverence To-day,
  Free from the slavery of the Past
  Our fathers fought for liberty,
    They struggled long and well,
    History of their deeds can tell--
  But _ourselves_ must set us free
     Why mourn we for the golden prime
  When our young souls _were_ kingly, strong, and true?
     The soul is greater than all time,
  It changes not, but yet is ever new
     But that the soul _is_ noble, we
  Could never know what nobleness had been;
     Be what ye dream! and earth shall see
  A greater greatness than she e'er hath seen
     The flower pines not to be fair,
  It never asketh to be sweet and dear,
     But gives itself to sun and air,
  And so is fresh and full from year to year
     Nothing in Nature weeps its lot,
  Nothing, save man, abides in memory,
     Forgetful that the Past is what
  Ourselves may choose the coming time to be
     All things are circular; the Past
  Was given us to make the Future great;
     And the void Future shall at last
  Be the strong rudder of an after fate
     We sit beside the Sphinx of Life,
  We gaze into its void, unanswering eyes,
     And spend ourselves in idle strife
  To read the riddle of their mysteries
     Arise! be earnest and be strong!
  The Sphinx's eyes shall suddenly grow clear,
     And speak as plain to thee ere long,
  As the dear maiden's who holds thee most dear
     The meaning of all things in _us_--
  Yea, in the lives we give our souls--doth lie;
     Make, then, their meaning glorious
  By such a life as need not fear to die
     There is no heart-beat in the day,
  Which bears a record of the smallest deed,
     But holds within its faith alway
  That which in doubt we vainly strive to read
     One seed contains another seed,
  And that a third, and so for evermore;
     And promise of as great a deed
  Lies folded in the deed that went before
     So ask not fitting space or time,
  Yet could not dream of things which could not be;
     Each day shall make the next sublime,
  And Time be swallowed in Eternity
     God bless the Present! it is |ALL|;
  It has been Future, and it shall be Past;
     Awake and live! thy strength recall,
  And in one trinity unite them fast
     Action and Life--lo! here the key
  Of all on earth that seemeth dark and wrong;
     Win this--and, with it, freely ye
  May enter that bright realm for which ye long
     Then all these bitter questionings
  Shall with a full and blessÃ¨d answer meet;
     Past worlds, whereof the Poet sings,
  Shall be the earth beneath his snow-white fleet
    Go little book! the world is wide,
  There's room and verge enough for thee;
  For thou hast learned that only pride
  Lacketh fit opportunity,
  Which comes unbid to modesty
    Go! win thy way with gentleness:
  I send thee forth, my first-born child,
  Quite, quite alone, to face the stress
  Of fickle skies and pathways wild,
  Where few can keep them undefiled
    Thou earnest from a poet's heart,
  A warm, still home, and full of rest;
  Far from the pleasant eyes thou art
  Of those who know and love thee best,
  And by whose hearthstones thou wert blest
    Go! knock thou softly at the door
  Where any gentle spirits bin,
  Tell them thy tender feet are sore,
  Wandering so far from all thy kin,
  And ask if thou may enter in
    Beg thou a cup-full from the spring
  Of Charity, in Christ's dear name;
  Few will deny so small a thing,
  Nor ask unkindly if thou came
  Of one whose life might do thee shame
    We all are prone to go astray,
  Our hopes are bright, our lives are dim;
  But thou art pure, and if they say,
  "We know thy father, and our whim
  He pleases not,"--plead thou for him
    For many are by whom all truth,
  That speaks not in their mother-tongue,
  Is stoned to death with hands unruth,
  Or hath its patient spirit wrung
  Cold words and colder looks among
    Yet fear not! for skies are fair
  To all whose souls are fair within;
  Thou wilt find shelter everywhere
  With those to whom a different skin
  Is not a damning proof of sin
    But, if all others are unkind,
  There's _one_ heart whither thou canst fly
  For shelter from the biting wind;
  And, in that home of purity,
  It were no bitter thing to die
  I pray thee call not this society;
  I asked for bread, thou givest me a stone;
  I am an hungered, and I find not one
  To give me meat, to joy or grieve with me;
  I find not here what I went out to see--
  Souls of true men, of women who can move
  The deeper, better part of us to love,
  Souls that can hold with mine communion free.
  Alas! must then these hopes, these longings high,
  This yearning of the soul for brotherhood,
  And all that makes us pure, and wise, and good,
  Come broken-hearted, home again to die?
  No, Hope is left, and prays with bended head,
  "Give us this day, O God, our daily bread
  Great human nature, whither art thou fled?
  Are these things creeping forth and back agen,
  These hollow formalists and echoes, men?
  Art thou entombÃ¨d with the mighty dead?
  In God's name, no! not yet hath all been said,
  Or done, or longed for, that is truly great;
  These pitiful dried crusts will never sate
  Natures for which pure Truth is daily bread;
  We were not meant to plod along the earth,
  Strange to ourselves and to our fellows strange;
  We were not meant to struggle from our birth
  To skulk and creep, and in mean pathways range;
  Act! with stern truth, large faith, and loving will!
  Up and be doing! God is with us still
  One strip of bark may feed the broken tree,
  Giving to some few limbs a sickly green;
  And one light shower on the hills, I ween,
  May keep the spring from drying utterly.
  Thus seemeth it with these our hearts to be;
  Hope is the strip of bark, the shower of rain,
  And so they are not wholly crushed with pain.
  But live and linger on, far sadder sight to see;
  Much do they err, who tell us that the heart
  May not be broken; what, then, can we call
  A broken heart, if this may not be so,
  This death in life, when, shrouded in its pall,
  Shunning and shunned, it dwelleth all apart,
  Its power, its love, its sympathy laid low
  So may it be, but let it not be so,
  O, let it not be so with thee, my friend;
  Be of good courage, bear up to the end,
  And on thine after way rejoicing go!
  We all must suffer, if we aught would know;
  Life is a teacher stern, and wisdom's crown
  Is oft a crown of thorns, whence, trickling down,
  Blood, mixed with tears, blinding her eyes doth flow
  But Time, a gentle nurse, shall wipe away
  This bloody sweat, and thou shalt find on earth,
  That woman is not all in all to Love,
  But, living by a new and second birth,
  Thy soul shall see all things below, above,
  Grow bright and brighter to the perfect day
  O child of Nature! O most meek and free,
  Most gentle spirit of true nobleness!
  Thou doest not a worthy deed the less
  Because the world may not its greatness see;
  What were a thousand triumphings to thee,
  Who, in thyself, art as a perfect sphere
  Wrapt in a bright and natural atmosphere
  Of mighty-souledness and majesty?
  Thy soul is not too high for lowly things,
  Feels not its strength seeing its brother weak,
  Not for itself unto itself is dear,
  But for that it may guide the wanderings
  Of fellow-men, and to their spirits speak
  The lofty faith of heart that knows no fear
  Deem it no Sodom-fruit of vanity,
  Or fickle fantasy of unripe youth
  Which ever takes the fairest shows for truth,
  That I should wish my verse beloved of thee;
  'Tis love's deep thirst which may not quenchÃ¨d be.
  There is a gulf of longing and unrest,
  A wild love-craving not to be represt,
  Whereto, in all our hearts, as to the sea,
  The streams of feeling do forever flow.
  Therefore it is that thy well-meted praise
  Falleth so shower-like and fresh on me,
  Filling those springs which else had sunk full low,
  Lost in the dreary desert-sands of woe,
  Or parched by passion's fierce and withering blaze
  Might I but be beloved, and, O most fair
  And perfect-ordered soul, beloved of thee,
  How should I feel a cloud of earthly care,
  If thy blue eyes were ever clear to me?
  O woman's love! O flower most bright and rare!
  That blossom'st brightest in extremest need,
  Woe, woe is me! that thy so precious seed
  Is ever sown by Fancy's changeful air,
  And grows sometimes in poor and barren hearts,
  Who can be little even in the light
  Of thy meek holiness--while souls more great
  Are left to wander in a starless night,
  Praying unheard--and yet the hardest parts
  Befit those best who best can cope with Fate
  Why should we ever weary of this life?
  Our souls should widen ever, not contract,
  Grow stronger, and not harder, in the strife,
  Filling each moment with a noble act;
  If we live thus, of vigor all compact,
  Doing our duty to our fellow-men,
  And striving rather to exalt our race
  Than our poor selves, with earnest hand or pen
  We shall erect our names a dwelling-place
  Which not all ages shall cast down agen;
  Offspring of Time shall then be born each hour,
  Which, as of old, earth lovingly shall guard,
  To live forever in youth's perfect flower,
  And guide her future children Heavenward
  Ye mountains, that far off lift up your heads,
  Seen dimly through their canopies of blue,
  The shade of my unrestful spirit sheds
  Distance-created beauty over you;
  I am not well content with this far view;
  How may I know what foot of loved-one treads
  Your rocks moss-grown and sun-dried torrent beds?
  We should love all things better, if we knew
  What claims the meanest have upon our hearts:
  Perchance even now some eye, that would be bright
  To meet my own, looks on your mist-robed forms;
  Perchance your grandeur a deep joy imparts
  To souls that have encircled mine with light--
  O brother-heart, with thee my spirit warms
  My friend, adown Life's valley, hand in hand,
  With grateful change of grave and merry speech
  Or song, our hearts unlocking each to each,
  We'll journey onward to the silent land;
  And when stern Death shall loose that loving band,
  Taking in his cold hand a hand of ours,
  The one shall strew the other's grave with flowers,
  Nor shall his heart a moment be unmanned.
  My friend and brother! if thou goest first,
  Wilt thou no more re-visit me below?
  Yea, when my heart seems happy, causelessly
  And swells, not dreaming why, as it would burst
  With joy unspeakable--my soul shall know
  That thou, unseen, art bending over me
  Verse cannot say how beautiful thou art,
  How glorious the calmness of thine eyes,
  Full of unconquerable energies,
  Telling that thou hast acted well thy part.
  No doubt or fear thy steady faith can start,
  No thought of evil dare come nigh to thee,
  Who hast the courage meek of purity,
  The self-stayed greatness of a loving heart,
  Strong with serene, enduring fortitude;
  Where'er thou art, that seems thy fitting place,
  For not of forms, but Nature, art thou child;
  And lowest things put on a noble grace
  When touched by ye, O patient, Ruth-like, mild
  And spotless hands of earnest womanhood
  The soul would fain its loving kindness tell,
  But custom hangs like lead upon the tongue;
  The heart is brimful, hollow crowds among,
  When it finds one whose life and thought are well;
  Up to the eyes its gushing love doth swell,
  The angel cometh and the waters move,
  Yet it is fearful still to say "I love,"
  And words come grating as a jangled bell.
  O might we only speak but what we feel,
  Might the tongue pay but what the heart doth owe,
  Not Heaven's great thunder, when, deep peal on peal,
  It shakes the earth, could rouse our spirits so,
  Or to the soul such majesty reveal,
  As two short words half-spoken faint and low
  I saw a gate: a harsh voice spake and said,
  "This is the gate of Life;" above was writ,
  "Leave hope behind, all ye who enter it;"
  Then shrank my heart within itself for dread;
  But, softer than the summer rain is shed,
  Words dropt upon my soul, and they did say,
  "Fear nothing, Faith shall save thee, watch and pray!"
  So, without fear I lifted up my head,
  And lo! that writing was not, one fair word
  Was carven in its stead, and it was "Love."
  Then rained once more those sweet tones from above
  With healing on their wings: I humbly heard,
  "I am the Life, ask and it shall be given!
  I am the way, by me ye enter Heaven
  To the dark, narrow house where loved ones go,
  Whence no steps outward turn, whose silent door
  None but the sexton knocks at any more,
  Are they not sometimes with us yet below?
  The longings of the soul would tell us so;
  Although, so pure and fine their being's essence,
  Our bodily eyes are witless of their presence,
  Yet not within the tomb their spirits glow,
  Like wizard lamps pent up, but whensoever
  With great thoughts worthy of their high behests
  Our souls are filled, those bright ones with us be,
  As, in the patriarch's tent, his angel guests;--
  O let us live so worthily, that never
  We may be far from that blest company
  I fain would give to thee the loveliest things,
  For lovely things belong to thee of right,
  And thou hast been as peaceful to my sight,
  As the still thoughts that summer twilight brings;
  Beneath the shadow of thine angel wings
  O let me live! O let me rest in thee,
  Growing to thee more and more utterly,
  Upbearing and upborn, till outward things
  Are only as they share in thee a part!
  Look kindly on me, let thy holy eyes
  Bless me from the deep fulness of thy heart;
  So shall my soul in its right strength arise,
  And nevermore shall pine and shrink and start,
  Safe-sheltered in thy full souled sympathies
  Much I had mused of Love, and in my soul
  There was one chamber where I dared not look,
  So much its dark and dreary voidness shook
  My spirit, feeling that I was not whole:
  All my deep longings flowed toward one goal
  For long, long years, but were not answerÃ¨d,
  Till Hope was drooping, Faith well-nigh stone-dead,
  And I was still a blind, earth-delving mole;
  Yet did I know that God was wise and good,
  And would fulfil my being late or soon;
  Nor was such thought in vain, for, seeing thee,
  Great Love rose up, as, o'er a black pine wood,
  Round, bright, and clear, upstarteth the full moon,
  Filling my soul with glory utterly
  Sayest thou, most beautiful, that thou wilt wear
  Flowers and leafy crowns when thou art old,
  And that thy heart shall never grow so cold
  But they shall love to wreath thy silvered hair
  And into age's snows the hope of spring-tide bear?
  O, in thy child-like wisdom's moveless hold
  Dwell ever! still the blessings manifold
  Of purity, of peace, and untaught care
  For other's hearts, around thy pathway shed,
  And thou shalt have a crown of deathless flowers
  To glorify and guard thy blessÃ¨d head
  And give their freshness to thy life's last hours;
  And, when the Bridegroom calleth, they shall be
  A wedding-garment white as snow for thee
  Poet! who sittest in thy pleasant room,
  Warming thy heart with idle thoughts of love,
  And of a holy life that leads above,
  Striving to keep life's spring-flowers still in bloom,
  And lingering to snuff their fresh perfume--
  O, there were other duties meant for thee,
  Than to sit down in peacefulness and Be!
  O, there are brother-hearts that dwell in gloom,
  Souls loathsome, foul, and black with daily sin,
  So crusted o'er with baseness, that no ray
  Of heaven's blessed light may enter in!
  Come down, then, to the hot and dusty way,
  And lead them back to hope and peace again--
  For, save in Act, thy Love is all in vain
  No more but so? Only with uncold looks,
  And with a hand not laggard to clasp mine,
  Think'st thou to pay what debt of love is thine?
  No more but so? Like gushing water-brooks,
  Freshening and making green the dimmest nooks
  Of thy friend's soul thy kindliness should flow;
  But, if 'tis bounded by not saying "no,"
  I can find more of friendship in my books,
  All lifeless though they be, and more, far more
  In every simplest moss, or flower, or tree;
  Open to me thy heart of hearts' deep core,
  Or never say that I am dear to thee;
  Call me not Friend, if thou keep close the door
  That leads into thine inmost sympathy
  Like the low warblings of a leaf-hid bird,
  Thy voice came to me through the screening trees,
  Singing the simplest, long-known melodies;
  I had no glimpse of thee, and yet I heard
  And blest thee for each clearly-carolled word;
  I longed to thank thee, and my heart would frame
  Mary or Ruth, some sisterly, sweet name
  For thee, yet could I not my lips have stirred;
  I knew that thou wert lovely, that thine eyes
  Were blue and downcast, and methought large tears,
  Unknown to thee, up to their lids must rise
  With half-sad memories of other years,
  As to thyself alone thou sangest o'er
  Words that to childhood seemed to say "No More
  Dear, gentle Spenser! thou my soul dost lead,
  A little child again, through Fairy land,
  By many a bower and stream of golden sand,
  And many a sunny plain whose light doth breed
  A sunshine in my happy heart, and feed
  My fancy with sweet visions; I become
  A knight, and with my charmÃ¨d arms would roam
  To seek for fame in many a wondrous deed
  Of high emprize--for I have seen the light
  Of Una's angel's face, the golden hair
  And backward eyes of startled Florimel;
  And, for their holy sake, I would outdare
  A host of cruel Paynims in the fight,
  Or Archimage and all the powers of Hell
  Light of mine eyes! with thy so trusting look,
  And thy sweet smile of charity and love,
  That from a treasure well uplaid above,
  And from a hope in Christ its blessing took;
  Light of my heart! which, when it could not brook
  The coldness of another's sympathy,
  Finds ever a deep peace and stay in thee,
  Warm as the sunshine of a mossy nook;
  Light of my soul! who, by thy saintliness
  And faith that acts itself in daily life,
  Canst raise me above weakness, and canst bless
  The hardest thraldom of my earthly strife--
  I dare not say how much thou art to me
  Even to myself--and O, far less to thee
  Silent as one who treads on new-fallen snow,
  Love came upon me ere I was aware;
  Not light of heart, for there was troublous care
  Upon his eyelids, drooping them full low,
  As with sad memory of a healÃ¨d woe;
  The cold rain shivered in his golden hair,
  As if an outcast lot had been his share,
  And he seemed doubtful whither he should go:
  Then he fell on my neck, and, in my breast
  Hiding his face, awhile sobbed bitterly,
  As half in grief to be so long distrest,
  And half in joy at his security--
  At last, uplooking from his place of rest,
  His eyes shone blessedness and hope on me
  A gentleness that grows of steady faith;
  A joy that sheds its sunshine everywhere;
  A humble strength and readiness to bear
  Those burthens which strict duty ever lay'th
  Upon our souls;--which unto sorrow saith,
  "Here is no soil for thee to strike thy roots,
  Here only grow those sweet and precious fruits;
  Which ripen for the soul that well obey'th;
  A patience which the world can neither give
  Nor take away; a courage strong and high,
  That dares in simple usefulness to live,
  And without one sad look behind to die
  When that day comes;--these tell me that our love
  Is building for itself a home above
  When the glad soul is full to overflow,
  Unto the tongue all power it denies,
  And only trusts its secret to the eyes;
  For, by an inborn wisdom, it doth know
  There is no other eloquence but so;
  And, when the tongue's weak utterance doth suffice,
  Prisoned within the body's cell it lies,
  Remembering in tears its exiled woe:
  That word which all mankind so long to hear,
  Which bears the spirit back to whence it came,
  Maketh this sullen clay as crystal clear,
  And will not be enclouded in a name;
  It is a truth which we can feel and see,
  But is as boundless as Eternity
  When we have once said lowly "Evening-Star!"
  Words give no more--for, in thy silver pride,
  Thou shinest as naught else can shine beside:
  The thick smoke, coiling round the sooty bar
  Forever, and the customed lamp-light mar
  The stillness of my thought--seeing things glide
  So samely:--then I ope my windows wide,
  And gaze in peace to where thou shin'st afar.
  The wind that comes across the faint-white snow
  So freshly, and the river dimly seen,
  Seem like new things that never had been so
  Before; and thou art bright as thou hast been
  Since thy white rays put sweetness in the eyes
  Of the first souls that loved in Paradise
  As one who on some well-known landscape looks,
  Be it alone, or with some dear friend nigh,
  Each day beholdeth fresh variety,
  New harmonies of hills, and trees, and brooks--
  So is it with the worthiest choice of books,
  And oftenest read: if thou no meaning spy,
  Deem there is meaning wanting in thine eyes;
  We are so lured from judgment by the crooks
  And winding ways of covert fantasy,
  Or turned unwittingly down beaten tracks
  Of our foregone conclusions, that we see,
  In our own want, the writer's misdeemed lacks:
  It is with true books as with Nature, each
  New day of living doth new insight teach
  Blue as thine eyes the river gently flows
  Between his banks, which, far as eye can see,
  Are whiter than aught else on earth may be,
  Save inmost thoughts that in thy soul repose;
  The trees all crystalled by the melted snows,
  Sparkle with gems and silver, such as we
  In childhood saw 'mong groves of FaÃ«rie,
  And the dear skies are sunny-blue as those;
  Still as thy heart, when next mine own it lies
  In love's full safety, is the bracing air;
  The earth is all enwrapt with draperies
  Snow-white as that pure love might choose to wear--
  O for one moment's look into thine eyes,
  To share the joy such scene would kindle there
  A Lily with its frail cup filled with dew,
  Down-bending modestly, snow-white and pale,
  Shedding faint fragrance round its native vale,
  Minds me of thee, Sweet Edith, mild and true,
  And of thy eyes so innocent and blue,
  Thy heart is fearful as a startled hare,
  Yet hath in it a fortitude to bear
  For Love's sake, and a gentle faith which grew
  Of Love: need of a stay whereon to lean,
  Felt in thyself, hath taught thee to uphold
  And comfort others, and to give, unseen,
  The kindness thy still love cannot withhold:
  Maiden, I would my sister thou hadst been,
  That round thee I my guarding arms might fold
  My ever-lightsome, ever-laughing Rose,
  Who always speakest first and thinkest last,
  Thy full voice is as clear as bugle-blast;
  Right from the ear down to the heart it goes
  And says, "I'm beautiful! as who but knows?"
  Thy name reminds me of old romping days,
  Of kisses stolen in dark passage-ways,
  Or in the parlor, if the mother-nose
  Gave sign of drowsy watch. I wonder where
  Are gone thy tokens, given with a glance
  So full of everlasting love till morrow,
  Or a day's endless grieving for the dance
  Last night denied, backed with a lock of hair,
  That spake of broken hearts and deadly sorrow
  Dark hair, dark eyes--not too dark to be deep
  And full of feeling, yet enough to glow
  With fire when angered; feelings never slow,
  But which seem rather watching to forthleap
  From her full breast; a gently-flowing sweep
  Of words in common talk, a torrent-rush,
  Whenever through her soul swift feelings gush,
  A heart less ready to be gay than weep,
  Yet cheerful ever; a calm matron-smile,
  That bids God bless you; a chaste simpleness,
  With somewhat, too, of "proper pride," in dress;--
  This portrait to my mind's eye came, the while
  I thought of thee, the well-grown woman Mary,
  Whilome a gold-haired, laughing little fairy
  A staidness sobers o'er her pretty face,
  Which something but ill-hidden in her eyes,
  And a quaint look about her lips denies;
  A lingering love of girlhood you can trace
  In her checked laugh and half-restrainÃ¨d pace;
  And, when she bears herself most womanly,
  It seems as if a watchful mother's eye
  Kept down with sobering glance her childish grace:
  Yet oftentimes her nature gushes free
  As water long held back by little hands,
  Within a pump, and let forth suddenly,
  Until, her task remembering, she stands
  A moment silent, smiling doubtfully,
  Then laughs aloud and scorns her hated bands
  There is a pensiveness in quiet Anne,
  A mournful drooping of the full gray eye,
  As if she had shook hands with misery,
  And known some care since her short life began;
  Her cheek is seriously pale, nigh wan,
  And, though of cheerfulness there is no lack,
  You feel as if she must be dressed in black;
  Yet is she not of those who, all they can,
  Strive to be gay, and striving, seem most sad--
  Hers is not grief, but silent soberness;
  You would be startled if you saw her glad,
  And startled if you saw her weep, no less;
  She walks through life, as, on the Sabbath day,
  She decorously glides to church to pray
    Gone, gone from us! and shall we see
  These sibyl-leaves of destiny,
  Those calm eyes, nevermore?
  Those deep, dark eyes so warm and bright,
  Wherein the fortunes of the man
  Lay slumbering in prophetic light,
  In characters a child might scan?
  So bright, and gone forth utterly!
  O stern word--Nevermore
    The stars of those two gentle eyes
  Will shine no more on earth;
  Quenched are the hopes that had their birth,
  As we watched them slowly rise,
  Stars of a mother's fate;
  And she would read them o'er and o'er,
  Pondering as she sate,
  Over their dear astrology,
  Which she had conned and conned before,
  Deeming she needs must read aright
  What was writ so passing bright.
  And yet, alas! she knew not why,
  Her voice would falter in its song,
  And tears would slide from out her eye,
  Silent, as they were doing wrong.
  O stern word--Nevermore
    The tongue that scarce had learned to claim
  An entrance to a mother's heart
  By that dear talisman, a mother's name,
  Sleeps all forgetful of its art!
  I loved to see the infant soul
  (How mighty in the weakness
  Of its untutored meekness!)
  Peep timidly from out its nest,
  His lips, the while,
  Fluttering with half-fledged words,
  Or hushing to a smile
  That more than words expressed,
  When his glad mother on him stole
  And snatched him to her breast!
  O, thoughts were brooding in those eyes,
  That would have soared like strong-winged birds
  Far, far, into the skies,
  Gladding the earth with song,
  And gushing harmonies,
  Had he but tarried with us long!
  O stern word--Nevermore
    How peacefully they rest,
  Crossfolded there
  Upon his little breast,
  Those small, white hands that ne'er were still before,
  But ever sported with his mother's hair,
  Or the plain cross that on her breast she wore!
  Her heart no more will beat
  To feel the touch of that soft palm,
  That ever seemed a new surprise
  Sending glad thoughts up to her eyes
  To bless him with their holy calm,--
  Sweet thoughts! they made her eyes as sweet.
  How quiet are the hands
  That wove those pleasant bands!
  But that they do not rise and sink
  With his calm breathing, I should think
  That he were dropped asleep.
  Alas! too deep, too deep
  Is this his slumber!
  Time scarce can number
  The years ere he will wake again.
  O, may we see his eyelids open then!
  O stern word--Nevermore
    As the airy gossamere,
  Floating in the sunlight clear,
  Where'er it toucheth clingeth tightly,
  Round glossy leaf or stump unsightly,
  So from his spirit wandered out
  Tendrils spreading all about,
  Knitting all things to its thrall
  With a perfect love of all:
  O stern word--Nevermore
    He did but float a little way
  Adown the stream of time,
  With dreamy eyes watching the ripples play,
  Or listening their fairy chime;
  His slender sail
  Ne'er felt the gale;
  He did but float a little way,
  And, putting to the shore
  While yet 'twas early day,
  Went calmly on his way,
  To dwell with us no more!
  No jarring did he feel,
  No grating on his vessel's keel,
  A strip of silver sand
  Mingled the waters with the land
  Where he was seen no more:
  O stern word--Nevermore
    Full short his journey was; no dust
  Of earth unto his sandals clave;
  The weary weight that old men must,
  He bore not to the grave.
  He seemed a cherub who had lost his way
  And wandered hither, so his stay
  With us was short, and 'twas most meet
  That he should be no delver in earth's clod
  Nor need to pause and cleanse his feet
  To stand before his God:
  O blest word--Evermore
    The sea is lonely, the sea is dreary,
  The sea is restless and uneasy;
  Thou seekest quiet, thou art weary,
  Wandering thou knowest not whither;--
  Our little isle is green and breezy,
  Come and rest thee! O come hither;
  Come to this peaceful home of ours,
        Where evermore
  The low west-wind creeps panting up the shore
  To be at rest among the flowers;
  Full of rest, the green moss lifts,
    As the dark waves of the sea
  Draw in and out of rocky rifts,
    Calling solemnly to thee
  With voices deep and hollow,--
     "To the shore
    Follow! O, follow!
  To be at rest forevermore!
      Forevermore
    Look how the gray old Ocean
  From the depth of his heart rejoices,
  Heaving with a gentle motion,
  When he hears our restful voices;
  List how he sings in an under-tone,
  Chiming with our melody;
  And all sweet sounds of earth and air
  Melt into one low voice alone,
  That murmurs over the weary sea,
  And seems to sing from everywhere,--
  "Here mayst thou harbor peacefully,
  Here mayst thou rest from the aching oar;
    Turn thy curvÃ¨d prow ashore,
  And in our green isle rest for evermore!
      Forevermore!"
  And Echo half wakes in the wooded hill,
    And, to her heart so calm and deep,
    Murmurs over in her sleep,
  Doubtfully pausing and murmuring still,
     "Evermore!"
        Thus, on Life's weary sea,
        Heareth the marinere
        Voices sweet, from far and near,
        Ever singing low and clear,
        Ever singing longingly
    Is it not better here to be,
  Than to be toiling late and soon?
  In the dreary night to see
  Nothing but the blood-red moon
  Go up and down into the sea;
  Or, in the loneliness of day,
    To see the still seals only
  Solemnly lift their faces gray,
    Making it yet more lonely?
  Is it not better, than to hear
  Only the sliding of the wave
  Beneath the plank, and feel so near
  A cold and lonely grave,
  A restless grave, where thou shalt lie
  Even in death unquietly?
  Look down beneath thy wave-worn bark,
    Lean over the side and see
  The leaden eye of the sidelong shark
      UpturnÃ¨d patiently,
    Ever waiting there for thee:
  Look down and see those shapeless forms,
    Which ever keep their dreamless sleep
  Far down within the gloomy deep,
  And only stir themselves in storms,
  Rising like islands from beneath,
  And snorting through the angry spray,
  As the frail vessel perisheth
  In the whirls of their unwieldy play;
      Look down! Look down!
  Upon the seaweed, slimy and dark,
  That waves its arms so lank and brown,
    Beckoning for thee!
  Look down beneath thy wave-worn bark
    Into the cold depth of the sea!
      Look down! Look down!
        Thus on Life's lonely sea,
        Heareth the marinere
        Voices sad, from far and near,
        Ever singing full of fear,
        Ever singing drearfully
    Here all is pleasant as a dream;
  The wind scarce shaketh down the dew,
  The green grass floweth like a stream
        Into the ocean's blue;
          Listen! O, listen!
  Here is a gush of many streams,
    A song of many birds,
  And every wish and longing seems
  Lulled to a numbered flow of words,--
          Listen! O, listen!
  Here ever hum the golden bees
  Underneath full-blossomed trees,
  At once with glowing fruit and flowers crowned;--
  The sand is so smooth, the yellow sand,
  That thy keel will not grate as it touches the land
  All around with a slumberous sound,
  The singing waves slide up the strand,
  And there, where the smooth, wet pebbles be,
  The waters gurgle longingly,
  As if they fain would seek the shore,
  To be at rest from the ceaseless roar,
  To be at rest forevermore,--
      Forevermore.
          Thus, on Life's gloomy sea,
          Heareth the marinere
          Voices sweet, from far and near,
          Ever singing in his ear,
          "Here is rest and peace for thee
    |Nantasket|, _July, _
                  IRENÃ
    Hers is a spirit deep, and crystal-clear,
  Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies,
  Free without boldness, meek without a fear,
  Quicker to look than speak its sympathies;
  Far down into her large and patient eyes
  I gaze, deep-drinking of the infinite,
  As, in the mid-watch of a clear, still night,
  I look into the fathomless blue skies
    So circled lives she with Love's holy light,
  That from the shade of self she walketh free;
  The garden of her soul still keepeth she
  An Eden where the snake did never enter;
  She hath a natural, wise sincerity,
  A simple truthfulness, and these have lent her
  A dignity as moveless as the centre;
  So that no influence of earth can stir
  Her steadfast courage, nor can take away
  The holy peacefulness, which, night and day,
  Unto her queenly soul doth minister
    Most gentle is she; her large charity
  (An all unwitting, child-like gift in her)
  Not freer is to give than meek to bear;
  And, though herself not unacquaint with care,
  Hath in her heart wide room for all that be,--
  Her heart that hath no secrets of its own,
  But open is as eglantine full blown.
  Cloudless forever is her brow serene,
  Speaking calm hope and trust within her, whence
  Welleth a noiseless spring of patience,
  That keepeth all her life so fresh, so green
  And full of holiness, that every look,
  The greatness of her woman's soul revealing,
  Unto me bringeth blessing, and a feeling
  As when I read in God's own holy book
    A graciousness in giving that doth make
  The small'st gift greatest, and a sense most meek
  Of worthiness, that doth not fear to take
  From others, but which always fears to speak
  Its thanks in utterance, for the giver's sake;--
  The deep religion of a thankful heart,
  Which rests instinctively in Heaven's law
  With a full peace, that never can depart
  From its own steadfastness;--a holy awe
  For holy things,--not those which men call holy,
  But such as are revealÃ¨d to the eyes
  Of a true woman's soul bent down and lowly
  Before the face of daily mysteries;--
  A love that blossoms soon, but ripens slowly
  To the full goldenness of fruitful prime,
  Enduring with a firmness that defies
  All shallow tricks of circumstance and time,
  By a sure insight knowing where to cling,
  And where it clingeth never withering;--
  These are IrenÃ©'s dowry, which no fate
  Can shake from their serene, deep-builded state
    In-seeing sympathy is hers, which chasteneth
  No less than loveth, scorning to be bound
  With fear of blame, and yet which ever hasteneth
  To pour the balm of kind looks on the wound,
  If they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes,
  Giving itself a pang for others' sakes;
  No want of faith, that chills with sidelong eye,
  Hath she; no jealousy, no Levite pride
  That passeth by upon the other side;
  For in her soul there never dwelt a lie.
  Right from the hand of God her spirit came
  Unstained, and she hath ne'er forgotten whence
  It came, nor wandered far from thence,
  But laboreth to keep her still the same,
  Near to her place of birth, that she may not
  Soil her white raiment with an earthly spot
    Yet sets she not her soul so steadily
  Above, that she forgets her ties to earth,
  But her whole thought would almost seem to be
  How to make glad one lowly human hearth;
  For with a gentle courage she doth strive
  In thought and word and feeling so to live
  As to make earth next heaven; and her heart
  Herein doth show its most exceeding worth,
  That, bearing in our frailty her just part,
  She hath not shrunk from evils of this life,
  But hath gone calmly forth into the strife,
  And all its sins and sorrows hath withstood
  With lofty strength of patient womanhood:
  For this I love her great soul more than all,
  That, being bound, like us, with earthly thrall,
  She walks so bright and heaven-like therein,--
  Too wise, too meek, too womanly, to sin
    Like a lone star through riven storm-clouds seen
  By sailors, tempest-toss'd upon the sea,
  Telling of rest and peaceful heavens nigh,
  Unto my soul her star-like soul hath been,
  Her sight as full of hope and calm to me;--
  For she unto herself hath builded high
  A home serene, wherein to lay her head,
  Earth's noblest thing, a Woman perfected
  From the close-shut windows gleams no spark,
  The night is chilly, the night is dark,
  The poplars shiver, the pine-trees moan,
  My hair by the autumn breeze is blown,
  Under thy window I sing alone,
  Alone, alone, ah woe! alone
  The darkness is pressing coldly around,
  The windows shake with a lonely sound,
  The stars are hid and the night is drear,
  The heart of silence throbs in thine ear,
  In thy chamber thou sittest alone,
  Alone, alone, ah woe! alone
  The world is happy, the world is wide,
  Kind hearts are beating on every side;
  Ah, why should we lie so coldly curled
  Alone in the shell of this great world?
  Why should we any more be alone?
  Alone, alone, ah woe! alone
  O, 'tis a bitter and dreary word,
  The saddest by man's ear ever heard!
  We each are young, we each have a heart,
  Why stand we ever coldly apart?
  Must we forever, then, be alone?
  Alone, alone, ah woe! alone
  This little flower from afar
  Hath come from other lands to thine;
  For, once, its white and drooping star
  Could see its shadow in the Rhine
  Perchance some fair-haired German maid
  Hath plucked one from the self-same stalk,
  And numbered over, half afraid,
  Its petals in her evening walk
  "He loves me, loves me not," she cries;
  "He loves me more than earth or heaven!"
  And then glad tears have filled her eyes
  To find the number was uneven
  And thou must count its petals well,
  Because it is a gift from me;
  And the last one of all shall tell
  Something I've often told to thee
  But here at home, where we were born,
  Thou wilt find flowers just as true,
  Down-bending every summer morn
  With freshness of New-England dew
  For Nature, ever kind to love,
  Hath granted them the same sweet tongue,
  Whether with German skies above,
  Or here our granite rocks among
  A beggar, through the world am I,--
  From place to place I wander by.
  Fill up my pilgrim's scrip for me,
  For Christ's sweet sake and charity
  A little of thy steadfastness,
  Rounded with leafy gracefulness,
  Old oak, give me,--
  That the world's blasts may round me blow,
  And I yield gently to and fro,
  While my stout-hearted trunk below
  And firm-set roots unshaken be
  Some of thy stern, unyielding might,
  Enduring still through day and night
  Rude tempest-shock and withering blight,--
  That I may keep at bay
  The changeful April sky of chance
  And the strong tide of circumstance,--
  Give me, old granite gray
  Some of thy pensiveness serene,
  Some of thy never-dying green,
  Put in this scrip of mine,--
  That griefs may fall like snow-flakes light,
  And deck me in a robe of white,
  Ready to be an angel bright,--
  O sweetly-mournful pine
  A little of thy merriment,
  Of thy sparkling, light content,
  Give me, my cheerful brook,--
  That I may still be full of glee
  And gladsomeness, where'er I be,
  Though fickle fate hath prisoned me
  In some neglected nook
  Ye have been very kind and good
  To me, since I've been in the wood;
  Ye have gone nigh to fill my heart;
  But good-bye, kind friends, every one,
  I've far to go ere set of sun;
  Of all good things I would have part,
  The day was high ere I could start,
  And so my journey's scarce begun
  Heaven help me! how could I forget
  To beg of thee, dear violet!
  Some of thy modesty,
  That blossoms here as well, unseen,
  As if before the world thou'dst been,
  O, give, to strengthen me
  Not as all other women are
  Is she that to my soul is dear;
  Her glorious fancies come from far,
  Beneath the silver evening-star,
  And yet her heart is ever near
  Great feelings hath she of her own,
  Which lesser souls may never know;
  God giveth them to her alone,
  And sweet they are as any tone
  Wherewith the wind may choose to blow
  Yet in herself she dwelleth not,
  Although no home were half so fair;
  No simplest duty is forgot,
  Life hath no dim and lowly spot
  That doth not in her sunshine share
  She doeth little kindnesses,
  Which most leave undone, or despise;
  For naught that sets one heart at ease,
  And giveth happiness or peace,
  Is low-esteemÃ¨d in her eyes
  She hath no scorn of common things,
  And, though she seem of other birth,
  Round us her heart entwines and clings,
  And patiently she folds her wings
  To tread the humble paths of earth
  Blessing she is: God made her so,
  And deeds of weekday holiness
  Fall from her noiseless as the snow,
  Nor hath she ever chanced to know
  That aught were easier than to bless
  She is most fair, and thereunto
  Her life doth rightly harmonize;
  Feeling or thought that was not true
  Ne'er made less beautiful the blue
  Unclouded heaven of her eyes
  She is a woman: one in whom
  The spring-time of her childish years
  Hath never lost its fresh perfume,
  Though knowing well that life hath room
  For many blights and many tears
  I love her with a love as still
  As a broad river's peaceful might,
  Which, by high tower and lowly mill,
  Goes wandering at its own will,
  And yet doth ever flow aright
  And, on its full, deep breast serene,
  Like quiet isles my duties lie;
  It flows around them and between,
  And makes them fresh and fair and green,
  Sweet homes wherein to live and die
      Untremulous in the river clear,
  Toward the sky's image, hangs the imaged bridge
      So still the air that I can hear
  The slender clarion of the unseen midge;
      Out of the stillness, with a gathering creep,
  Like rising wind in leaves, which now decreases,
  Now lulls, now swells, and all the while increases,
    The huddling trample of a drove of sheep
  Tilts the loose planks, and then as gradually ceases
    In dust on the other side; life's emblem deep,
  A confused noise between two silences,
  Finding at last in dust precarious peace.
  On the wide marsh the purple-blossomed grasses
    Soak up the sunshine; sleeps the brimming tide
  Save when the wedge-shaped wake in silence passes
    Of some slow water-rat, whose sinuous glide
    Wavers the long green sedge's shade from side to side;
  But up the west, like a rock-shivered surge,
    Climbs a great cloud edged with sun-whitened spray;
  Huge whirls of foam boil toppling o'er its verge,
    And falling still it seems, and yet it climbs alway
      Suddenly all the sky is hid
      As with the shutting of a lid,
    One by one great drops are falling
        Doubtful and slow,
  Down the pane they are crookedly crawling,
        And the wind breathes low;
  Slowly the circles widen on the river,
    Widen and mingle, one and all;
  Here and there the slenderer flowers shiver,
    Struck by an icy rain-drop's fall
  Now on the hills I hear the thunder mutter,
      The wind is gathering in the west;
  The upturned leaves first whiten and flutter,
      Then droop to a fitful rest;
  Up from the stream with sluggish flap
    Struggles the gull and floats away;
  Nearer and nearer rolls the thunder-clap,--
    We shall not see the sun go down to-day:
  Now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh,
    And tramples the grass with terrified feet,
  The startled river turns leaden and harsh.
    You can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat
      Look! look! that livid flash!
  And instantly follows the rattling thunder,
  As if some cloud-crag, split asunder,
      Fell, splintering with a ruinous crash,
  On the Earth, which crouches in silence under;
    And now a solid gray wall of rain
  Shuts off the landscape, mile by mile;
    For a breath's space I see the blue wood again,
  And, ere the next heart-beat, the wind-hurled pile,
    That seemed but now a league aloof,
    Bursts crackling o'er the sun-parched roof;
  Against the windows the storm comes dashing,
  Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing,
        The blue lightning flashes,
        The rapid hail clashes,
      The white waves are tumbling,
        And, in one baffled roar,
      Like the toothless sea mumbling
        A rock-bristled shore,
      The thunder is rumbling
      And crashing and crumbling,--
    Will silence return never more
        Hush! Still as death,
        The tempest holds his breath
      As from a sudden will;
    The rain stops short, but from the eaves
    You see it drop, and hear it from the leaves,
      All is so bodingly still;
        Again, now, now, again
    Plashes the rain in heavy gouts,
        The crinkled lightning
        Seems ever brightening,
          And loud and long
    Again the thunder shouts
          His battle-song,--
        One quivering flash,
        One wildering crash,
    Followed by silence dead and dull,
      As if the cloud, let go,
      Leapt bodily below
  To whelm the earth in one mad overthrow,
      And then a total lull
        Gone, gone, so soon!
      No more my half-crazed fancy there
      Can shape a giant in the air,
      No more I see his streaming hair,
    The writhing portent of his form;--
        The pale and quiet moon
      Makes her calm forehead bare,
    And the last fragments of the storm,
  Like shattered rigging from a fight at sea,
  Silent and few, are drifting over me
  True Love is but a humble, low-born thing,
  And hath its food served up in earthen ware;
  It is a thing to walk with, hand in hand,
  Through the everydayness of this work-day world,
  Baring its tender feet to every roughness,
  Yet letting not one heart-beat go astray
  From Beauty's law of plainness and content.
  A simple, fireside thing, whose quiet smile
  Can warm earth's poorest hovel to a home;
  Which, when our autumn cometh, as it must,
  And life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless,
  Shall still be blest with Indian-summer youth
  In bleak November, and, with thankful heart,
  Smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit,
  As full of sunshine to our aged eyes
  As when it nursed the blossoms of our spring.
  Such is true Love, which steals into the heart
  With feet as silent as the lightsome dawn
  That kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark,
  And hath its will through blissful gentleness,--
  Not like a rocket, which, with savage glare,
  Whirrs suddenly up, then bursts, and leaves the night
  Painfully quivering on the dazÃ¨d eyes;
  A love that gives and takes, that seeth faults,
  Not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle points,
  But loving-kindly ever looks them down
  With the o'ercoming faith of meek forgiveness;
  A love that shall be new and fresh each hour,
  As is the golden mystery of sunset,
  Or the sweet coming of the evening star,
  Alike, and yet most unlike, every day,
  And seeming ever best and fairest _now_;
  A love that doth not kneel for what it seeks,
  But faces Truth and Beauty as their peer,
  Showing its worthiness of noble thoughts
  By a clear sense of inward nobleness;
  A love that in its object findeth not
  All grace and beauty, and enough to sate
  Its thirst of blessing, but, in all of good
  Found there, it sees but Heaven-granted types
  Of good and beauty in the soul of man,
  And traces, in the simplest heart that beats,
  A family-likeness to its chosen one,
  That claims of it the rights of brotherhood.
  For love is blind but with the fleshly eye,
  That so its inner sight may be more clear;
  And outward shows of beauty only so
  Are needful at the first, as is a hand
  To guide and to uphold an infant's steps:
  Great spirits need them not: their earnest look
  Pierces the body's mask of thin disguise,
  And beauty ever is to them revealed,
  Behind the unshapeliest, meanest lump of clay,
  With arms outstretched and eager face ablaze,
  Yearning to be but understood and loved
  Thy voice is like a fountain,
    Leaping up in clear moonshine;
  Silver, silver, ever mounting,
      Ever sinking,
      Without thinking,
    To that brimful heart of thine
  Every sad and happy feeling,
  Thou hast had in bygone years,
  Through thy lips come stealing, stealing,
        Clear and low;
    All thy smiles and all thy tears
      In thy voice awaken,
      And sweetness, wove of joy and woe,
        From their teaching it hath taken
    Feeling and music move together,
    Like a swan and shadow ever
    Heaving on a sky-blue river
    In a day of cloudless weather
    It hath caught a touch of sadness,
        Yet it is not sad;
    It hath tones of clearest gladness,
        Yet it is not glad;
  A dim, sweet, twilight voice it is
    Where to-day's accustomed blue
  Is over-grayed with memories,
    With starry feelings quivered through
    Thy voice is like a fountain
  Leaping up in sunshine bright,
    And I never weary counting
  Its clear droppings, lone and single,
  Or when in one full gush they mingle,
    Shooting in melodious light
    Thine is music such as yields
    Feelings of old brooks and fields,
    And, around this pent-up room,
    Sheds a woodland, free perfume;
      O, thus forever sing to me!
        O, thus forever!
  The green, bright grass of childhood bring to me,
    Flowing like an emerald river,
    And the bright blue skies above!
    O, sing them back, as fresh as ever,
    Into the bosom of my love,--
    The sunshine and the merriment,
    The unsought, evergreen content,
      Of that never cold time,
    The joy, that, like a clear breeze, went
      Through and through the old time
    Peace sits within thine eyes,
    With white hands crossed in joyful rest,
    While, through thy lips and face, arise
    The melodies from out thy breast;
        She sits and sings,
        With folded wings
        And white arms crost,
     "Weep not for passed things,
        They are not lost:
    The beauty which the summer time
    O'er thine opening spirit shed,
    The forest oracles sublime
    That filled thy soul with joyous dread,
    The scent of every smallest flower
    That made thy heart sweet for an hour,--
    Yea, every holy influence,
    Flowing to thee, thou knewest not whence,
    In thine eyes to-day is seen,
    Fresh as it hath ever been;
    Promptings of Nature, beckonings sweet,
    Whatever led thy childish feet,
    Still will linger unawares
    The guiders of thy silver hairs;
    Every look and every word
    Which thou givest forth to-day,
    Tell of the singing of the bird
    Whose music stilled thy boyish play
    Thy voice is like a fountain,
    Twinkling up in sharp starlight,
    When the moon behind the mountain
    Dims the low East with faintest white,
        Ever darkling,
        Ever sparkling,
    We know not if 'tis dark or bright;
  But, when the great moon hath rolled round,
    And, sudden-slow, its solemn power
  Grows from behind its black, clear-edged bound,
    No spot of dark the fountain keepeth,
    But, swift as opening eyelids, leapeth
    Into a waving silver flower
    My soul was like the sea,
    Before the moon was made,
  Moaning in vague immensity,
    Of its own strength afraid,
    Unrestful and unstaid
  Through every rift it foamed in vain,
    About its earthly prison,
  Seeking some unknown thing in pain,
  And sinking restless back again,
    For yet no moon had risen:
  Its only voice a vast dumb moan,
    Of utterless anguish speaking,
  It lay unhopefully alone,
    And lived but in an aimless seeking
  So was my soul; but when'twas full
    Of unrest to o'erloading,
  A voice of something beautiful
    Whispered a dim foreboding,
  And yet so soft, so sweet, so low,
  It had not more of joy than woe;
  And, as the sea doth oft lie still,
    Making its waters meet,
  As if by an unconscious will,
    For the moon's silver feet,
  So lay my soul within mine eyes
  When thou, its guardian moon, didst rise.
  And now, howe'er its waves above
    May toss and seem uneaseful,
  One strong, eternal law of Love,
    With guidance sure and peaceful,
  As calm and natural as breath,
  Moves its great deeps through life and death
  Thick-rushing, like an ocean vast
    Of bisons the far prairie shaking,
  The notes crowd heavily and fast
  As surfs, one plunging while the last
    Draws seaward from its foamy breaking
  Or in low murmurs they began,
    Rising and rising momently,
  As o'er a harp Ãolian
  A fitful breeze, until they ran
    Up to a sudden ecstasy
  And then, like minute drops of rain
    Ringing in water silvery,
  They lingering dropped and dropped again,
  Till it was almost like a pain
    To listen when the next would be
  A lily thou wast when I saw thee first,
    A lily-bud not opened quite,
    That hourly grew more pure and white,
  By morning, and noontide, and evening nursed:
    In all of nature thou hadst thy share;
      Thou wast waited on
      By the wind and sun;
    The rain and the dew for thee took care;
    It seemed thou never couldst be more fair
  A lily thou wast when I saw thee first,
    A lily-bud; but O, how strange,
    How full of wonder was the change,
  When, ripe with all sweetness, thy full bloom burst!
    How did the tears to my glad eyes start,
      When the woman-flower
      Reached its blossoming hour,
  And I saw the warm deeps of thy golden heart
  Glad death may pluck thee, but never before
    The gold dust of thy bloom divine
    Hath dropped from thy heart into mine,
  To quicken its faint germs of heavenly lore;
    For no breeze comes nigh thee but carries away
      Some impulses bright
      Of fragrance and light,
  Which fall upon souls that are lone and astray,
  To plant fruitful hopes of the flower of day
  I would more natures were like thine,
    That never casts a glance before,--
  Thou Hebe, who thy heart's bright wine
    So lavishly to all dost pour,
  That we who drink forget to pine,
    And can but dream of bliss in store
  Thou canst not see a shade in life;
    With sunward instinct thou dost rise,
  And, leaving clouds below at strife,
    Gazest undazzled at the skies,
  With all their blazing splendors rife,
    A songful lark with eagle's eyes
  Thou wast some foundling whom the Hours
    Nursed, laughing, with the milk of Mirth;
  Some influence more gay than ours
    Hath ruled thy nature from its birth,
  As if thy natal stars were flowers
    That shook their seeds round thee on earth
  And thou, to lull thine infant rest,
    Wast cradled like an Indian child;
  All pleasant winds from south and west
    With lullabies thine ears beguiled,
  Rocking thee in thine oriole's nest,
    Till Nature looked at thee and smiled
  Thine every fancy seems to borrow
    A sunlight from thy childish years,
  Making a golden cloud of sorrow,
    A hope-lit rainbow out of tears,--
  Thy heart is certain of to-morrow,
    Though 'yond to-day it never peers
  I would more natures were like thine,
    So innocently wild and free,
  Whose sad thoughts, even, leap and shine,
    Like sunny wavelets in the sea,
  Making us mindless of the brine,
    In gazing on the brilliancy
  Into the sunshine,
    Full of the light,
  Leaping and flashing
    From morn till night
  Into the moonlight,
    Whiter than snow,
  Waving so flower-like
    When the winds blow
  Into the starlight,
    Rushing in spray,
  Happy at midnight,
    Happy by day
  Ever in motion,
    Blithesome and cheery.
  Still climbing heavenward,
    Never aweary
  Glad of all weathers,
    Still seeming best,
  Upward or downward,
    Motion thy rest
  Full of a nature
    Nothing can tame,
  Changed every moment,
    Ever the same
  Ceaseless aspiring,
    Ceaseless content,
  Darkness or sunshine
    Thy element
  Glorious fountain!
    Let my heart be
  Fresh, changeful, constant,
    Upward, like thee
  In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder,
    The Poet's song with blood-warm truth was rife;
  He saw the mysteries which circle under
    The outward shell and skin of daily life.
  Nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion,
    His soul was led by the eternal law;
  There was in him no hope of fame, no passion,
    But, with calm, god-like eyes, he only saw.
  He did not sigh o'er heroes dead and buried,
    Chief-mourner at the Golden Age's hearse,
  Nor deem that souls whom Charon grim had ferried
    Alone were fitting themes of epic verse:
  He could believe the promise of to-morrow,
    And feel the wondrous meaning of to-day;
  He had a deeper faith in holy sorrow
    Than the world's seeming loss could take away.
  To know the heart of all things was his duty,
    All things did sing to him to make him wise,
  And, with a sorrowful and conquering beauty,
    The soul of all looked grandly from his eyes.
  He gazed on all within him and without him,
    He watched the flowing of Time's steady tide,
  And shapes of glory floated all about him
    And whispered to him, and he prophesied.
  Than all men he more fearless was and freer,
    And all his brethren cried with one accord,--
  "Behold the holy man! Behold the Seer!
    Him who hath spoken with the unseen Lord!"
  He to his heart with large embrace had taken
    The universal sorrow of mankind,
  And, from that root, a shelter never shaken,
    The tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind.
  He could interpret well the wondrous voices
    Which to the calm and silent spirit come;
  He knew that the One Soul no more rejoices
    In the star's anthem than the insect's hum.
  He in his heart was ever meek and humble,
    And yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran,
  As he foresaw how all things false should crumble
    Before the free, uplifted soul of man:
  And, when he was made full to overflowing
    With all the loveliness of heaven and earth,
  Out rushed his song, like molten iron glowing,
    To show God sitting by the humblest hearth.
  With calmest courage he was ever ready
    To teach that action was the truth of thought,
  And, with strong arm and purpose firm and steady,
    An anchor for the drifting world he wrought.
  So did he make the meanest man partaker
    Of all his brother-gods unto him gave;
  All souls did reverence him and name him Maker,
    And when he died heaped temples on his grave.
  And still his deathless words of light are swimming
    Serene throughout the great, deep infinite
  Of human soul, unwaning and undimming,
    To cheer and guide the mariner at night
  But now the Poet is an empty rhymer
    Who lies with idle elbow on the grass,
  And fits his singing, like a cunning timer,
    To all men's prides and fancies as they pass.
  Not his the song, which, in its metre holy,
    Chimes with the music of the eternal stars,
  Humbling the tyrant, lifting up the lowly,
    And sending sun through the soul's prison-bars.
  Maker no more,--O, no! unmaker rather,
    For he unmakes who doth not all put forth
  The power given by our loving Father
    To show the body's dross, the spirit's worth.
  Awake! great spirit of the ages olden!
    Shiver the mists that hide thy starry lyre,
  And let man's soul be yet again beholden
    To thee for wings to soar to her desire.
  O, prophesy no more to-morrow's splendor,
    Be no more shame-faced to speak out for Truth,
  Lay on her altar all the gushings tender,
    The hope, the fire, the loving faith of youth!
  O, prophesy no more the Maker's coming,
    Say not his onward footsteps thou canst hear
  In the dim void, like to the awful humming
    Of the great wings of some new-lighted sphere.
  O, prophesy no more, but be the Poet!
    This longing was but granted unto thee
  That, when all beauty thou couldst feel and know it,
    That beauty in its highest thou couldst be.
  O, thou who moanest tost with sea-like longings,
    Who dimly hearest voices call on thee,
  Whose soul is overfilled with mighty throngings
    Of love, and fear, and glorious agony,
  Thou of the toil-strung hands and iron sinews
    And soul by Mother-Earth with freedom fed,
  In whom the hero-spirit yet continues,
    The old free nature is not chained or dead,
  Arouse! let thy soul break in music-thunder,
    Let loose the ocean that is in thee pent,
  Pour forth thy hope, thy fear, thy love, thy wonder
    And tell the age what all its signs have meant,
  Where'er thy wildered crowd of brethren jostles,
    Where'er there lingers but a shade of wrong,
  There still is need of martyrs and apostles,
    There still are texts for never-dying song:
  From age to age man's still aspiring spirit
    Finds wider scope and sees with clearer eyes,
  And thou in larger measure dost inherit
    What made thy great forerunners free and wise.
  Sit thou enthroned where the Poet's mountain
    Above the thunder lifts its silent peak,
  And roll thy songs down like a gathering fountain,
    That all may drink and find the rest they seek.
  Sing! there shall silence grow in earth and heaven,
    A silence of deep awe and wondering;
  For, listening gladly, bend the angels, even,
    To hear a mortal like an angel sing
  Among the toil-worn poor my soul is seeking
    For one to bring the Maker's name to light,
  To be the voice of that almighty speaking
    Which every age demands to do it right.
  Proprieties our silken bards environ;
    He who would be the tongue of this wide land
  Must string his harp with chords of sturdy iron
    And strike it with a toil-embrownÃ¨d hand;
  One who hath dwelt with Nature well-attended,
    Who hath learnt wisdom from her mystic books,
  Whose soul with all her countless lives hath blended,
    So that all beauty awes us in his looks;
  Who not with body's waste his soul hath pampered,
    Who as the clear northwestern wind is free,
  Who walks with Form's observances unhampered,
    And follows the One Will obediently;
  Whose eyes, like windows on a breezy summit,
    Control a lovely prospect every way;
  Who doth not sound God's sea with earthly plummet,
    And find a bottom still of worthless clay;
  Who heeds not how the lower gusts are working,
    Knowing that one sure wind blows on above,
  And sees, beneath the foulest faces lurking,
    One God-built shrine of reverence and love;
  Who sees all stars that wheel their shining marches
    Around the centre fixed of Destiny,
  Where the encircling soul serene o'erarches
    The moving globe of being like a sky;
  Who feels that God and Heaven's great deeps are nearer
    Him to whose heart his fellow-man is nigh,
  Who doth not hold his soul's own freedom dearer
    Than that of all his brethren, low or high;
  Who to the Right can feel himself the truer
    For being gently patient with the wrong,
  Who sees a brother in the evil-doer,
    And finds in Love the heart's-blood of his song;--
  This, this is he for whom the world is waiting
    To sing the beatings of its mighty heart,
  Too long hath it been patient with the grating
    Of scrannel-pipes, and heard it misnamed Art.
  To him the smiling soul of man shall listen,
    Laying awhile its crown of thorns aside,
  And once again in every eye shall glisten
    The glory of a nature satisfied.
  His verse shall have a great, commanding motion,
    Heaving and swelling with a melody
  Learnt of the sky, the river, and the ocean,
    And all the pure, majestic things that be.
  Awake, then, thou! we pine for thy great presence
    To make us feel the soul once more sublime,
  We are of far too infinite an essence
    To rest contented with the lies of Time.
  Speak out! and, lo! a hush of deepest wonder
    Shall sink o'er all this many-voicÃ¨d scene,
  As when a sudden burst of rattling thunder
    Shatters the blueness of a sky serene
  Where is the true man's fatherland?
    Is it where he by chance is born?
    Doth not the yearning spirit scorn
  In such scant borders to be spanned?
  O, yes! his fatherland must be
  As the blue heaven wide and free
  Is it alone where freedom is,
    Where God is God and man is man?
    Doth he not claim a broader span
  For the soul's love of home than this?
  O, yes! his fatherland must be
  As the blue heaven wide and free
  Where'er a human heart doth wear
    Joy's myrtle-wreath or sorrow's gyves,
    Where'er a human spirit strives
  After a life more true and fair,
  There is the true man's birthplace grand,
  His is a world-wide fatherland
  Where'er a single slave doth pine,
    Where'er one man may help another,--
    Thank God for such a birthright, brother,--
  That spot of earth is thine and mine!
  There is the true man's birthplace grand,
  His is a world-wide fatherland
  The night is dark, the stinging sleet,
    Swept by the bitter gusts of air,
  Drives whistling down the lonely street,
    And stiffens on the pavement bare
  The street-lamps flare and struggle dim
    Through the white sleet-clouds as they pass,
  Or, governed by a boisterous whim,
    Drop down and rattle on the glass
  One poor, heart-broken, outcast girl
    Faces the east-wind's searching flaws,
  And, as about her heart they whirl,
    Her tattered cloak more tightly draws
  The flat brick walls look cold and bleak,
    Her bare feet to the sidewalk freeze;
  Yet dares she not a shelter seek,
    Though faint with hunger and disease
  The sharp storm cuts her forehead bare,
    And, piercing through her garments thin,
  Beats on her shrunken breast, and there
    Makes colder the cold heart within
  She lingers where a ruddy glow
    Streams outward through an open shutter,
  Adding more bitterness to woe,
    More loneness to desertion utter
  One half the cold she had not felt,
    Until she saw this gush of light
  Spread warmly forth, and seem to melt
    Its slow way through the deadening night
  She hears a woman's voice within,
    Singing sweet words her childhood knew,
  And years of misery and sin
    Furl off, and leave her heaven blue
  Her freezing heart, like one who sinks
    Outwearied in the drifting snow,
  Drowses to deadly sleep and thinks
    No longer of its hopeless woe
  Old fields, and clear blue summer days,
    Old meadows, green with grass and trees
  That shimmer through the trembling haze
    And whiten in the western breeze
  Old faces,--all the friendly past
    Rises within her heart again,
  And sunshine from her childhood cast
    Makes summer of the icy rain
  Enhaloed by a mild, warm glow,
    From all humanity apart,
  She hears old footsteps wandering slow
    Through the lone chambers of her heart
  Outside the porch before the door,
    Her cheek upon the cold, hard stone,
  She lies, no longer foul and poor,
    No longer dreary and alone
  Next morning something heavily
    Against the opening door did weigh,
  And there, from sin and sorrow free,
    A woman on the threshold lay
  A smile upon the wan lips told
    That she had found a calm release,
  And that, from out the want and cold,
    The song had borne her soul in peace
  For, whom the heart of man shuts out,
    Sometimes the heart of God takes in,
  And fences them all round about
    With silence mid the world's loud din
  And one of his great charities
    Is Music, and it doth not scorn
  To close the lids upon the eyes
    Of the polluted and forlorn
  Far was she from her childhood's home,
    Farther in guilt had wandered thence,
  Yet thither it had bid her come
    To die in maiden innocence
  The moon shines white and silent
    On the mist, which, like a tide
  Of some enchanted ocean,
    O'er the wide marsh doth glide,
  Spreading its ghost-like billows
    Silently far and wide
  A vague and starry magic
    Makes all things mysteries,
  And lures the earth's dumb spirit
    Up to the longing skies,--
  I seem to hear dim whispers,
    And tremulous replies
  The fireflies o'er the meadow
    In pulses come and go;
  The elm-trees' heavy shadow
    Weighs on the grass below;
  And faintly from the distance
    The dreaming cock doth crow
  All things look strange and mystic,
    The very bushes swell
  And take wild shapes and motions,
    As if beneath a spell,--
  They seem not the same lilacs
    From childhood known so well
  The snow of deepest silence
    O'er everything doth fall,
  So beautiful and quiet,
    And yet so like a pall,--
  As if all life were ended,
    And rest were come to all
  O wild and wondrous midnight,
    There is a might in thee
  To make the charmÃ¨d body
    Almost like spirit be,
  And give it some faint glimpses
    Of immortality
  God! do not let my loved one die,
    But rather wait until the time
  That I am grown in purity
    Enough to enter thy pure clime
  Then take me, I will gladly go,
    So that my love remain below
  O, let her stay! She is by birth
    What I through death must learn to be,
  We need her more on our poor earth,
    Than thou canst need in heaven with thee;
  She hath her wings already, I
  Must burst this earth-shell ere I fly
  Then, God, take me! We shall be near,
    More near than ever, each to each:
  Her angel ears will find more clear
    My heavenly than my earthly speech;
  And still, as I draw nigh to thee,
  Her soul and mine shall closer be
  The rich man's son inherits lands,
    And piles of brick, and stone, and gold,
  And he inherits soft white hands,
    And tender flesh that fears the cold,
    Nor dares to wear a garment old;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  One scarce would wish to hold in fee
  The rich man's son inherits cares;
    The bank may break, the factory burn,
  A breath may burst his bubble shares,
    And soft white hands could hardly earn
    A living that would serve his turn;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  One scarce would wish to hold in fee
  The rich man's son inherits wants,
    His stomach craves for dainty fare;
  With sated heart, he hears the pants
    Of toiling hinds with brown arms bare,
    And wearies in his easy chair;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  One scarce would wish to hold in fee
  What doth the poor man's son inherit?
    Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,
  A hardy frame, a hardier spirit;
    King of two hands, he does his part
    In every useful toil and art;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  A king might wish to hold in fee
  What doth the poor man's son inherit?
    Wishes o'erjoyed with humble things,
  A rank adjudged by toil-won merit,
    Content that from employment springs,
    A heart that in his labor sings;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  A king might wish to hold in fee
  What doth the poor man's son inherit?
    A patience learned of being poor,
  Courage, if sorrow come, to bear it,
    A fellow-feeling that is sure
    To make the outcast bless his door;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  A king might wish to hold in fee
  O, rich man's son! there is a toil,
    That with all others level stands;
  Large charity doth never soil,
    But only whiten, soft white hands,--
    This is the best crop from thy lands;
  A heritage, it seems to be,
  Worth being rich to hold in fee
  O, poor man's son! scorn not thy state;
    There is worse weariness than thine,
  In merely being rich and great;
    Toil only gives the soul to shine,
    And makes rest fragrant and benign,
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  Worth being poor to hold in fee
  Both, heirs to some six feet of sod,
    Are equal in the earth at last;
  Both, children of the same dear God,
    Prove title to your heirship vast
    By record of a well-filled past;
  A heritage, it seems to me,
  Well worth a life to hold in fee
  In his tower sat the poet
    Gazing on the roaring sea,
  "Take this rose," he sighed, "and throw it
    Where there's none that loveth me.
  On the rock the billow bursteth
    And sinks back into the seas,
  But in vain my spirit thirsteth
    So to burst and be at ease.
  Take, O, sea! the tender blossom
    That hath lain against my breast;
  On thy black and angry bosom
    It will find a surer rest.
  Life is vain, and love is hollow,
    Ugly death stands there behind,
  Hate and scorn and hunger follow
    Him that toileth for his kind."
  Forth into the night he hurled it,
    And with bitter smile did mark
  How the surly tempest whirled it
    Swift into the hungry dark.
  Foam and spray drive back to leeward,
    And the gale, with dreary moan,
  Drifts the helpless blossom seaward,
    Through the breakers all alone
  Stands a maiden, on the morrow,
    Musing by the wave-beat strand,
  Half in hope and half in sorrow,
    Tracing words upon the sand:
  "Shall I ever then behold him
    Who hath been my life so long,--
  Ever to this sick heart fold him,--
    Be the spirit of his song?
  Touch not, sea, the blessed letters
    I have traced upon thy shore,
  Spare his name whose spirit fetters
    Mine with love forevermore!"
  Swells the tide and overflows it,
    But, with omen pure and meet,
  Brings a little rose, and throws it
    Humbly at the maiden's feet.
  Full of bliss she takes the token,
    And, upon her snowy breast,
  Soothes the ruffled petals broken
    With the ocean's fierce unrest.
  "Love is thine, O heart! and surely
    Peace shall also be thine own,
  For the heart that trusteth purely
    Never long can pine alone
  In his tower sits the poet,
    Blisses new and strange to him
  Fill his heart and overflow it
    With a wonder sweet and dim.
  Up the beach the ocean slideth
    With a whisper of delight,
  And the noon in silence glideth
    Through the peaceful blue of night.
  Rippling o'er the poet's shoulder
    Flows a maiden's golden hair,
  Maiden-lips, with love grown bolder,
    Kiss his moon-lit forehead bare.
  "Life is joy, and love is power,
    Death all fetters doth unbind,
  Strength and wisdom only flower
    When we toil for all our kind.
  Hope is truth,--the future giveth
    More than present takes away,
  And the soul forever liveth
    Nearer God from day to day."
  Not a word the maiden uttered,
    Fullest hearts are slow to speak,
  But a withered rose-leaf fluttered
    Down upon the poet's cheek
  Fair as a summer dream was Margaret,--
    Such dream as in a poet's soul might start,
  Musing of old loves while the moon doth set:
    Her hair was not more sunny than her heart,
  Though like a natural golden coronet
    It circled her dear head with careless art,
  Mocking the sunshine, that would fain have lent
  To its frank grace a richer ornament
  His loved one's eyes could poet ever speak,
    So kind, so dewy, and so deep were hers,--
  But, while he strives, the choicest phrase, too weak
    Their glad reflection in his spirit blurs;
  As one may see a dream dissolve and break
    Out of his grasp when he to tell it stirs,
  Like that sad Dryad doomed no more to bless
  The mortal who revealed her loveliness
  She dwelt forever in a region bright,
    Peopled with living fancies of her own,
  Where naught could come but visions of delight,
    Far, far aloof from earth's eternal moan:
  A summer cloud thrilled through with rosy light,
    Floating beneath the blue sky all alone,
  Her spirit wandered by itself, and won
  A golden edge from some unsetting sun
  The heart grows richer that its lot is poor,--
    God blesses want with larger sympathies,--
  Love enters gladliest at the humble door,
    And makes the cot a palace with his eyes;
  So Margaret's heart a softer beauty wore,
    And grew in gentleness and patience wise,
  For she was but a simple herdsman's child,
  A lily chance-sown in the rugged wild
  There was no beauty of the wood or field
    But she its fragrant bosom-secret knew,
  Nor any but to her would freely yield
    Some grace that in her soul took root and grew:
  Nature to her glowed ever new-revealed,
    All rosy fresh with innocent morning dew,
  And looked into her heart with dim, sweet eyes
  That left it full of sylvan memories
  O, what a face was hers to brighten light,
    And give back sunshine with an added glow,
  To wile each moment with a fresh delight,
    And part of memory's best contentment grow!
  O, how her voice, as with an inmate's right,
    Into the strangest heart would welcome go,
  And make it sweet, and ready to become
  Of white and gracious thoughts the chosen home
  None looked upon her but he straightway thought
    Of all the greenest depths of country cheer,
  And into each one's heart was freshly brought
    What was to him the sweetest time of year,
  So was her every look and motion fraught
    With out-of-door delights and forest lere:
  Not the first violet on a woodland lea
  Seemed a more visible gift of Spring than she
  Is love learned only out of poets' books?
    Is there not somewhat in the dropping flood,
  And in the nunneries of silent nooks,
    And in the murmured longing of the wood,
  That could make Margaret dream of lovelorn looks,
    And stir a thrilling mystery in her blood
  More trembly secret than Aurora's tear
  Shed in the bosom of an eglatere
  Full many a sweet forewarning hath the mind,
    Full many a whispering of vague desire,
  Ere comes the nature destined to unbind
    Its virgin zone, and all its deeps inspire,--
  Low stirrings in the leaves, before the wind
    Wakes all the green strings of the forest lyre,
  Faint heatings in the calyx, ere the rose
  Its warm voluptuous breast doth all unclose
  Long in its dim recesses pines the spirit,
    Wildered and dark, despairingly alone;
  Though many a shape of beauty wander near it,
    And many a wild and half-remembered tone
  Tremble from the divine abyss to cheer it,
    Yet still it knows that there is only one
  Before whom it can kneel and tribute bring,
  At once a happy vassal and a king
  To feel a want, yet scarce know what it is,
    To seek one nature that is always new,
  Whose glance is warmer than another's kiss,
    Whom we can bare our inmost beauty to,
  Nor feel deserted afterwards,--for this
    But with our destined co-mate we can do,--
  Such longing instinct fills the mighty scope
  Of the young soul with one mysterious hope
  So Margaret's heart grew brimming with the lore
    Of love's enticing secrets; and although
  She had found none to cast it down before,
    Yet oft to Fancy's chapel she would go
  To pay her vows, and count the rosary o'er
    Of her love's promised graces:--haply so
  Miranda's hope had pictured Ferdinand
  Long ere the gaunt wave tossed him on the strand
  A new-made star that swims the lonely gloom,
    Unwedded yet and longing for the sun,
  Whose beams, the bride-gifts of the lavish groom
    Blithely to crown the virgin planet run,
  Her being was, watching to see the bloom
    Of love's fresh sunrise roofing one by one
  Its clouds with gold, a triumph-arch to be
  For him who came to hold her heart in fee
  Not far from Margaret's cottage dwelt a knight
    Of the proud Templars, a sworn celibate,
  Whose heart in secret fed upon the light
    And dew of her ripe beauty, through the grate
  Of his close vow catching what gleams he might
    Of the free heaven, and cursing--all too late--
  The cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in,
  And turned life's crowning bliss to deadly sin
  For he had met her in the wood by chance,
    And, having drunk her beauty's wildering spell,
  His heart shook like the pennon of a lance
    That quivers in a breeze's sudden swell,
  And thenceforth, in a close-enfolded trance,
    From mistily golden deep to deep he fell;
  Till earth did waver and fade far away
  Beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay
  A dark, proud man he was, whose half-blown youth
    Had shed its blossoms even in opening,
  Leaving a few that with more winning ruth
    Trembling around grave manhood's stem might cling,
  More sad than cheery, making, in good sooth,
    Like the fringed gentian, a late autumn spring:--
  A twilight nature, braided light and gloom,
  A youth half-smiling by an open tomb
  Fair as an angel, who yet inly wore
    A wrinkled heart foreboding his near fall;
  Who saw him always wished to know him more,
    As if he were some fate's defiant thrall
  And nursed a dreaded secret at its core;
    Little he loved, but power most of all,
  And that he seemed to scorn, as one who knew
  By what foul paths men choose to crawl thereto
  He had been noble, but some great deceit
    Had turned his better instinct to a vice:
  He strove to think the world was all a cheat,
    That power and fame were cheap at any price,
  That the sure way of being shortly great
    Was even to play life's game with loaded dice,
  Since he had tried the honest play and found
  That vice and virtue differed but in sound
  Yet Margaret's sight redeemed him for a space
    From his own thraldom; man could never be
  A hypocrite when first such maiden grace
    Smiled in upon his heart; the agony
  Of wearing all day long a lying face
    Fell lightly from him, and, a moment free,
  Erect with wakened faith his spirit stood
  And scorned the weakness of its demon-mood
  Like a sweet wind-harp to him was her thought,
    Which would not let the common air come near,
  Till from its dim enchantment it had caught
    A musical tenderness that brimmed his ear
  With sweetness more ethereal than aught
    Save silver-dropping snatches that whilere
  Rained down from some sad angel's faithful harp
  To cool her fallen lover's anguish sharp
  Deep in the forest was a little dell
    High overarchÃ¨d with the leafy sweep
  Of a broad oak, through whose gnarled roots there fell
    A slender rill that sung itself asleep,
  Where its continuous toil had scooped a well
    To please the fairy folk; breathlessly deep
  The stillness was, save when the dreaming brook
  From its small urn a drizzly murmur shook
  The wooded hills sloped upward all around
    With gradual rise, and made an even rim,
  So that it seemed a mighty casque unbound
    From some huge Titan's brow to lighten him,
  Ages ago, and left upon the ground,
    Where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim,
  Till after countless centuries it grew
  Into this dell, the haunt of noontide dew
  Dim vistas, sprinkled o'er with sun-flecked green,
    Wound through the thickset trunks on every side,
  And, toward the west, in fancy might be seen
    A gothic window in its blazing pride,
  When the low sun, two arching elms between,
    Lit up the leaves beyond, which, autumn-dyed
  With lavish hues, would into splendor start,
  Shaming the labored panes of richest art
  Here, leaning once against the old oak's trunk,
    Mordred, for such was the young Templar's name,
  Saw Margaret come; unseen, the falcon shrunk
    From the meek dove; sharp thrills of tingling flame
  Made him forget that he was vowed a monk,
    And all the outworks of his pride o'ercame:
  Flooded he seemed with bright delicious pain,
  As if a star had burst within his brain
  Such power hath beauty and frank innocence:
    A flower bloomed forth, that sunshine glad to bless,
  Even from his love's long leafless stem; the sense
    Of exile from Hope's happy realm grew less,
  And thoughts of childish peace, he knew not whence,
    Thronged round his heart with many an old caress,
  Melting the frost there into pearly dew
  That mirrored back his nature's morning-blue
  She turned and saw him, but she felt no dread,
    Her purity, like adamantine mail,
  Did so encircle her; and yet her head
    She drooped, and made her golden hair her veil,
  Through which a glow of rosiest lustre spread,
    Then faded, and anon she stood all pale,
  As snow o'er which a blush of northern-light
  Suddenly reddens, and as soon grows white
  She thought of Tristrem and of Lancilot,
    Of all her dreams, and of kind fairies' might,
  And how that dell was deemed a haunted spot,
    Until there grew a mist before her sight,
  And where the present was she half forgot,
    Borne backward through the realms of old delight,--
  Then, starting up awake, she would have gone,
  Yet almost wished it might not be alone
  How they went home together through the wood,
    And how all life seemed focussed into one
  Thought-dazzling spot that set ablaze the blood,
    What need to tell? Fit language there is none
  For the heart's deepest things. Who ever wooed
    As in his boyish hope he would have done?
  For, when the soul is fullest, the hushed tongue
  Voicelessly trembles like a lute unstrung
  But all things carry the heart's messages
    And know it not, nor doth the heart well know,
  But nature hath her will; even as the bees,
    Blithe go-betweens, fly singing to and fro
  With the fruit-quickening pollen;--hard if these
    Found not some all unthought-of way to show
  Their secret each to each; and so they did,
  And one heart's flower-dust into the other slid
  Young hearts are free; the selfish world it is
    That turns them miserly and cold as stone,
  And makes them clutch their fingers on the bliss
    Which but in giving truly is their own;--
  She had no dreams of barter, asked not his,
    But gave hers freely as she would have thrown
  A rose to him, or as that rose gives forth
  Its generous fragrance, thoughtless of its worth
  Her summer nature felt a need to bless,
    And a like longing to be blest again;
  So, from her sky-like spirit, gentleness
    Dropt ever like a sunlit fall of rain,
  And his beneath drank in the bright caress
    As thirstily as would a parchÃ¨d plain,
  That long hath watched the showers of sloping gray
  Forever, ever, falling far away
  How should she dream of ill? the heart filled quite
    With sunshine, like the shepherd's-clock at noon,
  Closes its leaves around its warm delight;
    Whate'er in life is harsh or out of tune
  Is all shut out, no boding shade of light
    Can pierce the opiate ether of its swoon:
  Love is but blind as thoughtful justice is,
  But naught can be so wanton-blind as bliss
  All beauty and all life he was to her;
    She questioned not his love, she only knew
  That she loved him, and not a pulse could stir
    In her whole frame but quivered through and through
  With this glad thought, and was a minister
    To do him fealty and service true,
  Like golden ripples hasting to the land
  To wreck their freight of sunshine on the strand
  O dewy dawn of love! O hopes that are
  Hung high, like the cliff-swallow's perilous nest,
  Most like to fall when fullest, and that jar
  With every heavier billow! O unrest
  Than balmiest deeps of quiet sweeter far!
  How did ye triumph now in Margaret's breast,
  Making it readier to shrink and start
  Than quivering gold of the pond-lily's heart
  Here let us pause: O, would the soul might ever
    Achieve its immortality in youth,
  When nothing yet hath damped its high endeavor
    After the starry energy of truth!
  Here let us pause, and for a moment sever
    This gleam of sunshine from the days unruth
  That sometime come to all, for it is good
  To lengthen to the last a sunny mood
  As one who, from the sunshine and the green,
    Enters the solid darkness of a cave,
  Nor knows what precipice or pit unseen
    May yawn before him with its sudden grave,
  And, with hushed breath, doth often forward lean,
    Dreaming he hears the plashing of a wave
  Dimly below, or feels a damper air
  From out some dreary chasm, he knows not where
  So, from the sunshine and the green of love,
    We enter on our story's darker part;
  And, though the horror of it well may move
    An impulse of repugnance in the heart,
  Yet let us think, that, as there's naught above
    The all-embracing atmosphere of Art,
  So also there is naught that falls below
  Her generous reach, though grimed with guilt and woe
  Her fittest triumph is to show that good
    Lurks in the heart of evil evermore,
  That love, though scorned, and outcast, and withstood,
    Can without end forgive, and yet have store;
  God's love and man's are of the self-same blood,
    And He can see that always at the door
  Of foulest hearts the angel-nature yet
  Knocks to return and cancel all its debt
  It ever is weak falsehood's destiny
    That her thick mask turns crystal to let through
  The unsuspicious eyes of honesty;
    But Margaret's heart was too sincere and true
  Aught but plain truth and faithfulness to see,
    And Mordred's for a time a little grew
  To be like hers, won by the mild reproof
  Of those kind eyes that kept all doubt aloof
  Full oft they met, as dawn and twilight meet
    In northern climes; she full of growing day
  As he of darkness, which before her feet
    Shrank gradual, and faded quite away,
  Soon to return; for power had made love sweet
    To him, and, when his will had gained full sway,
  The taste began to pall; for never power
  Can sate the hungry soul beyond an hour
  He fell as doth the tempter ever fall,
    Even in the gaining of his loathsome end;
  God doth not work as man works, but makes all
    The crooked paths of ill to goodness tend;
  Let him judge Margaret! If to be the thrall
    Of love, and faith too generous to defend
  Its very life from him she loved, be sin,
  What hope of grace may the seducer win
  Grim-hearted world, that look'st with Levite eyes
    On those poor fallen by too much faith in man.
  She that upon thy freezing threshold lies,
    Starved to more sinning by thy savage ban,--
  Seeking that refuge because foulest vice
    More god-like than thy virtue is, whose span
  Shuts out the wretched only,--is more free
  To enter Heaven than thou wilt ever be
  Thou wilt not let her wash thy dainty feet
    With such salt things as tears, or with rude hair
  Dry them, soft Pharisee, that sit'st at meat
    With him who made her such, and speak'st him fair,
  Leaving God's wandering lamb the while to bleat
    Unheeded, shivering in the pitiless air:
  Thou hast made prisoned virtue show more wan
  And haggard than a vice to look upon
  Now many months flew by, and weary grew
    To Margaret the sight of happy things;
  Blight fell on all her flowers, instead of dew;
    Shut round her heart were now the joyous wings
  Wherewith it wont to soar; yet not untrue,
    Though tempted much, her woman's nature clings
  To its first pure belief, and with sad eyes
  Looks backward o'er the gate of Paradise
  And so, though altered Mordred came less oft,
    And winter frowned where spring had laughed before,
  In his strange eyes, yet half her sadness doffed,
    And in her silent patience loved him more:
  Sorrow had made her soft heart yet more soft,
    And a new life within her own she bore
  Which made her tenderer, as she felt it move
  Beneath her breast, a refuge for her love
  This babe, she thought, would surely bring him back,
    And be a bond forever them between;
  Before its eyes the sullen tempest-rack
    Would fade, and leave the face of heaven serene;
  And love's return doth more than fill the lack,
    Which in his absence withered the heart's green;
  And yet a dim foreboding still would flit
  Between her and her hope to darken it
  She could not figure forth a happy fate,
    Even for this life from heaven so newly come;
  The earth must needs be doubly desolate
    To him scarce parted from a fairer home:
  Such boding heavier on her bosom sate
    One night, as, standing in the twilight gloam,
  She strained her eyes beyond that dizzy verge
  At whose foot faintly breaks the future's surge
  Poor little spirit! naught but shame and woe
    Nurse the sick heart whose lifeblood nurses thine:
  Yet not those only; love hath triumphed so,
    As for thy sake makes sorrow more divine:
  And yet, though thou be pure, the world is foe
    To purity, if born in such a shrine;
  And, having trampled it for struggling thence,
  Smiles to itself, and calls it Providence
  As thus she mused, a shadow seemed to rise
    From out her thought, and turn to dreariness
  All blissful hopes and sunny memories,
    And the quick blood doth curdle up and press
  About her heart, which seemed to shut its eyes
    And hush itself, as who with shuddering guess
  Harks through the gloom and dreads e'en now to feel
  Through his hot breast the icy slide of steel
  But, at the heart-beat, while in dread she was,
    In the low wind the honeysuckles gleam,
  A dewy thrill flits through the heavy grass,
    And, looking forth, she saw, as in a dream,
  Within the wood the moonlight's shadowy mass:
    Night's starry heart yearning to hers doth seem,
  And the deep sky, full-hearted with the moon,
  Folds round her all the happiness of June
  What fear could face a heaven and earth like this?
    What silveriest cloud could hang 'neath such a sky?
  A tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss
    Rolls back through all her pulses suddenly,
  As if some seraph, who had learned to kiss
    From the fair daughters of the world gone by,
  Had wedded so his fallen light with hers,
  Such sweet, strange joy through soul and body stirs
  Now seek we Mordred: He who did not fear
    The crime, yet fears the latent consequence:
  If it should reach a brother Templar's ear,
    It haply might be made a good pretence
  To cheat him of the hope he held most dear;
    For he had spared no thought's or deed's expense,
  That, by-and-by might help his wish to clip
  Its darling bride,--the high grand mastership
  The apathy, ere a crime resolved is done,
    Is scarce less dreadful than remorse for crime;
  By no allurement can the soul be won
    From brooding o'er the weary creep of time:
  Mordred stole forth into the happy sun,
    Striving to hum a scrap of Breton rhyme,
  But the sky struck him speechless, and he tried
  In vain to summon up his callous pride
  In the court-yard a fountain leaped alway,
    A Triton blowing jewels through his shell
  Into the sunshine; Mordred turned away,
    Weary because the stone face did not tell
  Of weariness, nor could he bear to-day,
    Heartsick, to hear the patient sink and swell
  Of winds among the leaves, or golden bees
  Drowsily humming in the orange-trees
  All happy sights and sounds now came to him
    Like a reproach: he wandered far and wide,
  Following the lead of his unquiet whim,
    But still there went a something at his side
  That made the cool breeze hot, the sunshine dim;
    It would not flee, it could not be defied,
  He could not see it, but he felt it there,
  By the damp chill that crept among his hair
  Day wore at last; the evening star arose,
    And throbbing in the sky grew red and set;
  Then with a guilty, wavering step he goes
    To the hid nook where they so oft had met
  In happier season, for his heart well knows
    That he is sure to find poor Margaret
  Watching and waiting there with lovelorn breast
  Around her young dream's rudely scattered nest
  Why follow here that grim old chronicle
    Which counts the dagger-strokes and drops of blood?
  Enough that Margaret by his mad steel fell,
    Unmoved by murder from her trusting mood,
  Smiling on him as Heaven smiles on Hell,
    With a sad love, remembering when he stood
  Not fallen yet, the unsealer of her heart,
  Of all her holy dreams the holiest part
  His crime complete, scarce knowing what he did,
    (So goes the tale,) beneath the altar there
  In the high church the stiffening corpse he hid,
    And then, to 'scape that suffocating air,
  Like a scared ghoul out of the porch he slid;
    But his strained eyes saw bloodspots everywhere,
  And ghastly faces thrust themselves between
  His soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien
  His heart went out within him, like a spark
    Dropt in the sea; wherever he made bold
  To turn his eyes, he saw, all stiff and stark,
    Pale Margaret lying dead; the lavish gold
  Of her loose hair seemed in the cloudy dark
    To spread a glory, and a thousandfold
  More strangely pale and beautiful she grew:
  Her silence stabbed his conscience through and through
  Or visions of past days,--a mother's eyes
    That smiled down on the fair boy at her knee,
  Whose happy upturned face to hers replies,--
    He saw sometimes: or Margaret mournfully
  Gazed on him full of doubt, as one who tries
    To crush belief that does love injury;
  Then she would wring her hands, but soon again
  Love's patience glimmered out through cloudy pain
  Meanwhile he dared not go and steal away
    The silent, dead-cold witness of his sin;
  He had not feared the life, but that dull clay,
    Those open eyes that showed the death within,
  Would surely stare him mad; yet all the day
    A dreadful impulse, whence his will could win
  No refuge, made him linger in the aisle,
  Freezing with his wan look each greeting smile
  Now, on the second day there was to be
    A festival in church: from far and near
  Came flocking in the sunburnt peasantry,
    And knights and dames with stately antique cheer,
  Blazing with pomp, as if all faÃ«rie
    Had emptied her quaint halls, or, as it were,
  The illuminated marge of some old book,
  While we were gazing, life and motion took
  When all were entered, and the roving eyes
    Of all were staid, some upon faces bright,
  Some on the priests, some on the traceries
    That decked the slumber of a marble knight,
  And all the rustlings over that arise
    From recognizing tokens of delight,
  When friendly glances meet,--then silent ease
  Spread o'er the multitude by slow degrees
  Then swelled the organ: up through choir and nave
    The music trembled with an inward thrill
  Of bliss at its own grandeur: wave on wave
    Its flood of mellow thunder rose, until
  The hushed air shivered with the throb it gave,
    Then, poising for a moment, it stood still,
  And sank and rose again, to burst in spray
  That wandered into silence far away
  Like to a mighty heart the music seemed,
    That yearns with melodies it cannot speak,
  Until, in grand despair of what it dreamed,
    In the agony of effort it doth break,
  Yet triumphs breaking; on it rushed and streamed
    And wantoned in its might, as when a lake,
  Long pent among the mountains, bursts its walls
  And in one crowding gush leaps forth and falls
  Deeper and deeper shudders shook the air,
    As the huge bass kept gathering heavily,
  Like thunder when it rouses in its lair,
    And with its hoarse growl shakes the low-hung sky,
  It grew up like a darkness everywhere,
    Filling the vast cathedral;--suddenly,
  From the dense mass a boy's clear treble broke
  Like lightning, and the full-toned choir awoke
  Through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant,
    Brimming the church with gold and purple mist,
  Meet atmosphere to bosom that rich chant,
    Where fifty voices in one strand did twist
  Their varicolored tones, and left no want
    To the delighted soul, which sank abyssed
  In the warm music cloud, while, far below,
  The organ heaved its surges to and fro
  As if a lark should suddenly drop dead
    While the blue air yet trembled with its song,
  So snapped at once that music's golden thread,
    Struck by a nameless fear that leapt along
  From heart to heart, and like a shadow spread
    With instantaneous shiver through the throng,
  So that some glanced behind, as half aware
  A hideous shape of dread were standing there
  As when a crowd of pale men gather round,
    Watching an eddy in the leaden deep,
  From which they deem the body of one drowned
    Will be cast forth, from face to face doth creep
  An eager dread that holds all tongues fast bound
    Until the horror, with a ghastly leap,
  Starts up, its dead blue arms stretched aimlessly,
  Heaved with the swinging of the careless sea
  So in the faces of all these there grew,
    As by one impulse, a dark, freezing awe,
  Which, with a fearful fascination drew
    All eyes toward the altar; damp and raw
  The air grew suddenly, and no man knew
    Whether perchance his silent neighbor saw
  The dreadful thing which all were sure would rise
  To scare the strained lids wider from their eyes
  The incense trembled as it upward sent
    Its slow, uncertain thread of wandering blue,
  As 't were the only living element
    In all the church, so deep the stillness grew,
  It seemed one might have heard it, as it went,
    Give out an audible rustle, curling through
  The midnight silence of that awe-struck air,
  More hushed than death, though so much life was there
  Nothing they saw, but a low voice was heard
    Threading the ominous silence of that fear,
  Gentle and terrorless as if a bird,
    Wakened by some volcano's glare, should cheer
  The murk air with his song; yet every word
    In the cathedral's farthest arch seemed near
  As if it spoke to every one apart,
  Like the clear voice of conscience in each heart
  "O Rest, to weary hearts thou art most dear!
    O Silence, after life's bewildering din,
  Thou art most welcome, whether in the sear
    Days of our age thou comest, or we win
  Thy poppy-wreath in youth! then wherefore here
    Linger I yet, once free to enter in
  At that wished gate which gentle Death doth ope,
  Into the boundless realm of strength and hope
  "Think not in death my love could ever cease;
    If thou wast false, more need there is for me
  Still to be true; that slumber were not peace,
    If 't were unvisited with dreams of thee:
  And thou hadst never heard such words as these,
    Save that in heaven I must ever be
  Most comfortless and wretched, seeing this
  Our unbaptizÃ¨d babe shut out from bliss
  "This little spirit with imploring eyes
    Wanders alone the dreary wild of space;
  The shadow of his pain forever lies
    Upon my soul in this new dwelling-place;
  His loneliness makes me in Paradise
    More lonely, and, unless I see his face,
  Even here for grief could I lie down and die,
  Save for my curse of immortality
  "World after world he sees around him swim
    Crowded with happy souls, that take no heed
  Of the sad eyes that from the night's faint rim
    Gaze sick with longing on them as they speed
  With golden gates, that only shut out him;
    And shapes sometimes from Hell's abysses freed
  Flap darkly by him, with enormous sweep
  Of wings that roughen wide the pitchy deep
  "I am a mother,--spirits do not shake
    This much of earth from them,--and I must pine
  Till I can feel his little hands, and take
    His weary head upon this heart of mine;
  And, might it be, full gladly for his sake
    Would I this solitude of bliss resign,
  And be shut out of Heaven to dwell with him
  Forever in that silence drear and dim
  "I strove to hush my soul, and would not speak
    At first, for thy dear sake; a woman's love
  Is mighty, but a mother's heart is weak,
    And by its weakness overcomes; I strove
  To smother bitter thoughts with patience meek,
    But still in the abyss my soul would rove,
  Seeking my child, and drove me here to claim
  The rite that gives him peace in Christ's dear name
  "I sit and weep while blessed spirits sing;
    I can but long and pine the while they praise,
  And, leaning o'er the wall of Heaven, I fling
    My voice to where I deem my infant strays,
  Like a robbed bird that cries in vain to bring
    Her nestlings back beneath her wings' embrace;
  But still he answers not, and I but know
  That Heaven and earth are both alike in woe
  Then the pale priests, with ceremony due,
    Baptized the child within its dreadful tomb
  Beneath that mother's heart, whose instinct true
    Star-like had battled down the triple gloom
  Of sorrow, love, and death: young maidens, too,
    Strewed the pale corpse with many a milkwhite bloom,
  And parted the bright hair, and on the breast
  Crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest
  Some said, that, when the priest had sprinkled o'er
    The consecrated drops, they seemed to hear
  A sigh, as of some heart from travail sore
    Released, and then two voices singing clear,
  _Misereatur Deus_, more and more
    Fading far upward, and their ghastly fear
  Fell from them with that sound, as bodies fall
  From souls upspringing to celestial hall
    One after one the stars have risen and set,
  Sparkling upon the hoarfrost on my chain:
  The Bear, that prowled all night about the fold
  Of the North-star, hath shrunk into his den,
  Scared by the blithesome footsteps of the Dawn,
  Whose blushing smile floods all the Orient;
  And now bright Lucifer grows less and less,
  Into the heaven's blue quiet deep-withdrawn.
  Sunless and starless all, the desert sky
  Arches above me, empty as this heart
  For ages hath been empty of all joy,
  Except to brood upon its silent hope,
  As o'er its hope of day the sky doth now.
  All night have I heard voices: deeper yet
  The deep low breathing of the silence grew,
  While all about, muffled in awe, there stood
  Shadows, or forms, or both, clear-felt at heart,
  But, when I turned to front them, far along
  Only a shudder through the midnight ran,
  And the dense stillness walled me closer round.
  But still I heard them wander up and down
  That solitude, and flappings of dusk wings
  Did mingle with them, whether of those hags
  Let slip upon me once from Hades deep,
  Or of yet direr torments, if such be,
  I could but guess; and then toward me came
  A shape as of a woman: very pale
  It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move,
  And mine moved not, but only stared on them.
  Their fixed awe went through my brain like ice,
  A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart,
  And a sharp chill, as if a dank night fog
  Suddenly closed me in, was all I felt:
  And then, methought, I heard a freezing sigh,
  A long, deep, shivering sigh, as from blue lips
  Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought
  Some doom was close upon me, and I looked
  And saw the red moon through the heavy mist,
  Just setting, and it seemed as if it were falling,
  Or reeling to its fall, so dim and dead
  And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged
  Into the rising surges of the pines,
  Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins
  Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength,
  Sent up a murmur in the morning wind,
  Sad as the wail that from the populous earth
  All day and night to high Olympus soars,
  Fit incense to thy wicked throne, O Jove
    Thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn
  From off my lips, for I will tell thy doom.
  And are these tears? Nay, do not triumph, Jove,
  They are wrung from me but by the agonies
  Of prophecy, like those sparse drops which fall
  From clouds in travail of the lightning, when
  The great wave of the storm high-curled and black
  Rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break.
  Why art thou made a god of, thou poor type
  Of anger, and revenge, and cunning force?
  True Power was never born of brutish Strength,
  Nor sweet Truth suckled at the shaggy dugs
  Of that old she-wolf. Are thy thunderbolts,
  That quell the darkness for a space, so strong
  As the prevailing patience of meek Light,
  Who, with the invincible tenderness of peace,
  Wins it to be a portion of herself?
  Why art thou made a god of, thou, who hast
  The never-sleeping terror at thy heart,
  That birthright of all tyrants, worse to bear
  Than this thy ravening bird on which I smile?
  Thou swear'st to free me, if I will unfold
  What kind of doom it is whose omen flits
  Across thy heart, as o'er a troop of doves
  The fearful shadow of the kite. What need
  To know that truth whose knowledge cannot save?
  Evil its errand hath, as well as Good;
  When thine is finished, thou art known no more:
  There is a higher purity than thou,
  And higher purity is greater strength;
  Thy nature is thy doom, at which thy heart
  Trembles behind the thick wall of thy might.
  Let man but hope, and thou art straightway chilled
  With thought of that drear silence and deep night
  Which, like a dream, shall swallow thee and thine:
  Let man but will, and thou art god no more,
  More capable of ruin than the gold
  And ivory that image thee on earth.
  He who hurled down the monstrous Titan-brood
  Blinded with lightnings, with rough thunders stunned,
  Is weaker than a simple human thought.
  My slender voice can shake thee, as the breeze,
  That seems but apt to stir a maiden's hair,
  Sways huge Oceanus from pole to pole:
  For I am still Prometheus, and foreknow
  In my wise heart the end and doom of all
    Yes, I am still Prometheus, wiser grown
  By years of solitude,--that holds apart
  The past and future, giving the soul room
  To search into itself,--and long commune
  With this eternal silence;--more a god,
  In my long-suffering and strength to meet
  With equal front the direst shafts of fate,
  Than thou in thy faint-hearted despotism,
  Girt with thy baby-toys of force and wrath.
  Yes, I am that Prometheus who brought down
  The light to man, which thou, in selfish fear,
  Hadst to thyself usurped,--his by sole right,
  For Man hath right to all save Tyranny,--
  And which shall free him yet from thy frail throne.
  Tyrants are but the spawn of Ignorance,
  Begotten by the slaves they trample on,
  Who, could they win a glimmer of the light,
  And see that Tyranny is always weakness,
  Or Fear with its own bosom ill at ease,
  Would laugh away in scorn the sand-wove chain
  Which their own blindness feigned for adamant.
  Wrong ever builds on quicksands, but the Right
  To the firm centre lays its moveless base.
  The tyrant trembles, if the air but stirs
  The innocent ringlets of a child's free hair,
  And crouches, when the thought of some great spirit,
  With world-wide murmur, like a rising gale,
  Over men's hearts, as over standing corn,
  Rushes, and bends them to its own strong will.
  So shall some thought of mine yet circle earth,
  And puff away thy crumbling altars, Jove
    And, wouldst thou know of my supreme revenge
  Poor tyrant, even now dethroned in heart,
  Realmless in soul, as tyrants ever are,
  Listen! and tell me if this bitter peak,
  This never-glutted vulture, and these chains
  Shrink not before it; for it shall befit
  A sorrow-taught, unconquered Titan-heart.
  Men, when their death is on them, seem to stand
  On a precipitous crag that overhangs
  The abyss of doom, and in that depth to see,
  As in a glass, the features dim and vast
  Of things to come, the shadows, as it seems,
  Of what have been. Death ever fronts the wise;
  Not fearfully, but with clear promises
  Of larger life, on whose broad vans upborne,
  Their out-look widens, and they see beyond
  The horizon of the Present and the Past,
  Even to the very source and end of things.
  Such am I now: immortal woe hath made
  My heart a seer, and my soul a judge
  Between the substance and the shadow of Truth.
  The sure supremeness of the Beautiful,
  By all the martyrdoms made doubly sure
  Of such as I am, this is my revenge,
  Which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch,
  Through which I see a sceptre and a throne.
  The pipings of glad shepherds on the hills,
  Tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee,--
  The songs of maidens pressing with white feet
  The vintage on thine altars poured no more,--
  The murmurous bliss of lovers, underneath
  Dim grape-vine bowers, whose rosy bunches press
  Not half so closely their warm cheeks, unpaled
  By thoughts of thy brute lust,--the hive-like hum
  Of peaceful commonwealths, where sunburnt Toil
  Reaps for itself the rich earth made its own
  By its own labor, lightened with glad hymns
  To an omnipotence which thy mad bolts
  Would cope with as a spark with the vast sea,--
  Even the spirit of free love and peace,
  Duty's sure recompense through life and death,--
  These are such harvests as all master-spirits
  Reap, haply not on earth, but reap no less
  Because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs;
  These are the bloodless daggers wherewithal
  They stab fallen tyrants, this their high revenge:
  For their best part of life on earth is when,
  Long after death, prisoned and pent no more,
  Their thoughts, their wild dreams even, have become
  Part of the necessary air men breathe;
  When, like the moon, herself behind a cloud,
  They shed down light before us on life's sea,
  That cheers us to steer onward still in hope.
  Earth with her twining memories ivies o'er
  Their holy sepulchres; the chainless sea,
  In tempest or wide calm, repeats their thoughts;
  The lightning and the thunder, all free things,
  Have legends of them for the ears of men.
  All other glories are as falling stars,
  But universal Nature watches theirs:
  Such strength is won by love of human kind
    Not that I feel that hunger after fame,
  Which souls of a half-greatness are beset with;
  But that the memory of noble deeds
  Cries, shame upon the idle and the vile,
  And keeps the heart of Man forever up
  To the heroic level of old time.
  To be forgot at first is little pain
  To a heart conscious of such high intent
  As must be deathless on the lips of men;
  But, having been a name, to sink and be
  A something which the world can do without,
  Which, having been or not, would never change
  The lightest pulse of fate,--this is indeed
  A cup of bitterness the worst to taste,
  And this thy heart shall empty to the dregs.
  Endless despair shall be thy Caucasus,
  And memory thy vulture; thou wilt find
  Oblivion far lonelier than this peak,--
  Behold thy destiny! Thou think'st it much
  That I should brave thee, miserable god!
  But I have braved a mightier than thou,
  Even the tempting of this soaring heart,
  Which might have made me, scarcely less than thou,
  A god among my brethren weak and blind,--
  Scarce less than thou, a pitiable thing
  To be down-trodden into darkness soon.
  But now I am above thee, for thou art
  The bungling workmanship of fear, the block
  That awes the swart Barbarian; but I
  Am what myself have made,--a nature wise
  With finding in itself the types of all,--
  With watching from the dim verge of the time
  What things to be are visible in the gleams
  Thrown forward on them from the luminous past,--
  Wise with the history of its own frail heart,
  With reverence and sorrow, and with love,
  Broad as the world, for freedom and for man
    Thou and all strength shall crumble, except Love,
  By whom and for whose glory, ye shall cease:
  And, when thou art but a dim moaning heard
  From out the pitiless glooms of Chaos, I
  Shall be a power and a memory,
  A name to fright all tyrants with, a light
  Unsetting as the pole-star, a great voice
  Heard in the breathless pauses of the fight
  By truth and freedom ever waged with wrong,
  Clear as a silver trumpet, to awake
  Huge echoes that from age to age live on
  In kindred spirits, giving them a sense
  Of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung:
  And many a glazing eye shall smile to see
  The memory of my triumph, (for to meet
  Wrong with endurance, and to overcome
  The present with a heart that looks beyond,
  Are triumph,) like a prophet eagle, perch
  Upon the sacred banner of the Right.
  Evil springs up, and flowers, and bears no seed,
  And feeds the green earth with its swift decay,
  Leaving it richer for the growth of truth;
  But Good, once put in action or in thought,
  Like a strong oak, doth from its boughs shed down
  The ripe germs of a forest. Thou; weak god,
  Shalt fade and be forgotten! but this soul,
  Fresh-living still in the serene abyss,
  In every heaving shall partake, that grows
  From heart to heart among the sons of men,--
  As the ominous hum before the earthquake runs
  Far through the Ãgean from roused isle to isle,--
  Foreboding wreck to palaces and shrines,
  And mighty rents in many a cavernous error
  That darkens the free light to man:--This heart,
  Unscarred by thy grim vulture, as the truth
  Grows but more lovely 'neath the beaks and claws
  Of Harpies blind that fain would soil it, shall
  In all the throbbing exultations share
  That wait on freedom's triumphs, and in all
  The glorious agonies of martyr-spirits,--
  Sharp lightning-throes to split the jagged clouds
  That veil the future, showing them the end,--
  Pain's thorny crown for constancy and truth,
  Girding the temples like a wreath of stars.
  This is a thought, that, like a fabled laurel,
  Makes my faith thunder-proof; and thy dread bolts
  Fall on me like the silent flakes of snow
  On the hoar brows of aged Caucasus:
  But, O thought far more blissful, they can rend
  This cloud of flesh, and make my soul a star
    Unleash thy crouching thunders now, O Jove!
  Free this high heart, which, a poor captive long,
  Doth knock to be let forth, this heart which still,
  In its invincible manhood, overtops
  Thy puny godship, as this mountain doth
  The pines that moss its roots. O, even now,
  While from my peak of suffering I look down,
  Beholding with a far-spread gush of hope
  The sunrise of that Beauty, in whose face,
  Shone all around with love, no man shall look
  But straightway like a god he is uplift
  Unto the throne long empty for his sake,
  And clearly oft foreshadowed in wide dreams
  By his free inward nature, which nor thou,
  Nor any anarch after thee, can bind
  From working its great doom,--now, now set free
  This essence, not to die, but to become
  Part of that awful Presence which doth haunt
  The palaces of tyrants, to hunt off,
  With its grim eyes and fearful whisperings
  And hideous sense of utter loneliness,
  All hope of safety, all desire of peace,
  All but the loathed forefeeling of blank death,--
  Part of that spirit which doth ever brood
  In patient calm on the unpilfered nest
  Of man's deep heart, till mighty thoughts grow fledged
  To sail with darkening shadow o'er the world,
  Filling with dread such souls as dare not trust
  In the unfailing energy of Good,
  Until they swoop, and their pale quarry make
  Of some o'erbloated wrong,--that spirit which
  Scatters great hopes in the seed-field of man,
  Like acorns among grain, to grow and be
  A roof for freedom in all coming time
    But no, this cannot be; for ages yet,
  In solitude unbroken, shall I hear
  The angry Caspian to the Euxine shout,
  And Euxine answer with a muffled roar,
  On either side storming the giant walls
  Of Caucasus with leagues of climbing foam,
  (Less, from my height, than flakes of downy snow,)
  That draw back baffled but to hurl again,
  Snatched up in wrath and horrible turmoil,
  Mountain on mountain, as the Titans erst,
  My brethren, scaling the high seat of Jove,
  Heaved Pelion upon Ossa's shoulders broad
  In vain emprise. The moon will come and go
  With her monotonous vicissitude;
  Once beautiful, when I was free to walk
  Among my fellows, and to interchange
  The influence benign of loving eyes,
  But now by aged use grown wearisome;--
  False thought! most false! for how could I endure
  These crawling centuries of lonely woe
  Unshamed by weak complaining, but for thee,
  Loneliest, save me, of all created things,
  Mild-eyed Astarte, my best comforter,
  With thy pale smile of sad benignity
    Year after year will pass away and seem
  To me, in mine eternal agony,
  But as the shadows of dumb summer clouds,
  Which I have watched so often darkening o'er
  The vast Sarmatian plain, league-wide at first,
  But, with still swiftness lessening on and on
  Till cloud and shadow meet and mingle where
  The gray horizon fades into the sky,
  Far, far to the northward. Yes, for ages yet
  Must I lie here upon my altar huge,
  A sacrifice for man. Sorrow will be,
  As it hath been, his portion; endless doom,
  While the immortal with the mortal linked
  Dreams of its wings and pines for what it dreams,
  With upward yearn unceasing. Better so:
  For wisdom is meek sorrow's patient child,
  And empire over self, and all the deep
  Strong charities that make men seem like gods;
  And love, that makes them be gods, from her breasts
  Sucks in the milk that makes mankind one blood.
  Good never comes unmixed, or so it seems,
  Having two faces, as some images
  Are carved, of foolish gods; one face is ill;
  But one heart lies beneath, and that is good,
  As are all hearts, when we explore their depths.
  Therefore, great heart, bear up! thou art but type
  Of what all lofty spirits endure, that fain
  Would win men back to strength and peace through love:
  Each hath his lonely peak, and on each heart
  Envy, or scorn, or hatred, tears lifelong
  With vulture beak; yet the high soul is left;
  And faith, which is but hope grown wise; and love
  And patience, which at last shall overcome
    Violet! sweet violet!
    Thine eyes are full of tears;
      Are they wet
      Even yet
  With the thought of other years?
  Or with gladness are they full,
  For the night so beautiful,
  And longing for those far-off spheres
    Loved-one of my youth thou wast,
    Of my merry youth,
      And I see,
      Tearfully,
  All the fair and sunny past,
  All its openness and truth,
  Ever fresh and green in thee
  As the moss is in the sea
    Thy little heart, that hath with love
    Grown colored like the sky above,
    On which thou lookest ever,
      Can it know
      All the woe
  Of hope for what returneth never,
  All the sorrow and the longing
  To these hearts of ours belonging
      Out on it! no foolish pining
        For the sky
        Dims thine eye,
      Or for the stars so calmly shining;
      Like thee let this soul of mine
  Take hue from that wherefor I long,
  Self-stayed and high, serene and strong,
  Not satisfied with hoping--but divine.
    Violet! dear violet!
    Thy blue eyes are only wet
  With joy and love of him who sent thee,
  And for the fulfilling sense
  Of that glad obedience
  Which made thee all that Nature meant thee
  Thou look'dst on me all yesternight,
  Thine eyes were blue, thy hair was bright
  As when we murmured our troth-plight
  Beneath the thick stars, Rosaline!
  Thy hair was braided on thy head,
  As on the day we two were wed,
  Mine eyes scarce knew if thou wert dead,
  But my shrunk heart knew, Rosaline
  The death-watch ticked behind the wall,
  The blackness rustled like a pall,
  The moaning wind did rise and fall
  Among the bleak pines, Rosaline!
  My heart beat thickly in mine ears;
  The lids may shut out fleshly fears,
  But still the spirit sees and hears,--
  Its eyes are lidless, Rosaline
  A wildness rushing suddenly,
  A knowing some ill-shape is nigh,
  A wish for death, a fear to die,--
  Is not this vengeance, Rosaline?
  A loneliness that is not lone,
  A love quite withered up and gone,
  A strong soul trampled from its throne,--
  What wouldst thou further, Rosaline
  'Tis drear such moonless nights as these,
  Strange sounds are out upon the breeze,
  And the leaves shiver in the trees,
  And then thou comest, Rosaline!
  I seem to hear the mourners go,
  With long black garments trailing slow,
  And plumes anodding to and fro,
  As once I heard them, Rosaline
  Thy shroud is all of snowy white,
  And, in the middle of the night,
  Thou standest moveless and upright,
  Gazing upon me, Rosaline!
  There is no sorrow in thine eyes,
  But evermore that meek surprise,--
  O, God! thy gentle spirit tries
  To deem me guiltless, Rosaline
  Above thy grave the robin sings,
  And swarms of bright and happy things
  Flit all about with sunlit wings,--
  But I am cheerless, Rosaline!
  The violets on the hillock toss,
  The gravestone is o'ergrown with moss;
  For nature feels not any loss,--
  But I am cheerless, Rosaline
  I did not know when thou wast dead;
  A blackbird whistling overhead
  Thrilled through my brain; I would have fled,
  But dared not leave thee, Rosaline!
  The sun rolled down, and very soon,
  Like a great fire, the awful moon
  Rose, stained with blood, and then a swoon
  Crept chilly o'er me, Rosaline
  The stars came out; and, one by one,
  Each angel from his silver throne
  Looked down and saw what I had done;
  I dared not hide me, Rosaline!
  I crouched; I feared thy corpse would cry
  Against me to God's quiet sky,
  I thought I saw the blue lips try
  To utter something, Rosaline
  I waited with a maddened grin
  To hear that voice all icy thin
  Slide forth and tell my deadly sin
  To hell and heaven, Rosaline!
  But no voice came, and then it seemed
  That, if the very corpse had screamed,
  The sound like sunshine glad had streamed
  Through that dark stillness, Rosaline
  And then, amid the silent night,
  I screamed with horrible delight,
  And in my brain an awful light
  Did seem to crackle, Rosaline!
  It is my curse! sweet memories fall
  From me like snow,--and only all
  Of that one night, like cold worms crawl
  My doomed heart over, Rosaline
  Why wilt thou haunt me with thine eyes,
  Wherein such blessed memories,
  Such pitying forgiveness lies,
  Than hate more bitter, Rosaline?
  Woe's me! I know that love so high
  As thine, true soul, could never die,
  And with mean clay in churchyard lie,--
  Would it might be so, Rosaline
  There came a youth upon the earth,
    Some thousand years ago,
  Whose slender hands were nothing worth,
  Whether to plough, or reap, or sow
  Upon an empty tortoise-shell
    He stretched some chords, and drew
  Music that made men's bosoms swell
  Fearless, or brimmed their eyes with dew
  Then King Admetus, one who had
    Pure taste by right divine,
  Decreed his singing not too bad
  To hear between the cups of wine
  And so, well-pleased with being soothed
    Into a sweet half-sleep,
  Three times his kingly beard he smoothed,
  And made him viceroy o'er his sheep
  His words were simple words enough,
    And yet he used them so,
  That what in other mouths was rough
  In his seemed musical and low
  Men called him but a shiftless youth,
    In whom no good they saw;
  And yet, unwittingly, in truth,
  They made his careless words their law
  They knew not how he learned at all,
    For idly, hour by hour,
  He sat and watched the dead leaves fall,
  Or mused upon a common flower
  It seemed the loveliness of things
    Did teach him all their use,
  For, in mere weeds, and stones, and springs,
  He found a healing power profuse
  Men granted that his speech was wise,
    But, when a glance they caught
  Of his slim grace and woman's eyes,
  They laughed, and called him good-for-naught
  Yet after he was dead and gone,
    And e'en his memory dim,
  Earth seemed more sweet to live upon,
  More full of love, because of him
  And day by day more holy grew
    Each spot where he had trod,
  Till after-poets only knew
  Their first-born brother as a god
  It is a mere wild rosebud,
    Quite sallow now, and dry,
  Yet there 's something wondrous in it,--
    Some gleams of days gone by,--
  Dear sights and sounds that are to me
  The very moons of memory,
  And stir my heart's blood far below
  Its short-lived waves of joy and woe
  Lips must fade and roses wither,
    All sweet times be o'er,--
  They only smile, and, murmuring "Thither!"
    Stay with us no more:
  And yet ofttimes a look or smile,
  Forgotten in a kiss's while,
  Years after from the dark will start,
  And flash across the trembling heart
  Thou hast given me many roses,
    But never one, like this,
  O'erfloods both sense and spirit
    With such a deep, wild bliss;
  We must have instincts that glean up
  Sparse drops of this life in the cup,
  Whose taste shall give us all that we
  Can prove of immortality
  Earth's stablest things are shadows,
    And, in the life to come,
  Haply some chance-saved trifle
  May tell of this old home:
  As now sometimes we seem to find,
  In a dark crevice of the mind,
  Some relic, which, long pondered o'er,
  Hints faintly at a life before
    He spoke of Burns: men rude and rough
    Pressed round to hear the praise of one
  Whose heart was made of manly, simple stuff,
     As homespun as their own
    And, when he read, they forward leaned,
    Drinking, with thirsty hearts and ears,
  His brook-like songs whom glory never weaned
     From humble smiles and tears
    Slowly there grew a tender awe,
    Sun-like, o'er faces brown and hard,
  As if in him who read they felt and saw
     Some presence of the bard
    It was a sight for sin and wrong
    And slavish tyranny to see,
  A sight to make our faith more pure and strong
     In high humanity
    I thought, these men will carry hence
    Promptings their former life above,
  And something of a finer reverence
     For beauty, truth, and love
    God scatters love on every side,
    Freely among his children all,
  And always hearts are lying open wide,
     Wherein some grains may fall
    There is no wind but soweth seeds
    Of a more true and open life,
  Which burst, unlooked-for, into high-souled deeds,
     With wayside beauty rife
    We find within these souls of ours
    Some wild germs of a higher birth,
  Which in the poet's tropic heart bear flowers
     Whose fragrance fills the earth
    Within the hearts of all men lie
    These promises of wider bliss,
  Which blossom into hopes that cannot die,
     In sunny hours like this
    All that hath been majestical
    In life or death, since time began,
  Is native in the simple heart of all,
     The angel heart of man
    And thus, among the untaught poor,
    Great deeds and feelings find a home,
  That cast in shadow all the golden lore
     Of classic Greece and Rome
    O, mighty brother-soul of man,
    Where'er thou art, in low or high,
  Thy skiey arches with exulting span
     O'er-roof infinity
    All thoughts that mould the age begin
    Deep down within the primitive soul,
  And from the many slowly upward win
     To one who grasps the whole
    In his wide brain the feeling deep
    That struggled on the many's tongue
  Swells to a tide of thought, whose surges leap
     O'er the weak thrones of wrong
    All thought begins in feeling,--wide
    In the great mass its base is hid,
  And, narrowing up to thought, stands glorified,
     A moveless pyramid
    Nor is he far astray who deems
    That every hope, which rises and grows broad
  In the world's heart, by ordered impulse streams
     From the great heart of God
    God wills, man hopes: in common souls
    Hope is but vague and undefined,
  Till from the poet's tongue the message rolls
     A blessing to his kind
    Never did Poesy appear
    So full of heaven to me, as when
  I saw how it would pierce through pride and fear
     To the lives of coarsest men
    It may be glorious to write
    Thoughts that shall glad the two or three
  High souls, like those far stars that come in sight
     Once in a century
    But better far it is to speak
    One simple word, which now and then
  Shall waken their free nature in the weak
     And friendless sons of men
    To write some earnest verse or line,
    Which, seeking not the praise of art,
  Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine
     In the untutored heart
    He who doth this, in verse or prose,
    May be forgotten in his day,
  But surely shall be crowned at last with those
     Who live and speak for aye
                  RHÅ
    God sends his teachers unto every age,
  To every clime, and every race of men,
  With revelations fitted to their growth
  And shape of mind, nor gives the realm of Truth
  Into the selfish rule of one sole race:
  Therefore each form of worship that hath swayed
  The life of man, and given it to grasp
  The master-key of knowledge, reverence,
  Enfolds some germs of goodness and of right;
  Else never had the eager soul, which loathes
  The slothful down of pampered ignorance,
  Found in it even a moment's fitful rest
    There is an instinct in the human heart
  Which makes that all the fables it hath coined,
  To justify the reign of its belief
  And strengthen it by beauty's right divine,
  Veil in their inner cells a mystic gift,
  Which, like the hazel twig, in faithful hands,
  Points surely to the hidden springs of truth.
  For, as in nature naught is made in vain,
  But all things have within their hull of use
  A wisdom and a meaning which may speak
  Of spiritual secrets to the ear
  Of spirit; so, in whatsoe'er the heart
  Hath fashioned for a solace to itself,
  To make its inspirations suit its creed,
  And from the niggard hands of falsehood wring
  Its needful food of truth, there ever is
  A sympathy with Nature, which reveals,
  Not less than her own works, pure gleams of light
  And earnest parables of inward lore.
  Hear now this fairy legend of old Greece,
  As full of freedom, youth, and beauty still
  As the immortal freshness of that grace
  Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze
    A youth named RhÅcus, wandering in the wood,
  Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall,
  And, feeling pity of so fair a tree,
  He propped its gray trunk with admiring care,
  And with a thoughtless footstep loitered on.
  But, as he turned, he heard a voice behind
  That murmured "RhÅcus!" 'Twas as if the leaves,
  Stirred by a passing breath, had murmured it,
  And, while he paused bewildered, yet again
  It murmured "RhÅcus!" softer than a breeze.
  He started and beheld with dizzy eyes
  What seemed the substance of a happy dream
  Stand there before him, spreading a warm glow
  Within the green glooms of the shadowy oak.
  It seemed a woman's shape, yet all too fair
  To be a woman, and with eyes too meek
  For any that were wont to mate with gods.
  All naked like a goddess stood she there,
  And like a goddess all too beautiful
  To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame.
  "RhÅcus, I am the Dryad of this tree,"
  Thus she began, dropping her low-toned words
  Serene, and full, and clear, as drops of dew,
  "And with it I am doomed to live and die;
  The rain and sunshine are my caterers,
  Nor have I other bliss than simple life;
  Now ask me what thou wilt, that I can give,
  And with a thankful joy it shall be thine
    Then RhÅcus, with a flutter at the heart,
  Yet, by the prompting of such beauty, bold,
  Answered: "What is there that can satisfy
  The endless craving of the soul but love?
  Give me thy love, or but the hope of that
  Which must be evermore my spirit's goal."
  After a little pause she said again,
  But with a glimpse of sadness in her tone,
  "I give it, RhÅcus, though a perilous gift;
  An hour before the sunset meet me here."
  And straightway there was nothing he could see
  But the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak,
  And not a sound came to his straining ears
  But the low trickling rustle of the leaves,
  And far away upon an emerald slope
  The falter of an idle shepherd's pipe
    Now, in those days of simpleness and faith,
  Men did not think that happy things were dreams
  Because they overstepped the narrow bourne
  Of likelihood, but reverently deemed
  Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful
  To be the guerdon of a daring heart.
  So RhÅcus made no doubt that he was blest,
  And all along unto the city's gate
  Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked,
  The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont,
  And he could scarce believe he had not wings
  Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins
  Instead of blood, so light he felt and strange
    Young RhÅcus had a faithful heart enough,
  But one that in the present dwelt too much,
  And, taking with blithe welcome whatsoe'er
  Chance gave of joy, was wholly bound in that,
  Like the contented peasant of a vale,
  Deemed it the world, and never looked beyond.
  So, haply meeting in the afternoon
  Some comrades who were playing at the dice
  He joined them and forgot all else beside
    The dice were rattling at the merriest,
  And RhÅcus, who had met but sorry luck,
  Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw,
  When through the room there hummed a yellow bee
  That buzzed about his ear with down-dropped legs
  As if to light. And RhÅcus laughed and said,
  Feeling how red and flushed he was with loss,
  "By Venus! does he take me for a rose?"
  And brushed him off with rough, impatient hand.
  But still the bee came back, and thrice again
  RhÅcus did beat him off with growing wrath.
  Then through the window flew the wounded bee,
  And RhÅcus, tracking him with angry eyes,
  Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly
  Against the red disc of the setting sun,--
  And instantly the blood sank from his heart,
  As if its very walls had caved away.
  Without a word he turned, and, rushing forth,
  Ran madly through the city and the gate,
  And o'er the plain, which now the wood's long shade,
  By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim,
  Darkened wellnigh unto the city's wall
    Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree,
  And, listening fearfully, he heard once more
  The low voice murmur "RhÅcus!" close at hand:
  Whereat he looked around him, but could see
  Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.
  Then sighed the voice, "Oh, RhÅcus! nevermore
  Shalt thou behold me or by day or night,
  Me, who would fain have blessed thee with a love
  More ripe and bounteous than ever yet
  Filled up with nectar any mortal heart:
  But thou didst scorn my humble messenger,
  And sent'st him back to me with bruisÃ¨d wings.
  We spirits only show to gentle eyes.
  We ever ask an undivided love,
  And he who scorns the least of Nature's works
  Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all.
  Farewell! for thou canst never see me more
    Then RhÅcus beat his breast, and groaned aloud
  And cried, "Be pitiful! forgive me yet
  This once, and I shall never need it more!"
  "Alas!" the voice returned, "'t is thou art blind,
  Not I unmerciful; I can forgive,
  But have no skill to heal thy spirit's eyes;
  Only the soul hath power o'er itself."
  With that again there murmured "Nevermore!"
  And RhÅcus after heard no other sound,
  Except the rattling of the oak's crisp leaves,
  Like the long surf upon a distant shore,
  Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down.
  The night had gathered round him: o'er the plain
  The city sparkled with its thousand lights,
  And sounds of revel fell upon his ear
  Harshly and like a curse; above, the sky,
  With all its bright sublimity of stars,
  Deepened, and on his forehead smote the breeze;
  Beauty was all around him and delight,
  But from that eve he was alone on earth
  I know a falcon swift and peerless
    As e'er was cradled in the pine;
  No bird had ever eye so fearless,
    Or wings so strong as this of mine
  The winds not better love to pilot
    A cloud with molten gold o'errun,
  Than him, a little burning islet,
    A star above the coming sun
  For with a lark's heart he doth tower,
    By a glorious, upward instinct drawn;
  No bee nestles deeper in the flower
    Than he in the bursting rose of dawn
  No harmless dove, no bird that singeth,
    Shudders to see him overhead;
  The rush of his fierce swooping bringeth
    To innocent hearts no thrill of dread
  Let fraud and wrong and baseness shiver,
    For still between them and the sky
  The falcon Truth hangs poised forever
    And marks them with his vengeful eye
  Whether the idle prisoner through his grate
  Watches the waving of the grass-tuft small,
  Which, having colonized its rift i' the wall,
  Takes its free risk of good or evil fate,
  And, from the sky's just helmet draws its lot
  Daily of shower or sunshine, cold or hot;--
  Whether the closer captive of a creed,
  Cooped up from birth to grind out endless chaff,
  Sees through his treadmill-bars the noonday laugh,
  And feels in vain his crumpled pinions breed;--
  Whether the Georgian slave look up and mark,
  With bellying sails puffed full, the tall cloud-bark
  Sink northward slowly,--thou alone seem'st good,
  Fair only thou, O Freedom, whose desire
  Can light in muddiest souls quick seeds of fire,
  And strain life's chords to the old heroic mood
  Yet are there other gifts more fair than thine,
  Nor can I count him happiest who has never
  Been forced with his own hand his chains to sever,
  And for himself find out the way divine;
  He never knew the aspirer's glorious pains,
  He never earned the struggle's priceless gains.
  O, block by block, with sore and sharp endeavor,
  Lifelong we build these human natures up
  Into a temple fit for freedom's shrine,
  And Trial ever consecrates the cup
  Wherefrom we pour her sacrificial wine
  Ay, pale and silent maiden,
    Cold as thou liest there,
  Thine was the sunniest nature
    That ever drew the air,
  The wildest and most wayward,
    And yet so gently kind,
  Thou seemedst but to body
    A breath of summer wind
  Into the eternal shadow
    That girds our life around,
  Into the infinite silence
    Wherewith Death's shore is bound,
  Thou hast gone forth, belovÃ¨d!
    And I were mean to weep,
  That thou hast left Life's shallows,
    And dost possess the Deep
  Thou liest low and silent,
    Thy heart is cold and still,
  Thine eyes are shut forever,
    And Death hath had his will;
  He loved and would have taken,
    I loved and would have kept,
  We strove,--and he was stronger,
    And I have never wept
  Let him possess thy body,
    Thy soul is still with me,
  More sunny and more gladsome
    Than it was wont to be:
  Thy body was a fetter
    That bound me to the flesh,
  Thank God that it is broken,
    And now I live afresh
  Now I can see thee clearly;
    The dusky cloud of clay,
  That hid thy starry spirit,
    Is rent and blown away:
  To earth I give thy body,
    Thy spirit to the sky,
  I saw its bright wings growing,
    And knew that thou must fly
  Now I can love thee truly,
    For nothing comes between
  The senses and the spirit,
    The seen and the unseen;
  Lifts the eternal shadow,
    The silence bursts apart,
  And the soul's boundless future
    Is present in my heart
  Worn and footsore was the Prophet,
    When he gained the holy hill;
  "God has left the earth," he murmured,
   "Here his presence lingers still
  "God of all the olden prophets,
    Wilt thou speak with men no more?
  Have I not as truly served thee,
    As thy chosen ones of yore
  "Hear me, guider of my fathers,
    Lo! a humble heart is mine;
  By thy mercy I beseech thee,
    Grant thy servant but a sign
  Bowing then his head, he listened
    For an answer to his prayer;
  No loud burst of thunder followed,
    Not a murmur stirred the air
  But the tuft of moss before him
    Opened while he waited yet,
  And, from out the rock's hard bosom,
    Sprang a tender violet
  "God! I thank thee," said the Prophet
   "Hard of heart and blind was I,
  Looking to the holy mountain
    For the gift of prophecy
  "Still thou speakest with thy children
    Freely as in eld sublime;
  Humbleness, and love, and patience,
    Still give empire over time
  "Had I trusted in my nature,
    And had faith in lowly things,
  Thou thyself wouldst then have sought me,
    And set free my spirit's wings
  "But I looked for signs and wonders,
    That o'er men should give me sway,
  Thirsting to be more than mortal,
    I was even less than clay
  "Ere I entered on my journey,
    As I girt my loins to start,
  Ran to me my little daughter,
    The beloved of my heart
  "In her hand she held a flower,
    Like to this as like may be,
  Which, beside my very threshold,
    She had plucked and brought to me
    We see but half the causes of our deeds,
  Seeking them wholly in the outer life,
  And heedless of the encircling spirit-world,
  Which, though unseen, is felt, and sows in us
  All germs of pure and world-wide purposes.
  From one stage of our being to the next
  We pass unconscious o'er a slender bridge,
  The momentary work of unseen hands,
  Which crumbles down behind us; looking back,
  We see the other shore, the gulf between,
  And, marvelling how we won to where we stand,
  Content ourselves to call the builder Chance,
  We trace the wisdom to the apple's fall,
  Not to the birth-throes of a mighty Truth
  Which, for long ages in blank Chaos dumb,
  Yet yearned to be incarnate, and had found
  At last a spirit meet to be the womb
  From which it might be born to bless mankind,--
  Not to the soul of Newton, ripe with all
  The hoarded thoughtfulness of earnest years,
  And waiting but one ray of sunlight more
  To blossom fully
                   But whence came that ray?
  We call our sorrows Destiny, but ought
  Rather to name our high successes so.
  Only the instincts of great souls are Fate,
  And have predestined sway: all other things,
  Except by leave of us, could never be.
  For Destiny is but the breath of God
  Still moving in us, the last fragment left
  Of our unfallen nature, waking oft
  Within our thought, to beckon us beyond
  The narrow circle of the seen and known,
  And always tending to a noble end,
  As all things must that overrule the soul,
  And for a space unseat the helmsman, Will.
  The fate of England and of freedom once
  Seemed wavering in the heart of one plain man,
  One step of his and the great dial-hand,
  That marks the destined progress of the world
  In the eternal round from wisdom on
  To higher wisdom, had been made to pause
  A hundred years. That step he did not take,--
  He knew not why, nor we, but only God,--
  And lived to make his simple oaken chair
  More terrible and grandly beautiful,
  More full of majesty than any throne
  Before or after, of a British king
    Upon the pier stood two stern-visaged men,
  Looking to where a little craft lay moored,
  Swayed by the lazy current of the Thames,
  Which weltered by in muddy listlessness.
  Grave men they were, and battlings of fierce thought
  Had trampled out all softness from their brows,
  And ploughed rough furrows there before their time,
  For another crop than such as homebred Peace
  Sows broadcast in the willing soil of Youth.
  Care, not of self, but of the commonweal,
  Had robbed their eyes of youth, and left instead
  A look of patient power and iron will,
  And something fiercer, too, that gave broad hint
  Of the plain weapons girded at their sides.
  The younger had an aspect of command,--
  Not such as trickles down, a slender stream,
  In the shrunk channel of a great descent,--
  But such as lies entowered in heart and head,
  And an arm prompt to do the 'hests of both.
  His was a brow where gold were out of place,
  And yet it seemed right worthy of a crown,
  (Though he despised such,) were it only made
  Of iron, or some serviceable stuff
  That would have matched his sinewy, brown face.
  The elder, although he hardly seemed,
  (Care makes so little of some five short years,)
  Had a clear, honest face, whose rough-hewn strength
  Was mildened by the scholar's wiser heart
  To sober courage, such as best befits
  The unsullied temper of a well-taught mind,
  Yet so remained that one could plainly guess
  The hushed volcano smouldering underneath.
  He spoke: the other, hearing, kept his gaze
  Still fixed, as on some problem in the sky
    "O, Cromwell, we are fallen on evil times!
  There was a day when England had wide room
  For honest men as well as foolish kings;
  But now the uneasy stomach of the time
  Turns squeamish at them both. Therefore let us
  Seek out that savage clime, where men as yet
  Are free: there sleeps the vessel on the tide,
  Her languid canvas drooping for the wind;
  Give us but that, and what need we to fear
  This Order of the Council? The free waves
  Will not say, No, to please a wayward king,
  Nor will the winds turn traitors at his beck:
  All things are fitly cared for, and the Lord
  Will watch as kindly o'er the exodus
  Of us his servants now, as in old time.
  We have no cloud or fire, and haply we
  May not pass dry-shod through the ocean-stream;
  But, saved or lost, all things are in His hand."
  So spake he, and meantime the other stood
  With wide gray eyes still reading the blank air,
  As if upon the sky's blue wall he saw
  Some mystic sentence, written by a hand
  Such as of old made pale the Assyrian king,
  Girt with his satraps in the blazing feast
    "Hampden! a moment since, my purpose was
  To fly with thee,--for I will call it flight,
  Nor flatter it with any smoother name,--
  But something in me bids me not to go;
  And I am one, thou knowest, who, unmoved
  By what the weak deem omens, yet give heed
  And reverence due to whatsoe'er my soul
  Whispers of warning to the inner ear.
  Moreover, as I know that God brings round
  His purposes in ways undreamed by us,
  And makes the wicked but his instruments
  To hasten on their swift and sudden fall,
  I see the beauty of his providence
  In the King's order: blind, he will not let
  His doom part from him, but must bid it stay
  As 't were a cricket, whose enlivening chirp
  He loved to hear beneath his very hearth.
  Why should we fly? Nay, why not rather stay
  And rear again our Zion's crumbled walls,
  Not, as of old the walls of Thebes were built,
  By minstrel twanging, but, if need should be,
  With the more potent music of our swords?
  Think'st thou that score of men beyond the sea
  Claim more God's care than all of England here?
  No: when he moves His arm, it is to aid
  Whole peoples, heedless if a few be crushed,
  As some are ever, when the destiny
  Of man takes one stride onward nearer home.
  Believe it, 'tis the mass of men He loves;
  And, where there is most sorrow and most want,
  Where the high heart of man is trodden down
  The most, 'tis not because He hides his face
  From them in wrath, as purblind teachers prate.
  Not so: there most is He, for there is He
  Most needed. Men who seek for Fate abroad
  Are not so near his heart as they who dare
  Frankly to face her where she faces them,
  On their own threshold, where their souls are strong
  To grapple with and throw her; as I once,
  Being yet a boy, did cast this puny king,
  Who now has grown so dotard as to deem
  That he can wrestle with an angry realm,
  And throw the brawned AntÃ¦us of men's rights.
  No, Hampden! they have half-way conquered Fate
  Who go half-way to meet her,--as will I.
  Freedom hath yet a work for me to do;
  So speaks that inward voice which never yet
  Spake falsely, when it urged the spirit on
  To noble deeds for country and mankind.
  And, for success, I ask no more than this,--
  To bear unflinching witness to the truth.
  All true, whole men succeed: for what is worth
  Success's name, unless it be the thought,
  The inward surety, to have carried out
  A noble purpose to a noble end,
  Although it be the gallows or the block?
  'Tis only Falsehood that doth ever need
  These outward shows of gain to bolster her.
  Be it we prove the weaker with our swords;
  Truth only needs to be for once spoke out,
  And there's such music in her, such strange rhythm,
  As makes men's memories her joyous slaves,
  And clings around the soul, as the sky clings
  Round the mute earth, forever beautiful,
  And, if o'erclouded, only to burst forth
  More all-embracingly divine and clear:
  Get but the truth once uttered, and 'tis like
  A star new-born, that drops into its place,
  And which, once circling in its placid round,
  Not all the tumult of the earth can shake
    "What should we do in that small colony
  Of pinched fanatics, who would rather choose
  Freedom to clip an inch more from their hair,
  Than the great chance of setting England free?
  Not there, amid the stormy wilderness,
  Should we learn wisdom; or if learned, what room
  To put it into act,--else worse than naught?
  We learn our souls more, tossing for an hour
  Upon this huge and ever-vexÃ¨d sea
  Of human thought, where kingdoms go to wreck
  Like fragile bubbles yonder in the stream,
  Than in a cycle of New England sloth,
  Broke only by some petty Indian war,
  Or quarrel for a letter more or less,
  In some hard word, which, spelt in either way
  Not their most learned clerks can understand.
  New times demand new measures and new men;
  The world advances, and in time outgrows
  The laws that in our fathers' day were best;
  And, doubtless, after us, some purer scheme
  Will be shaped out by wiser men than we,
  Made wiser by the steady growth of truth.
  We cannot bring Utopia by force;
  But better, almost, be at work in sin;
  Than in a brute inaction browse and sleep.
  No man is born into the world, whose work
  Is not born with him; there is always work,
  And tools to work withal, for those who will;
  And blessÃ¨d are the horny hands of toil!
  The busy world shoves angrily aside
  The man who stands with arms akimbo set,
  Until occasion tells him what to do;
  And he who waits to have his task marked out
  Shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled.
  Our time is one that calls for earnest deeds:
  Reason and Government, like two broad seas,
  Yearn for each other with outstretched arms
  Across this narrow isthmus of the throne,
  And roll their white surf higher every day.
  One age moves onward, and the next builds up
  Cities and gorgeous palaces, where stood
  The rude log huts of those who tamed the wild,
  Rearing from out the forests they had felled
  The goodly framework of a fairer state;
  The builder's trowel and the settler's axe
  Are seldom wielded by the selfsame hand;
  Ours is the harder task, yet not the less
  Shall we receive the blessing for our toil
  From the choice spirits of the aftertime.
  My soul is not a palace of the past,
  Where outworn creeds, like Rome's gray senate quake,
  Hearing afar the Vandal's trumpet hoarse,
  That shakes old systems with a thunder-fit.
  The time is ripe, and rotten-ripe, for change;
  Then let it come: I have no dread of what
  Is called for by the instinct of mankind;
  Nor think I that God's world will fall apart,
  Because we tear a parchment more or less.
  Truth is eternal, but her effluence,
  With endless change is fitted to the hour;
  Her mirror is turned forward to reflect
  The promise of the future, not the past.
  He who would win the name of truly great
  Must understand his own age and the next,
  And make the present ready to fulfil
  Its prophecy, and with the future merge
  Gently and peacefully, as wave with wave.
  The future works out great men's destinies;
  The present is enough for common souls,
  Who, never looking forward, are indeed
  Mere clay, wherein the footprints of their age
  Are petrified forever: better those
  Who lead the blind old giant by the hand
  From out the pathless desert where he gropes,
  And set him onward in his darksome way.
  I do not fear to follow out the truth,
  Albeit along the precipice's edge.
  Let us speak plain: there is more force in names
  Than most men dream of; and a lie may keep
  Its throne a whole age longer, if it skulk
  Behind the shield of some fair-seeming name,
  Let us call tyrants, _tyrants_, and maintain,
  That only freedom comes by grace of God,
  And all that comes not by his grace must fall
  For men in earnest have no time to waste
  In patching fig-leaves for the naked truth
    "I will have one more grapple with the man
  Charles Stuart: whom the boy o'ercame,
  The man stands not in awe of. I, perchance,
  Am one raised up by the Almighty arm
  To witness some great truth to all the world.
  Souls destined to o'erleap the vulgar lot,
  And mould the world unto the scheme of God,
  Have a fore-consciousness of their high doom,
  As men are known to shiver at the heart,
  When the cold shadow of some coming ill
  Creeps slowly o'er their spirits unawares.
  Hath Good less power of prophecy than Ill?
  How else could men whom God hath called to sway
  Earth's rudder, and to steer the bark of Truth,
  Beating against the tempest tow'rd her port,
  Bear all the mean and buzzing grievances,
  The petty martyrdoms, wherewith Sin strives
  To weary out the tethered hope of Faith,
  The sneers, the unrecognizing look of friends,
  Who worship the dead corpse of old king Custom,
  Where it doth lie in state within the Church,
  Striving to cover up the mighty ocean
  With a man's palm, and making even the truth
  Lie for them, holding up the glass reversed,
  To make the hope of man seem farther off?
  My God! when I read o'er the bitter lives
  Of men whose eager hearts were quite too great
  To beat beneath the cramped mode of the day,
  And see them mocked at by the world they love,
  Haggling with prejudice for pennyworths
  Of that reform which their hard toil will make
  The common birthright of the age to come,--
  When I see this, spite of my faith in God,
  I marvel how their hearts bear up so long;
  Nor could they, but for this same prophecy,
  This inward feeling of the glorious end
    "Deem me not fond; but in my warmer youth,
  Ere my heart's bloom was soiled and brushed away,
  I had great dreams of mighty things to come;
  Of conquest, whether by the sword or pen
  I knew not; but some conquest I would have,
  Or else swift death: now wiser grown in years,
  I find youth's dreams are but the flutterings
  Of those strong wings whereon the soul shall soar
  In aftertime to win a starry throne;
  And so I cherish them, for they were lots,
  Which I, a boy, cast in the helm of Fate.
  Now will I draw them, since a man's right hand,
  A right hand guided by an earnest soul,
  With a true instinct, takes the golden prize
  From out a thousand blanks. What men call luck
  Is the prerogative of valiant souls,
  The fealty life pays its rightful kings.
  The helm is shaking now, and I will stay
  To pluck my lot forth; it were sin to flee
    So they two turned together; one to die,
  Fighting for freedom on the bloody field;
  The other, far more happy, to become
  A name earth wears forever next her heart;
  One of the few that have a right to rank
  With the true Makers: for his spirit wrought
  Order from Chaos; proved that right divine
  Dwelt only in the excellence of truth;
  And far within old Darkness' hostile lines
  Advanced and pitched the shining tents of Light.
  Nor shall the grateful Muse forget to tell,
  That--not the least among his many claims
  To deathless honor--he was Milton's friend,
  A man not second among those who lived
  To show us that the poet's lyre demands
  An arm of tougher sinew than the sword
  O, moonlight deep and tender,
    A year and more agone,
  Your mist of golden splendor
    Round my betrothal shone
  O, elm-leaves dark and dewy,
    The very same ye seem,
  The low wind trembles through ye,
    Ye murmur in my dream
  O, river, dim with distance,
    Flow thus forever by:
  A part of my existence
    Within your heart doth lie
  O, stars, ye saw our meeting,
    Two beings and one soul,
  Two hearts so madly beating
    To mingle and be whole
  O, happy night, deliver
    Her kisses back to me,
  Or keep them all, and give her
    A blissful dream of me

  [Footnote A: For the leading incidents in this tale, I am
     indebted to the very valuable "Algic Researches" of Henry R.
     Schoolcraft, Esq
    The old Chief, feeling now well-nigh his end,
  Called his two eldest children to his side,
  And gave them, in few words, his parting charge:--
  "My son and daughter, me ye see no more;
  The happy hunting-grounds await me, green
  With change of spring and summer through the year:
  But, for remembrance, after I am gone,
  Be kind to little Sheemah for my sake:
  Weakling he is and young, and knows not yet
  To set the trap, or draw the seasoned bow;
  Therefore of both your loves he hath more need,
  And he, who needeth love, to love hath right;
  It is not like our furs and stores of corn,
  Whereto we claim sole title by our toil,
  But the Great Spirit plants it in our hearts,
  And waters it, and gives it sun, to be
  The common stock and heritage of all:
  Therefore be kind to Sheemah, that yourselves
  May not be left deserted in your need
    Alone, beside a lake, their wigwam stood,
  Far from the other dwellings of their tribe;
  And, after many moons, the loneliness
  Wearied the elder brother, and he said,
  "Why should I dwell here all alone, shut out
  From the free, natural joys that fit my age?
  Lo, I am tall and strong, well skilled to hunt,
  Patient of toil and hunger, and not yet
  Have seen the danger which I dared not look
  Full in the face; what hinders me to be
  A mighty Brave and Chief among my kin?"
  So, taking up his arrows and his bow,
  As if to hunt, he journeyed swiftly on,
  Until he gained the wigwams of his tribe,
  Where, choosing out a bride, he soon forgot,
  In all the fret and bustle of new life,
  The little Sheemah and his father's charge
    Now when the sister found her brother gone,
  And that, for many days, he came not back,
  She wept for Sheemah more than for herself;
  For Love bides longest in a woman's heart,
  And flutters many times before he flies,
  And then doth perch so nearly, that a word
  May lure him back, as swift and glad as light;
  And Duty lingers even when Love is gone
  Oft looking out in hope of his return;
  And, after Duty hath been driven forth,
  Then Selfishness creeps in the last of all,
  Warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth,
  And crouching o'er the embers, to shut out
  Whatever paltry warmth and light are left,
  With avaricious greed, from all beside.
  So, for long months, the sister hunted wide,
  And cared for little Sheemah tenderly;
  But, daily more and more, the loneliness
  Grew wearisome, and to herself she sighed,
  "Am I not fair? at least the glassy pool,
  That hath no cause to flatter, tells me so;
  But, O, how flat and meaningless the tale,
  Unless it tremble on a lover's tongue!
  Beauty hath no true glass, except it be
  In the sweet privacy of loving eyes."
  Thus deemed she idly, and forgot the lore
  Which she had learned of nature and the woods,
  That beauty's chief reward is to itself,
  And that the eyes of Love reflect alone
  The inward fairness, which is blurred and lost
  Unless kept clear and white by Duty's care
  So she went forth and sought the haunts of men,
  And, being wedded, in her household cares,
  Soon, like the elder brother, quite forgot
  The little Sheemah and her father's charge
    But Sheemah, left alone within the lodge,
  Waited and waited, with a shrinking heart,
  Thinking each rustle was his sister's step,
  Till hope grew less and less, and then went out,
  And every sound was changed from hope to fear.
  Few sounds there were:--the dropping of a nut,
  The squirrel's chirrup, and the jay's harsh scream,
  Autumn's sad remnants of blithe Summer's cheer,
  Heard at long intervals, seemed but to make
  The dreadful void of silence silenter.
  Soon what small store his sister left was gone,
  And, through the Autumn, he made shift to live
  On roots and berries, gathered in much fear
  Of wolves, whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes,
  Hollow and hungry, at the dead of night.
  But Winter came at last, and, when the snow,
  Thick-heaped for gleaming leagues o'er hill and plain,
  Spread its unbroken silence over all,
  Made bold by hunger, he was fain to glean,
  (More sick at heart than Ruth, and all alone,)
  After the harvest of the merciless wolf,
  Grim Boaz, who, sharp-ribbed and gaunt, yet feared
  A thing more wild and starving than himself;
  Till, by degrees, the wolf and he grew friends,
  And shared, together all the winter through
    Late in the Spring, when all the ice was gone,
  The elder brother, fishing in the lake,
  Upon whose edge his father's wigwam stood,
  Heard a low moaning noise upon the shore:
  Half like a child it seemed, half like a wolf,
  And straightway there was something in his heart
  That said, "It is thy brother Sheemah's voice."
  So, paddling swiftly to the bank, he saw,
  Within a little thicket close at hand,
  A child that seemed fast changing to a wolf,
  From the neck downward, gray with shaggy hair
  That still crept on and upward as he looked.
  The face was turned away, but well he knew
  That it was Sheemah's, even his brother's face.
  Then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes,
  And bowed his head, so that he might not see
  The first look of his brother's eyes, and cried,
  "O, Sheemah! O, my brother, speak to me!
  Dost thou not know me, that I am thy brother?
  Come to me, little Sheemah, thou shalt dwell
  With me henceforth, and know no care or want!"
  Sheemah was silent for a space, as if
  'T were hard to summon up a human voice,
  And, when he spake, the sound was of a wolf's:
  "I know thee not, nor art thou what thou say'st;
  I have none other brethren than the wolves,
  And, till thy heart be changed from what it is,
  Thou art not worthy to be called their kin."
  Then groaned the other, with a choking tongue,
  "Alas! my heart is changed right bitterly;
  'Tis shrunk and parched within me even now!"
  And, looking upward fearfully, he saw
  Only a wolf that shrank away and ran,
  Ugly and fierce, to hide among the woods
  Men! whose boast it is that ye
  Come of fathers brave and free,
  If there breathe on earth a slave,
  Are ye truly free and brave?
  If ye do not feel the chain,
  When it works a brother's pain,
  Are ye not base slaves indeed,
  Slaves unworthy to be freed
  Women! who shall one day bear
  Sons to breathe New England air,
  If ye hear, without a blush,
  Deeds to make the roused blood rush
  Like red lava through your veins,
  For your sisters now in chains,--
  Answer! are ye fit to be
  Mothers of the brave and free
  Is true Freedom but to break
  Fetters for our own dear sake,
  And, with leathern hearts, forget
  That we owe mankind a debt?
  No! true freedom is to share
  All the chains our brothers wear,
  And, with heart and hand, to be
  Earnest to make others free
  They are slaves who fear to speak
  For the fallen and the weak,
  They are slaves who will not choose
  Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
  Rather than in silence shrink
  From the truth they needs must think;
  They are slaves who dare not be
  In the right with two or three
  The cordage creaks and rattles in the wind,
  With freaks of sudden hush; the reeling sea
  Now thumps like solid rock beneath the stern,
  Now leaps with clumsy wrath, strikes short, and, falling
  Crumbled to whispery foam, slips rustling down
  The broad backs of the waves, which jostle and crowd
  To fling themselves upon that unknown shore,
  Their used familiar since the dawn of time,
  Whither this foredoomed life is guided on
  To sway on triumph's hushed, aspiring poise
  One glittering moment, then to break fulfilled
  How lonely is the sea's perpetual swing,
  The melancholy wash of endless waves,
  The sigh of some grim monster undescried,
  Fear-painted on the canvas of the dark,
  Shifting on his uneasy pillow of brine!
  Yet night brings more companions than the day
  To this drear waste; new constellations burn,
  And fairer stars, with whose calm height my soul
  Finds nearer sympathy than with my herd
  Of earthen souls, whose vision's scanty ring
  Makes me its prisoner to beat my wings
  Against the cold bars of their unbelief,
  Knowing in vain my own free heaven beyond.
  O God! this world, so crammed with eager life,
  That comes and goes and wanders back to silence
  Like the idle wind, which yet man's shaping mind
  Can make his drudge to swell the longing sails
  Of highest endeavor,--this mad, unthrift world,
  Which, every hour, throws life enough away
  To make her deserts kind and hospitable,
  Lets her great destinies be waved aside
  By smooth, lip-reverent, formal infidels,
  Who weigh the God they not believe with gold,
  And find no spot in Judas, save that he,
  Driving a duller bargain than he ought,
  Saddled his guild with too cheap precedent.
  O Faith! if thou art strong, thine opposite
  Is mighty also, and the dull fool's sneer
  Hath ofttimes shot chill palsy through the arm,
  Just lifted to achieve its crowning deed,
  And made the firm-based heart, that would have quailed
  The rack or fagot, shudder like a leaf
  Wrinkled with frost, and loose upon its stem.
  The wicked and the weak, by some dark law,
  Have a strange power to shut and rivet down
  Their own horizon round us, to unwing
  Our heaven-aspiring visions, and to blur
  With surly clouds the Future's gleaming peaks,
  Far seen across the brine of thankless years.
  If the chosen soul could never be alone
  In deep mid-silence, open-doored to God,
  No greatness ever had been dreamed or done;
  Among dull hearts a prophet never grew;
  The nurse of full-grown souls is solitude
  The old world is effete; there man with man
  Jostles, and, in the brawl for means to live,
  Life is trod under-foot,--Life, the one block
  Of marble that's vouchsafed wherefrom to carve
  Our great thoughts, white and god-like, to shine down
  The future, Life, the irredeemable block,
  Which one o'er-hasty chisel-dint oft mars,
  Scanting our room to cut the features out
  Of our full hope, so forcing us to crown
  With a mean head the perfect limbs, or leave
  The god's face glowing o'er a satyr's trunk,
  Failure's brief epitaph.
                           Yes, Europe's world
  Reels on to judgment; there the common need,
  Losing God's sacred use, to be a bond
  'Twixt Me and Thee, sets each one scowlingly
  O'er his own selfish hoard at bay; no state,
  Knit strongly with eternal fibres up
  Of all men's separate and united weals,
  Self-poised and sole as stars, yet one as light.
  Holds up a shape of large Humanity
  To which by natural instinct every man
  Pays loyalty exulting, by which all
  Mould their own lives, and feel their pulses filled
  With the red fiery blood of the general life,
  Making them mighty in peace, as now in war
  They are, even in the flush of victory, weak,
  Conquering that manhood which should them subdue.
  And what gift bring I to this untried world?
  Shall the same tragedy be played anew,
  And the same lurid curtain drop at last
  On one dread desolation, one fierce crash
  Of that recoil which on its makers God
  Lets Ignorance and Sin and Hunger make,
  Early or late? Or shall that commonwealth
  Whose potent unity and concentric force
  Can draw these scattered joints and parts of men
  Into a whole ideal man once more,
  Which sucks not from its limbs the life away,
  But sends it flood-tide and creates itself
  Over again in every citizen,
  Be there built up? For me, I have no choice;
  I might turn back to other destinies,
  For one sincere key opes all Fortune's doors;
  But whoso answers not God's earliest call,
  Forfeits or dulls that faculty supreme
  Of lying open to his genius
  Which makes the wise heart certain of its ends
  Here am I; for what end God knows, not I;
  Westward still points the inexorable soul:
  Here am I, with no friend but the sad sea,
  The beating heart of this great enterprise,
  Which, without me, would stiffen in swift death;
  This have I mused on, since mine eye could first
  Among the stars distinguish and with joy
  Rest on that God-fed Pharos of the north,
  On some blue promontory of heaven lighted
  That juts far out into the upper sea;
  To this one hope my heart hath clung for years,
  As would a foundling to the talisman
  Hung round his neck by hands he knew not whose.
  A poor, vile thing and dross to all beside,
  Yet he therein can feel a virtue left
  By the sad pressure of a mother's hand,
  And unto him it still is tremulous
  With palpitating haste and wet with tears,
  The key to him of hope and humanness,
  The coarse shell of life's pearl, Expectancy.
  This hope hath been to me for love and fame,
  Hath made me wholly lonely on the earth,
  Building me up as in a thick-ribbed tower,
  Wherewith enwalled my watching spirit burned,
  Conquering its little island from the Dark,
  Sole as a scholar's lamp, and heard men's steps,
  In the far hurry of the outward world,
  Pass dimly forth and back, sounds heard in dream
  As Ganymede by the eagle was snatched up
  From the gross sod to be Jove's cupbearer,
  So was I lifted by my great design:
  And who hath trod Olympus, from his eye
  Fades not that broader outlook of the gods;
  His life's low valleys overbrow earth's clouds,
  And that Olympian spectre of the past
  Looms towering up in sovereign memory,
  Beckoning his soul from meaner heights of doom.
  Had but the shadow of the Thunderer's bird,
  Flashing athwart my spirit, made of me
  A swift-betraying vision's Ganymede,
  Yet to have greatly dreamed precludes low ends
  Great days have ever such a morning-red,
  On such a base great futures are built up,
  And aspiration, though not put in act,
  Comes back to ask its plighted troth again,
  Still watches round its grave the unlaid ghost
  Of a dead virtue, and makes other hopes,
  Save that implacable one, seem thin and bleak
  As shadows of bare trees upon the snow,
  Bound freezing there by the unpitying moon
  While other youths perplexed their mandolins,
  Praying that Thetis would her fingers twine
  In the loose glories of her lover's hair,
  And wile another kiss to keep back day,
  I, stretched beneath the many-centuried shade
  Of some writhed oak, the wood's LaocoÃ¶n,
  Did of my hope a dryad mistress make,
  Whom I would woo to meet me privily,
  Or underneath the stars, or when the moon
  Flecked all the forest floor with scattered pearls.
  O days whose memory tames to fawning down
  The surly fell of Ocean's bristled neck
  I know not when this hope enthralled me first,
  But from my boyhood up I loved to hear
  The tall-pine-forests of the Apennine
  Murmur their hoary legends of the sea,
  Which hearing, I in vision clear beheld;
  The sudden dark of tropic night shut down
  O'er the huge whisper of great watery wastes,
  The while a pair of herons trailingly
  Flapped inland, where some league-wide river hurled
  The yellow spoil of unconjectured realms
  Far through a gulf's green silence, never scarred
  By any but the Northwind's hurrying keels.
  And not the pines alone; all sights and sounds
  To my world-seeking heart paid fealty,
  And catered for it as the Cretan bees
  Brought honey to the baby Jupiter,
  Who in his soft hand crushed a violet,
  God-like foremusing the rough thunder's gripe;
  Then did I entertain the poet's song,
  My great Idea's guest, and, passing o'er
  That iron bridge the Tuscan built to hell,
  I heard Ulysses tell of mountain-chains
  Whose adamantine links, his manacles,
  The western main shook growling, and still gnawed.
  I brooded on the wise Athenian's tale
  Of happy Atlantis, and heard BjÃ¶rne's keel
  Crunch the gray pebbles of the Vinland shore:
  For I believed the poets; it is they
  Who utter wisdom from the central deep,
  And, listening to the inner flow of things,
  Speak to the age out of eternity
  Ah me! old hermits sought for solitude
  In caves and desert places of the earth,
  Where their own heart-beat was the only stir
  Of living thing that comforted the year;
  But the bald pillar-top of Simeon,
  In midnight's blankest waste, were populous,
  Matched with the isolation drear and deep
  Of him who pines among the swarm of men,
  At once a new thought's king and prisoner,
  Feeling the truer life within his life,
  The fountain of his spirit's prophecy,
  Sinking away and wasting, drop by drop,
  In the ungrateful sands of sceptic ears.
  He in the palace-aisles of untrod woods
  Doth walk a king; for him the pent-up cell
  Widens beyond the circles of the stars,
  And all the sceptred spirits of the past
  Come thronging in to greet him as their peer;
  But in the market-place's glare and throng
  He sits apart, an exile, and his brow
  Aches with the mocking memory of its crown.
  But to the spirit select there is no choice;
  He cannot say, This will I do, or that,
  For the cheap means putting Heaven's ends in pawn,
  And bartering his bleak rocks, the freehold stern
  Of destiny's first-born, for smoother fields
  That yield no crop of self-denying will;
  A hand is stretched to him from out the dark,
  Which grasping without question, he is led
  Where there is work that he must do for God.
  The trial still is the strength's complement,
  And the uncertain, dizzy path that scales
  The sheer heights of supremest purposes
  Is steeper to the angel than the child.
  Chances have laws as fixed as planets have,
  And disappointment's dry and bitter root,
  Envy's harsh berries, and the choking pool
  Of the world's scorn, are the right mother-milk
  To the tough hearts that pioneer their kind,
  And break a pathway to those unknown realms
  That in the earth's broad shadow lie enthralled;
  Endurance is the crowning quality,
  And patience all the passion of great hearts;
  These are their stay, and when the leaden world
  Sets its hard face against their fateful thought,
  And brute strength, like a scornful conqueror,
  Clangs his huge mace down in the other scale,
  The inspired soul but flings his patience in,
  And slowly that outweighs the ponderous globe,--
  One faith against a whole earth's unbelief,
  One soul against the flesh of all mankind
  Thus ever seems it when my soul can hear
  The voice that errs not; then my triumph gleams,
  O'er the blank ocean beckoning, and all night
  My heart flies on before me as I sail;
  Far on I see my lifelong enterprise,
  Which rose like Ganges mid the freezing snows
  Of a world's sordidness, sweep broadening down,
  And, gathering to itself a thousand streams,
  Grow sacred ere it mingle with the sea;
  I see the ungated wall of chaos old,
  With blocks Cyclopean hewn of solid night,
  Fade like a wreath of unreturning mist
  Before the irreversible feet of light;--
  And lo, with what clear omen in the east
  On day's gray threshold stands the eager dawn,
  Like young Leander rosy from the sea
  Glowing at Hero's lattice
                             One day more
  These muttering shoalbrains leave the helm to me.
  God, let me not in their dull ooze be stranded;
  Let not this one frail bark, to hollow which
  I have dug out the pith and sinewy heart
  Of my aspiring life's fair trunk, be so
  Cast up to warp and blacken in the sun,
  Just as the opposing wind 'gins whistle off
  His cheek-swollen mates, and from the leaning mast
  Fortune's full sail strains forward!
                                     One poor day!--
  Remember whose and not how short it is!
  It is God's day, it is Columbus's.
  A lavish day! One day, with life and heart,
  Is more than time enough to find a world
  The tower of old Saint Nicholas soared upward to the skies,
  Like some huge piece of Nature's make, the growth of centuries;
  You could not deem its crowding spires a work of human art,
  They seemed to struggle lightward from a sturdy living heart
  Not Nature's self more freely speaks in crystal or in oak,
  Than, through the pious builder's hand, in that gray pile she spoke;
  And as from acorn springs the oak, so, freely and alone,
  Sprang from his heart this hymn to God, sung in obedient stone
  It seemed a wondrous freak of chance, so perfect, yet so rough,
  A whim of Nature crystallized slowly in granite tough;
  The thick spires yearned towards the sky in quaint, harmonious lines,
  And in broad sunlight basked and slept, like a grove of blasted pines
  Never did rock or stream or tree lay claim with better right
  To all the adorning sympathies of shadow and of light;
  And, in that forest petrified, as forester there dwells
  Stout Herman, the old sacristan, sole lord of all its bells
  Surge leaping after surge, the fire roared onward red as blood,
  Till half of Hamburg lay engulfed beneath the eddying flood;
  For miles away, the fiery spray poured down its deadly rain,
  And back and forth the billows sucked, and paused, and burst again
  From square to square with tiger leaps panted the lustful fire,
  The air to leeward shuddered with the gasps of its desire;
  And church and palace, which even now stood whelmed but to the knee,
  Lift their black roofs like breakers lone amid the whirling sea
  Up in his tower old Herman sat and watched with quiet look;
  His soul had trusted God too long to be at last forsook;
  He could not fear, for surely God a pathway would unfold
  Through this red sea for faithful hearts, as once he did of old
  But scarcely can he cross himself, or on his good saint call,
  Before the sacrilegious flood o'erleaped the churchyard wall;
  And, ere a _pater_ half was said, mid smoke and crackling glare,
  His island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair
  Upon the peril's desperate peak his heart stood up sublime;
  His first thought was for God above, his next was for his chime;
  "Sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise," cried he,
  "As did the Israelites of old, safe walking through the sea
  "Through this red sea our God hath made the pathway safe to shore;
  Our promised land stands full in sight; shout now as ne'er before!"
  And as the tower came crushing down, the bells, in clear accord,
  Pealed forth the grand old German hymn,--"All good souls, praise the
    Lord
  I saw a Sower walking slow
    Across the earth, from east to west;
  His hair was white as mountain snow,
    His head drooped forward on his breast
  With shrivelled hands he flung his seed,
    Nor ever turned to look behind;
  Of sight or sound he took no heed;
    It seemed he was both deaf and blind
  His dim face showed no soul beneath,
    Yet in my heart I felt a stir,
  As if I looked upon the sheath
    That once had clasped Excalibur
  I heard, as still the seed he cast,
    How, crooning to himself, he sung,--
  "I sow again the holy Past,
    The happy days when I was young
  "Then all was wheat without a tare,
    Then all was righteous, fair, and true;
  And I am he whose thoughtful care
    Shall plant the Old World in the New
  "The fruitful germs I scatter free,
    With busy hand, while all men sleep;
  In Europe now, from sea to sea,
    The nations bless me as they reap
  Then I looked back along his path,
    And heard the clash of steel on steel,
  Where man faced man, in deadly wrath,
    While clanged the tocsin's hurrying peal
  The sky with burning towns flared red,
    Nearer the noise of fighting rolled,
  And brothers' blood, by brothers shed,
    Crept, curdling, over pavements cold
  Then marked I how each germ of truth
    Which through the dotard's fingers ran
  Was mated with a dragon's tooth
    Whence there sprang up an armed man
  I shouted, but he could not hear;
    Made signs, but these he could not see;
  And still, without a doubt or fear,
    Broadcast he scattered anarchy
  Long to my straining ears the blast
    Brought faintly back the words he sung:--
  "I sow again the holy Past,
    The happy days when I was young
  Sisters two, all praise to you,
  With your faces pinched and blue;
  To the poor man you've been true
     From of old:
  You can speak the keenest word,
  You are sure of being heard,
  From the point you're never stirred,
     Hunger and Cold
  Let sleek statesmen temporize;
  Palsied are their shifts and lies
  When they meet your bloodshot eyes,
     Grim and bold;
  Policy you set at naught,
  In their traps you'll not be caught,
  You're too honest to be bought,
     Hunger and Cold
  Bolt and bar the palace-door;
  While the mass of men are poor,
  Naked truth grows more and more
     Uncontrolled;
  You had never yet, I guess,
  Any praise for bashfulness,
  You can visit sans court-dress,
     Hunger and Cold
  While the music fell and rose,
  And the dance reeled to its close,
  Where her round of costly woes
     Fashion strolled,
  I beheld with shuddering fear
  Wolves' eyes through the windows peer;
  Little dream they you are near,
     Hunger and Cold
  When the toiler's heart you clutch,
  Conscience is not valued much,
  He recks not a bloody smutch
     On his gold:
  Everything to you defers,
  You are potent reasoners,
  At your whisper Treason stirs,
     Hunger and Cold
  Rude comparisons you draw,
  Words refuse to sate your maw,
  Your gaunt limbs the cobweb law
     Cannot hold:
  You 're not clogged with foolish pride,
  But can seize a right denied;
  Somehow God is on your side,
     Hunger and Cold
  You respect no hoary wrong
  More for having triumphed long;
  Its past victims, haggard throng,
     From the mould
  You unbury: swords and spears
  Weaker are than poor men's tears,
  Weaker than your silent years,
     Hunger and Cold
  Let them guard both hall and bower;
  Through the window you will glower,
  Patient till your reckoning hour
     Shall be tolled:
  Cheeks are pale, but hands are red,
  Guiltless blood may chance be shed,
  But ye must and will be fed,
     Hunger and Cold
  God has plans man must not spoil,
  Some were made to starve and toil,
  Some to share the wine and oil,
     We are told:
  Devil's theories are these,
  Stifling hope and love and peace,
  Framed your hideous lusts to please,
     Hunger and Cold
  Scatter ashes on thy head,
  Tears of burning sorrow shed,
  Earth! and be by pity led
     To Love's fold;
  Ere they block the very door
  With lean corpses of the poor,
  And will hush for naught but gore,--
     Hunger and Cold
  What boot your houses and your lands?
    In spite of close-drawn deed and fence,
  Like water, 'twixt your cheated hands,
  They slip into the graveyard's sands
    And mock your ownership's pretence
  How shall you speak to urge your right,
    Choked with that soil for which you lust
  The bit of clay, for whose delight
  You grasp, is mortgaged, too; Death might
    Foreclose this very day in dust
  Fence as you please, this plain poor man,
    Whose only fields are in his wit,
  Who shapes the world, as best he can,
  According to God's higher plan,
    Owns you and fences as is fit
  Though yours the rents, his incomes wax
    By right of eminent domain;
  From factory tall to woodman's axe,
  All things on earth must pay their tax,
    To feed his hungry heart and brain
  He takes you from your easy-chair,
    And what he plans, that you must do.
  You sleep in down, eat dainty fare,--
  He mounts his crazy garret-stair
    And starves, the landlord over you
  Feeding the clods your idlesse drains,
    You make more green six feet of soil;
  His fruitful word, like suns and rains,
  Partakes the seasons' bounteous pains,
    And toils to lighten human toil
  Your lands, with force or cunning got,
    Shrink to the measure of the grave;
  But Death himself abridges not
  The tenures of almighty thought,
    The titles of the wise and brave
  Far up on Katahdin thou towerest,
    Purple-blue with the distance and vast;
  Like a cloud o'er the lowlands thou lowerest,
    That hangs poised on a lull in the blast,
      To its fall leaning awful
  In the storm, like a prophet o'ermaddened,
    Thou singest and tossest thy branches;
  Thy heart with the terror is gladdened,
    Thou forebodest the dread avalanches,
      When whole mountains swoop valeward
  In the calm thou o'erstretchest the valleys
    With thine arms, as if blessings imploring,
  Like an old king led forth from his palace,
    When his people to battle are pouring
      From the city beneath him
  To the lumberer asleep 'neath thy glooming
    Thou dost sing of wild billows in motion,
  Till he longs to be swung mid their booming
    In the tents of the Arabs of ocean,
      Whose finned isles are their cattle
  For the gale snatches thee for his lyre,
    With mad hand crashing melody frantic,
  While he pours forth his mighty desire
    To leap down on the eager Atlantic,
      Whose arms stretch to his playmate
  The wild storm makes his lair in thy branches,
    Preying thence on the continent under;
  Like a lion, crouched close on his haunches,
    There awaiteth his leap the fierce thunder,
      Growling low with impatience
  Spite of winter, thou keep'st thy green glory,
    Lusty father of Titans past number!
  The snow-flakes alone make thee hoary,
    Nestling close to thy branches in slumber,
      And thee mantling with silence
  Thou alone know'st the splendor of winter,
    Mid thy snow-silvered, hushed precipices,
  Hearing crags of green ice groan and splinter,
    And then plunge down the muffled abysses
      In the quiet of midnight
  Thou alone know'st the glory of summer,
    Gazing down on thy broad seas of forest,
  On thy subjects that send a proud murmur
    Up to thee, to their sachem, who towerest
      From thy bleak throne to heaven
  O, wandering dim on the extremest edge
    Of God's bright providence, whose spirits sigh
  Drearily in you, like the winter sedge
    That shivers o'er the dead pool stiff and dry,
    A thin, sad voice, when the bold wind roars by
         From the clear North of Duty,--
  Still by cracked arch and broken shaft I trace
  That here was once a shrine and holy place
         Of the supernal Beauty,--
    A child's play-altar reared of stones and moss,
    With wilted flowers for offering laid across,
  Mute recognition of the all-ruling Grace
  How far are ye from the innocent, from those
    Whose hearts are as a little lane serene,
  Smooth-heaped from wall to wall with unbroke snows,
    Or in the summer blithe with lamb-cropped green,
    Save the one track, where naught more rude is seen
         Than the plump wain at even
  Bringing home four months' sunshine bound in sheaves!--
  How far are ye from those! yet who believes
         That ye can shut out heaven?
    Your souls partake its influence, not in vain
    Nor all unconscious, as that silent lane
  Its drift of noiseless apple-blooms receives
  Looking within myself, I note how thin
    A plank of station, chance, or prosperous fate,
  Doth fence me from the clutching waves of sin;--
    In my own heart I find the worst man's mate,
    And see not dimly the smooth-hingÃ¨d gate
         That opes to those abysses
  Where ye grope darkly,--ye who never knew
  On your young hearts love's consecrating dew,
         Or felt a mother's kisses,
    Or home's restraining tendrils round you curled.
    Ah, side by side with heart's-ease in this world
  The fatal night-shade grows and bitter rue
  One band ye cannot break,--the force that clips
    And grasps your circles to the central light;
  Yours is the prodigal comet's long ellipse,
    Self-exiled to the farthest verge of night;
    Yet strives with you no less that inward might
         No sin hath e'er imbruted;
  The god in you the creed-dimmed eye eludes;
  The Law brooks not to have its solitudes
         By bigot feet polluted;--
    Yet they who watch your god-compelled return
    May see your happy perihelion burn
  Where the calm sun his unfledged planets broods
  Wondrous and awful are thy silent halls,
     O kingdom of the past!
  There lie the bygone ages in their palls,
     Guarded by shadows vast,--
    There all is hushed and breathless,
  Save when some image of old error falls
    Earth worshipped once as deathless
  There sits drear Egypt, mid beleaguering sands,
     Half woman and half beast,
  The burnt-out torch within her mouldering hands
     That once lit all the East;
    A dotard bleared and hoary,
  There Asser crouches o'er the blackened brands
    Of Asia's long-quenched glory
  Still as a city buried 'neath the sea,
     Thy courts and temples stand;
  Idle as forms on wind-waved tapestry
     Of saints and heroes grand,
    Thy phantasms grope and shiver,
  Or watch the loose shores crumbling silently
    Into Time's gnawing river
  Titanic shapes with faces blank and dun,
     Of their old godhead lorn,
  Gaze on the embers of the sunken sun,
     Which they misdeem for morn;
    And yet the eternal sorrow
  In their unmonarched eyes says day is done
    Without the hope of morrow
  O realm of silence and of swart eclipse,
     The shapes that haunt thy gloom
  Make signs to us and move their withered lips
     Across the gulf of doom;
    Yet all their sound and motion
  Bring no more freight to us than wraiths of ships
    On the mirage's ocean
  And if sometimes a moaning wandereth
     From out thy desolate halls,
  If some grim shadow of thy living death
     Across our sunshine falls
    And scares the world to error,
  The eternal life sends forth melodious breath
    To chase the misty terror
  Thy mighty clamors, wars, and world-noised deeds
     Are silent now in dust,
  Gone like a tremble of the huddling reeds
     Beneath some sudden gust;
    Thy forms and creeds have vanished,
  Tossed out to wither like unsightly weeds
    From the world's garden banished
  Whatever of true life there was in thee
     Leaps in our age's veins;
  Wield still thy bent and wrinkled empery,
     And shake thine idle chains;--
    To thee thy dross is clinging,
  For us thy martyrs die, thy prophets see,
    Thy poets still are singing
  Here, mid the bleak waves of our strife and care,
     Float the green Fortunate Isles,
  Where all thy hero-spirits dwell, and share
     Our martyrdoms and toils;
    The present moves attended
  With all of brave and excellent and fair
    That made the old time splendid
  O Land of Promise! from what Pisgah's height
    Can I behold thy stretch of peaceful bowers,
  Thy golden harvests flowing out of sight,
    Thy nestled homes and sun-illumined towers?
    Gazing upon the sunset's high-heaped gold,
  Its crags of opal and of chrysolite,
    Its deeps on deeps of glory, that unfold
     Still brightening abysses,
     And blazing precipices,
  Whence but a scanty leap it seems to heaven,
     Sometimes a glimpse is given
  Of thy more gorgeous realm, thy more unstinted blisses
  O Land of Quiet! to thy shore the surf
    Of the perturbÃ¨d Present rolls and sleeps;
  Our storms breathe soft as June upon thy turf
    And lure out blossoms; to thy bosom leaps,
  As to a mother's, the o'erwearied heart,
  Hearing far off and dim the toiling mart,
    The hurrying feet, the curses without number,
     And, circled with the glow Elysian,
     Of thine exulting vision,
  Out of its very cares wooes charms for peace and slumber
  To thee the Earth lifts up her fettered hands
    And cries for vengeance; with a pitying smile
  Thou blessest her, and she forgets her bands,
    And her old woe-worn face a little while
  Grows young and noble; unto thee the Oppressor
     Looks, and is dumb with awe;
     The eternal law,
  Which makes the crime its own blindfold redresser,
  Shadows his heart with perilous foreboding,
     And he can see the grim-eyed Doom
     From out the trembling gloom
  Its silent-footed steeds toward his palace goading
  What promises hast thou for Poets' eyes,
    Aweary of the turmoil and the wrong!
  To all their hopes what overjoyed replies!
    What undreamed ecstasies for blissful song!
  Thy happy plains no war-trump's brawling clangor
    Disturbs, and fools the poor to hate the poor;
  The humble glares not on the high with anger;
    Love leaves no grudge at less, no greed for more;
  In vain strives Self the god-like sense to smother;
     From the soul's deeps
     It throbs and leaps;
  The noble 'neath foul rags beholds his long-lost brother
  To thee the Martyr looketh, and his fires
    Unlock their fangs and leave his spirit free;
  To thee the Poet mid his toil aspires,
    And grief and hunger climb about his knee,
  Welcome as children; thou upholdest
    The lone Inventor by his demon haunted;
  The Prophet cries to thee when hearts are coldest,
     And, gazing o'er the midnight's bleak abyss,
     Sees the drowsed soul awaken at thy kiss,
  And stretch its happy arms and leap up disenchanted
  Thou bringest vengeance, but so loving-kindly
    The guilty thinks it pity; taught by thee,
  Fierce tyrants drop the scourges wherewith blindly
    Their own souls they were scarring; conquerors see
  With horror in their hands the accursed spear
    That tore the meek One's side on Calvary,
  And from their trophies shrink with ghastly fear;
     Thou, too, art the Forgiver,
    The beauty of man's soul to man revealing;
     The arrows from thy quiver
  Pierce Error's guilty heart, but only pierce for healing
  O, whither, whither, glory-wingÃ¨d dreams,
    From out Life's sweat and turmoil would ye bear me?
  Shut, gates of Fancy, on your golden gleams,--
    This agony of hopeless contrast spare me!
  Fade, cheating glow, and leave me to my night!
     He is a coward, who would borrow
     A charm against the present sorrow
  From the vague Future's promise of delight:
    As life's alarums nearer roll,
     The ancestral buckler calls,
     Self-clanging from the walls
    In the high temple of the soul;
  Where are most sorrows, there the poet's sphere is,
     To feed the soul with patience,
     To heal its desolations
  With words of unshorn truth, with love that never wearies
    I saw the twinkle of white feet,
  I saw the flash of robes descending;
    Before her ran an influence fleet,
  That bowed my heart like barley bending
    As, in bare fields, the searching bees
  Pilot to blooms beyond our finding,
    It led me on, by sweet degrees,
  Joy's simple honey-cells unbinding
    Those Graces were that seemed grim Fates;
  With nearer love the sky leaned o'er me;
    The long-sought Secret's golden gates
  On musical hinges swung before me
    I saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp
  Thrilling with godhood; like a lover
    I sprang the proffered life to clasp;--
  The beaker fell; the luck was over
    The Earth has drunk the vintage up;
  What boots it patch the goblet's splinters?
    Can Summer fill the icy cup,
  Whose treacherous crystal is but Winter's
    O spendthrift, haste! await the Gods;
  Their nectar crowns the lips of Patience;
    Haste scatters on unthankful sods
  The immortal gift in vain libations
    Coy Hebe flies from those that woo,
  And shuns the hands would seize upon her,
    Follow thy life, and she will sue
  To pour for thee the cup of honor
        I went to seek for Christ,
        And Nature seemed so fair
  That first the woods and fields my youth enticed,
      And I was sure to find him there:
        The temple I forsook,
        And to the solitude
  Allegiance paid; but winter came and shook
      The crown and purple from my wood;
  His snows, like desert sands, with scornful drift,
    Besieged the columned aisle and palace-gate;
  My Thebes, cut deep with many a solemn rift,
    But epitaphed her own sepulchred state:
  Then I remembered whom I went to seek,
  And blessed blunt Winter for his counsel bleak
        Back to the world I turned,
        For Christ, I said, is king;
  So the cramped alley and the hut I spurned,
      As far beneath his sojourning:
        Mid power and wealth I sought,
        But found no trace of him,
  And all the costly offerings I had brought
      With sudden rust and mould grew dim:
  I found his tomb, indeed, where, by their laws,
    All must on stated days themselves imprison,
  Mocking with bread a dead creed's grinning jaws,
    Witless how long the life had thence arisen;
  Due sacrifice to this they set apart,
  Prizing it more than Christ's own living heart
        So from my feet the dust
        Of the proud World I shook;
  Then came dear Love and shared with me his crust,
     And half my sorrow's burden took.
        After the World's soft bed,
        Its rich and dainty fare,
  Like down seemed Love's coarse pillow to my head,
      His cheap food seemed as manna rare;
  Fresh-trodden prints of bare and bleeding feet,
    Turned to the heedless city whence I came,
  Hard by I saw, and springs of worship sweet
    Gushed from my cleft heart smitten by the same;
  Love looked me in the face and spake no words,
  But straight I knew those foot-prints were the Lord's
        I followed where they led
        And in a hovel rude,
  With naught to fence the weather from his head,
      The King I sought for meekly stood
        A naked, hungry child
        Clung round his gracious knee,
  And a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled
      To bless the smile that set him free;
  New miracles I saw his presence do,--
    No more I knew the hovel bare and poor,
  The gathered chips into a woodpile grew,
    The broken morsel swelled to goodly store;
  I knelt and wept: my Christ no more I seek,
  His throne is with the outcast and the weak
  When a deed is done for Freedom, through the broad earth's aching breast
  Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from east to west,
  And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels the soul within him climb
  To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime
  Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny stem of Time
  Through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe,
  When the travail of the Ages wrings earth's systems to and fro;
  At the birth of each new Era, with a recognizing start,
  Nation wildly looks at nation, standing with mute lips apart,
  And glad Truth's yet mightier man-child leaps beneath the Future's heart
  So the Evil's triumph sendeth, with a terror and a chill,
  Under continent to continent, the sense of coming ill,
  And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels his sympathies with God
  In hot tear-drops ebbing earthward, to be drunk up by the sod,
  Till a corpse crawls round unburied, delving in the nobler clod
  For mankind are one in spirit, and an instinct bears along,
  Round the earth's electric circle, the swift flush of right or wrong;
  Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity's vast frame
  Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame;--
  In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim
  Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
  In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
  Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,
  Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right,
  And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light
  Hast thou chosen, O my people, on whose party thou shalt stand,
  Ere the Doom from its worn sandals shakes the dust against our land?
  Though the cause of Evil prosper, yet 'tis Truth alone is strong,
  And, albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng
  Troops of beautiful, tall angels, to enshield her from all wrong
  Backward look across the ages and the beacon-moments see,
  That, like peaks of some sunk continent, jut through Oblivion's sea;
  Not an ear in court or market for the low foreboding cry
  Of those Crises, God's stern winnowers, from whose feet earth's chaff
    must fly;
  Never shows the choice momentous till the judgment hath passed by
  Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record
  One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;
  Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--
  Yet that scaffold sways the Future, and, behind the dim unknown,
  Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own
  We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great,
  Slow of faith, how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate,
  But the soul is still oracular; amid the market's din,
  List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,--
  "They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin
  Slavery, the earthborn Cyclops, fellest of the giant brood,
  Sons of brutish Force and Darkness, who have drenched the earth with
    blood,
  Famished in his self-made desert, blinded by our purer day,
  Gropes in yet unblasted regions for his miserable prey;--
  Shall we guide his gory fingers where our helpless children play
  Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,
  Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just;
  Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,
  Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified,
  And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied
  Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,--they were souls that stood alone,
  While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,
  Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline
  To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,
  By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design
  By the light of burning heretics Christ's bleeding feet I track,
  Toiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back,
  And these mounts of anguish number how each generation learned
  One new word of that grand _Credo_ which in prophet-hearts hath burned
  Since the first man stood God-conquered with his face to heaven upturned
  For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands,
  On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands;
  Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots burn,
  While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return
  To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn
  'Tis as easy to be heroes as to sit the idle slaves
  Of a legendary virtue carved upon our fathers' graves,
  Worshippers of light ancestral make the present light a crime;--
  Was the Mayflower launched by cowards, steered by men behind their time?
  Turn those tracks toward Past or Future, that make Plymouth rock sublime
  They were men of present valor, stalwart old iconoclasts,
  Unconvinced by axe or gibbet that all virtue was the Past's;
  But we make their truth our falsehood, thinking that hath made us free,
  Hoarding it in mouldy parchments, while our tender spirits flee
  The rude grasp of that great Impulse which drove them across the sea
  They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our sires,
  Smothering in their holy ashes Freedom's new-lit altar-fires;
  Shall we make their creed our jailer? Shall we, in our haste to slay,
  From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away
  To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day
  New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good uncouth;
  They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth;
  Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pilgrims be,
  Launch our Mayflower, and steer boldly through the desperate winter sea,
  Nor attempt the Future's portal with the Past's blood-rusted key
    _December, _
     What visionary tints the year puts on,
    When falling leaves falter through motionless air
     Or numbly cling and shiver to be gone!
    How shimmer the low flats and pastures bare,
     As with her nectar Hebe Autumn fills
     The bowl between me and those distant hills,
  And smiles and shakes abroad her misty, tremulous hair
     No more the landscape holds its wealth apart.
    Making me poorer in my poverty,
     But mingles with my senses and my heart;
    My own projected spirit seems to me
     In her own reverie the world to steep;
     'Tis she that waves to sympathetic sleep,
  Moving, as she is moved, each field and hill, and tree
     How fuse and mix, with what unfelt degrees,
    Clasped by the faint horizon's languid arms,
     Each into each, the hazy distances!
    The softened season all the landscape charms;
     Those hills, my native village that embay,
     In waves of dreamier purple roll away,
  And floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms
     Far distant sounds the hidden chickadee
    Close at my side; far distant sound the leaves;
     The fields seem fields of dream, where Memory
    Wanders like gleaning Ruth; and as the sheaves
     Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
     Of Boaz as the maiden's glow went by,
  So tremble and seem remote all things the sense receives
     The cock's shrill trump that tells of scattered corn,
    Passed breezily on by all his flapping mates,
     Faint and more faint, from barn to barn is borne,
    Southward, perhaps to far Magellan's Straits;
     Dimly I catch the throb of distant flails;
     Silently overhead the henhawk sails,
  With watchful, measuring eye, and for his quarry waits
     The sobered robin, hunger-silent now,
    Seeks cedar-berries blue, his autumn cheer;
     The squirrel on the shingly shagbark's bough,
    Now saws, now lists with downward eye and ear,
     Then drops his nut, and, with a chipping bound,
     Whisks to his winding fastness underground;
  The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere
     O'er yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows
    Drowse on the crisp, gray moss; the ploughman's call
     Creeps faint as smoke from black, fresh-furrowed meadows;
    The single crow a single caw lets fall;
     And all around me every bush and tree
     Says Autumn 's here, and Winter soon will be
  Who snows his soft, white sleep and silence over all
     The birch, most shy and lady-like of trees,
    Her poverty, as best she may, retrieves,
     And hints at her foregone gentilities
    With some saved relics of her wealth of leaves;
     The swamp-oak, with his royal purple on,
     Glares red as blood across the sinking sun,
  As one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves
     He looks a sachem, in red blanket wrapt,
    Who, mid some council of the sad-garbed whites,
     Erect and stern, in his own memories lapt,
    With distant eye broods over other sights,
     Sees the hushed wood the city's flare replace,
     The wounded turf heal o'er the railway's trace,
  And roams the savage Past of his undwindled rights
     The red-oak, softer-grained, yields all for lost,
    And, with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry,
     After the first betrayal of the frost,
    Rebuffs the kiss of the relenting sky;
     The chestnuts, lavish of their long-hid gold,
     To the faint Summer, beggared now and old,
  Pour back the sunshine hoarded 'neath her favoring eye
     The ash her purple drops forgivingly
    And sadly, breaking not the general hush;
     The maple-swamps glow like a sunset sea,
    Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
     All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze
     Of bushes low, as when, on cloudy days,
  Ere the rain falls, the cautious farmer burns his brush
     O'er yon low wall, which guards one unkempt zone,
    Where vines, and weeds, and scrub-oaks intertwine
     Safe from the plough, whose rough, discordant stone
    Is massed to one soft gray by lichens fine,
     The tangled blackberry, crossed and recrossed, weaves
     A prickly network of ensanguined leaves;
  Hard by, with coral beads, the prim black-alders shine
     Pillaring with flame this crumbling boundary,
    Whose loose blocks topple 'neath the ploughboy's foot,
     Who, with each sense shut fast except the eye,
    Creeps close and scares the jay he hoped to shoot,
     The woodbine up the elm's straight stem aspires.
     Coiling it, harmless, with autumnal fires;
  In the ivy's paler blaze the martyr oak stands mute
     Below, the Charles--a stripe of nether sky,
    Now hid by rounded apple-trees between,
     Whose gaps the misplaced sail sweeps bellying by,
    Now flickering golden through a woodland screen,
     Then spreading out at his next turn beyond,
     A silver circle like an inland pond--
  Slips seaward silently through marshes purple and green
     Dear marshes! vain to him the gift of sight
    Who cannot in their various incomes share,
     From every season drawn, of shade and light,
    Who sees in them but levels brown and bare;
     Each change of storm or sunshine scatters free
     On them its largesse of variety,
  For nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare
     In Spring they lie one broad expanse of green,
    O'er which the light winds run with glimmering feet;
     Here, yellower stripes track out the creek unseen,
    There, darker growths o'er hidden ditches meet;
     And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd,
     As if the silent shadow of a cloud
  Hung there becalmed, with the next breath to fleet
     All round, upon the river's slippery edge,
    Witching to deeper calm the drowsy tide,
     Whispers and leans the breeze-entangling sedge;
    Through emerald glooms the lingering waters slide,
     Or, sometimes wavering, throw back the sun,
     And the stiff banks in eddies melt and run
  Of dimpling light, and with the current seem to glide
     In Summer 'tis a blithesome sight to see,
    As, step by step, with measured swing, they pass,
     The wide-ranked mowers wading to the knee,
    Their sharp scythes panting through the thick-set grass;
     Then, stretched beneath a rick's shade in a ring,
     Their nooning take, while one begins to sing
  A stave that droops and dies 'neath the close sky of brass
     Meanwhile the devil-may-care, the bobolink,
    Remembering duty, in mid-quaver stops
     Just ere he sweeps o'er rapture's tremulous brink,
    And 'twixt the winrows most demurely drops,
     A decorous bird of business, who provides
     For his brown mate and fledglings six besides,
  And looks from right to left, a farmer mid his crops
     Another change subdues them in the Fall,
    But saddens not; they still show merrier tints,
     Though sober russet seems to cover all;
    When the first sunshine through their dew-drops glints,
     Look how the yellow clearness, streamed across,
     Redeems with rarer hues the season's loss,
  As Dawn's feet there had touched and left their rosy prints
     Or come when sunset gives its freshened zest,
    Lean o'er the bridge and let the ruddy thrill,
     While the shorn sun swells down the hazy west,
    Glow opposite;--the marshes drink their fill
     And swoon with purple veins, then slowly fade
     Through pink to brown, as eastward moves the shade,
  Lengthening with stealthy creep, of Simond's darkening hill
     Later, and yet ere Winter wholly shuts,
    Ere through the first dry snow the runner grates,
     And the loath cart-wheel screams in slippery ruts,
    While firmer ice the eager boy awaits,
     Trying each buckle and strap beside the fire,
     And until bed-time plays with his desire,
  Twenty times putting on and off his new-bought skates
     Then, every morn, the river's banks shine bright
    With smooth plate-armor, treacherous and frail,
     By the frost's clinking hammers forged at night,
   'Gainst which the lances of the sun prevail,
     Giving a pretty emblem of the day
     When guiltier arms in light shall melt away,
  And states shall move free-limbed, loosed from war's cramping mail
     And now those waterfalls the ebbing river
    Twice every day creates on either side
     Tinkle, as through their fresh-sparred grots they shiver
    In grass-arched channels to the sun denied;
     High flaps in sparkling blue the far-heard crow,
     The silvered flats gleam frostily below,
  Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide
     But, crowned in turn by vying seasons three,
    Their winter halo hath a fuller ring;
     This glory seems to rest immovably,--
    The others were too fleet and vanishing;
     When the hid tide is at its highest flow,
     O'er marsh and stream one breathless trance of snow
  With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything
     The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind,
    As pale as formal candles lit by day;
     Gropes to the sea the river dumb and blind;
    The brown ricks, snow-thatched by the storm in play,
     Show pearly breakers combing o'er their lee,
     White crests as of some just enchanted sea,
  Checked in their maddest leap and hanging poised midway
     But when the eastern blow, with rain aslant,
    From mid-sea's prairies green and rolling plains
     Drives in his wallowing herds of billows gaunt,
    And the roused Charles remembers in his veins
     Old Ocean's blood and snaps his gyves of frost,
     That tyrannous silence on the shores is tost
  In dreary wreck, and crumbling desolation reigns
     Edgewise or flat, in Druid-like device,
    With leaden pools between or gullies bare,
     The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice;
    No life, no sound, to break the grim despair,
     Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff
     Down crackles riverward some thaw-sapped cliff,
  Or when the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there
     But let me turn from fancy-pictured scenes
    To that whose pastoral calm before me lies:
     Here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes;
    The early evening with her misty dyes
     Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh,
     Relieves the distant with her cooler sky,
  And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes
     There gleams my native village, dear to me,
    Though higher change's waves each day are seen,
     Whelming fields famed in boyhood's history,
    Sanding with houses the diminished green;
     There, in red brick, which softening time defies,
     Stand square and stiff the Muses' factories;--
  How with my life knit up is every well-known scene
     Flow on, dear river! not alone you flow
    To outward sight, and through your marshes wind;
     Fed from the mystic springs of long-ago,
    Your twin flows silent through my world of mind:
     Grow dim, dear marshes, in the evening's gray!
     Before my inner sight ye stretch away,
  And will forever, though these fleshly eyes grow blind
     Beyond that hillock's house-bespotted swell,
    Where Gothic chapels house the horse and chaise,
     Where quiet cits in Grecian temples dwell,
    Where Coptic tombs resound with prayer and praise,
     Where dust and mud the equal year divide,
     There gentle Allston lived, and wrought, and died,
  Transfiguring street and shop with his illumined gaze
     _Virgilium vidi tantum_,--I have seen
    But as a boy, who looks alike on all,
     That misty hair, that fine Undine-like mien,
    Tremulous as down to feeling's faintest call;--
     Ah, dear old homestead! count it to thy fame
     That thither many times the Painter came;--
  One elm yet bears his name, a feathery tree and tall
     Swiftly the present fades in memory's glow,--
    Our only sure possession is the past;
     The village blacksmith died a month ago,
    And dim to me the forge's roaring blast;
     Soon fire-new mediÃ¦vals we shall see
     Oust the black smithy from its chestnut tree,
  And that hewn down, perhaps, the beehive green and vast
     How many times, prouder than king on throne,
    Loosed from the village school-dame's A's and B's,
     Panting have I the creaky bellows blown,
    And watched the pent volcano's red increase,
     Then paused to see the ponderous sledge, brought down
     By that hard arm voluminous and brown,
  From the white iron swarm its golden vanishing bees
     Dear native town! whose choking elms each year
    With eddying dust before their time turn gray,
     Pining for rain,--to me thy dust is dear;
    It glorifies the eve of summer day,
     And when the westering sun half-sunken burns,
     The mote-thick air to deepest orange turns,
  The westward horseman rides through clouds of gold away
     So palpable, I've seen those unshorn few,
    The six old willows at the causey's end,
     (Such trees Paul Potter never dreamed nor drew,)
    Through this dry mist their checkering shadows send,
     Striped, here and there, with many a long-drawn thread,
     Where streamed through leafy chinks the trembling red,
  Past which, in one bright trail, the hangbird's flashes blend
     Yes, dearer far thy dust than all that e'er,
    Beneath the awarded crown of victory,
     Gilded the blown Olympic charioteer;
    Though lightly prized the ribboned parchments three,
     Yet _collegisse juvat_, I am glad
     That here what colleging was mine I had,--
  It linked another tie, dear native town, with thee
     Nearer art thou than simply native earth,
    My dust with thine concedes a deeper tie;
     A closer claim thy soil may well put forth,
    Something of kindred more than sympathy;
     For in thy bounds I reverently laid away
     That blinding anguish of forsaken clay,
  That title I seemed to have in earth and sea and sky
     That portion of my life more choice to me
    (Though brief, yet in itself so round and whole)
     Than all the imperfect residue can be;--
    The Artist saw his statue of the soul
     Was perfect; so, with one regretful stroke,
     The earthen model into fragments broke,
  And without her the impoverished seasons roll
  A legend that grew in the forest's hush
  Slowly as tear-drops gather and gush,
  When a word some poet chanced to say
  Ages ago, in his careless way,
  Brings our youth back to us out of its shroud
  Clearly as under yon thunder-cloud
  I see that white sea-gull. It grew and grew,
  From the pine-trees gathering a sombre hue,
  Till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast
  Norwegian forests of the past;
  And it grew itself like a true Northern pine,
  First a little slender line,
  Like a mermaid's green eyelash, and then anon
  A stem that a tower might rest upon,
  Standing spear-straight in the waist-deep moss,
  Its bony roots clutching around and across,
  As if they would tear up earth's heart in their grasp
  Ere the storm should uproot them or make them unclasp;
  Its cloudy boughs singing, as suiteth the pine,
  To shrunk snow-bearded sea-kings old songs of the brine,
  Till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor,
  Hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore
  Of Vinland, perhaps, while their prow groped its way
  'Twixt the frothy gnashed tusks of some ship-crunching bay
  So, pine-like, the legend grew, strong-limbed and tall,
  As the Gipsy child grows that eats crusts in the hall;
  It sucked the whole strength of the earth and the sky,
  Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, all brought it supply;
  'Twas a natural growth, and stood fearlessly there,
  A true part of the landscape as sea, land, and air;
  For it grew in good times, ere the fashion it was
  To force up these wild births of the woods under glass,
  And so, if 'tis told as it should be told,
  Though 't were sung under Venice's moonlight of gold,
  You would hear the old voice of its mother, the pine,
  Murmur sea-like and northern through every line,
  And the verses should hang, self-sustained and free,
  Round the vibrating stem of the melody,
  Like the lithe sun-steeped limbs of the parent tree
  Yes, the pine is the mother of legends; what food
  For their grim roots is left when the thousand-yeared wood--
  The dim-aisled cathedral, whose tall arches spring
  Light, sinewy, graceful, firm-set as the wing
  From Michael's white shoulder--is hewn and defaced
  By iconoclast axes in desperate waste,
  And its wrecks seek the ocean it prophesied long,
  Cassandra-like, crooning its mystical song?
  Then the legends go with them,--even yet on the sea
  A wild virtue is left in the touch of the tree,
  And the sailor's night-watches are thrilled to the core
  With the lineal offspring of Odin and Thor
  Yes, wherever the pine-wood has never let in,
  Since the day of creation, the light and the din
  Of manifold life, but has safely conveyed
  From the midnight primeval its armful of shade,
  And has kept the weird Past with its sagas alive
  Mid the hum and the stir of To-day's busy hive,
  There the legend takes root in the age-gathered gloom,
  And its murmurous boughs for their tossing find room
  Where Aroostook, far-heard, seems to sob as he goes
  Groping down to the sea 'neath his mountainous snows;
  Where the lake's frore Sahara of never-tracked white,
  When the crack shoots across it, complains to the night
  With a long, lonely moan, that leagues northward is lost,
  As the ice shrinks away from the tread of the frost;
  Where the lumberers sit by the log-fires which throw
  Their own threatening shadows far round o'er the snow,
  When the wolf howls aloof, and the wavering glare
  Flashes out from the blackness the eyes of the bear,
  When the wood's huge recesses, half-lighted, supply
  A canvas where Fancy her mad brush may try,
  Blotting in giant Horrors that venture not down
  Through the right-angled streets of the brisk, whitewashed town,
  But skulk in the depths of the measureless wood
  Mid the Dark's creeping whispers that curdle the blood,
  When the eye, glanced in dread o'er the shoulder, may dream,
  Ere it shrinks to the camp-fire's companioning gleam,
  That it saw the fierce ghost of the Red Man crouch back
  To the shroud of the tree-trunk's invincible black;--
  There the old shapes crowd thick round the pine-shadowed camp,
  Which shun the keen gleam of the scholarly lamp,
  And the seed of the legend finds true Norland ground,
  While the border-tale's told and the canteen flits round
  Thy love thou sentest oft to me,
    And still as oft I thrust it back;
  Thy messengers I could not see
    In those who everything did lack,--
    The poor, the outcast, and the black
  Pride held his hand before mine eyes,
    The world with flattery stuffed mine ears;
  I looked to see a monarch's guise,
    Nor dreamed thy love would knock for years,
    Poor, naked, fettered, full of tears
  Yet, when I sent my love to thee,
    Thou with a smile didst take it in,
  And entertain'dst it royally,
    Though grimed with earth, with hunger thin,
    And leprous with the taint of sin
  Now every day thy love I meet,
    As o'er the earth it wanders wide,
  With weary step and bleeding feet,
    Still knocking at the heart of pride
    And offering grace, though still denied
  Go! leave me, Priest; my soul would be
    Alone with the consoler, Death;
  Far sadder eyes than thine will see
    This crumbling clay yield up its breath;
  These shrivelled hands have deeper stains
    Than holy oil can cleanse away,--
  Hands that have plucked the world's coarse gains
    As erst they plucked the flowers of May
  Call, if thou canst, to these gray eyes
    Some faith from youth's traditions wrung;
  This fruitless husk which dustward dries
    Has been a heart once, has been young;
  On this bowed head the awful Past
    Once laid its consecrating hands;
  The Future in its purpose vast
    Paused, waiting my supreme commands
  But look! whose shadows block the door?
    Who are those two that stand aloof?
  See! on my hands this freshening gore
    Writes o'er again its crimson proof!
  My looked-for death-bed guests are met;--
    There my dead Youth doth wring its hands,
  And there, with eyes that goad me yet,
    The ghost of my Ideal stands
  God bends from out the deep and says,--
   "I gave thee the great gift of life;
  Wast thou not called in many ways?
    Are not my earth and heaven at strife?
  I gave thee of my seed to sow,
    Bringest thou me my hundred-fold?"
  Can I look up with face aglow,
    And answer, "Father, here is gold
  I have been innocent; God knows
    When first this wasted life began,
  Not grape with grape more kindly grows,
    Than I with every brother-man:
  Now here I gasp; what lose my kind,
    When this fast-ebbing breath shall part?
  What bands of love and service bind
    This being to the world's sad heart
  Christ still was wandering o'er the earth,
    Without a place to lay his head;
  He found free welcome at my hearth,
    He shared my cup and broke my bread:
  Now, when I hear those steps sublime,
    That bring the other world to this,
  My snake-turned nature, sunk in slime,
    Starts sideway with defiant hiss
  Upon the hour when I was born,
    God said, "Another man shall be,"
  And the great Maker did not scorn
    Out of himself to fashion me;
  He sunned me with his ripening looks,
    And Heaven's rich instincts in me grew,
  As effortless as woodland nooks
    Send violets up and paint them blue
  Yes, I who now, with angry tears,
    Am exiled back to brutish clod,
  Have borne unquenched for fourscore years
    A spark of the eternal God;
  And to what end? How yield I back
    The trust for such high uses given?
  Heaven's light hath but revealed a track
    Whereby to crawl away from heaven
  Men think it is an awful sight
    To see a soul just set adrift
  On that drear voyage from whose night
    The ominous shadows never lift;
  But 'tis more awful to behold
    A helpless infant, newly born,
  Whose little hands unconscious hold
    The keys of darkness and of morn
  Mine held them once; I flung away
    Those keys that might have open set
  The golden sluices of the day,
    But clutch the keys of darkness yet;--
  I hear the reapers singing go
    Into God's harvest; I, that might
  With them have chosen, here below
    Grope shuddering at the gates of night
  O glorious Youth, that once wast mine!
    O high ideal! all in vain
  Ye enter at this ruined shrine
    Whence worship ne'er shall rise again,
  The bat and owl inhabit here,
    The snake nests in the altar-stone,
  The sacred vessels moulder near,
    The image of the God is gone
  What gnarlÃ¨d stretch, what depth of shade, is his!
    There needs no crown to mark the forest's king;
  How in his leaves outshines full summer's bliss!
    Sun, storm, rain, dew, to him their tribute bring,
  Which he with such benignant royalty
    Accepts, as overpayeth what is lent;
  All nature seems his vassal proud to be,
    And cunning only for his ornament
  How towers he, too, amid the billowed snows,
    An unquelled exile from the summer's throne,
  Whose plain, uncinctured front more kingly shows,
    Now that the obscuring courtier leaves are flown.
  His boughs make music of the winter air,
    Jewelled with sleet, like some cathedral front
  Where clinging snow-flakes with quaint art repair
    The dints and furrows of time's envious brunt
  How doth his patient strength the rude March wind
    Persuade to seem glad breaths of summer breeze,
  And win the soil that fain would be unkind,
    To swell his revenues with proud increase!
  He is the gem; and all the landscape wide
    (So doth his grandeur isolate the sense)
  Seems but the setting, worthless all beside,
    An empty socket, were he fallen thence
  So, from off converse with life's wintry gales,
    Should man learn how to clasp with tougher roots
  The inspiring earth;--how otherwise avails
    The leaf-creating sap that sunward shoots?
  So every year that falls with noiseless flake
    Should fill old scars upon the stormward side,
  And make hoar age revered for age's sake,
    Not for traditions of youth's leafy pride
  So from the pinched soil of a churlish fate,
    True hearts compel the sap of sturdier growth,
  So between earth and heaven stand simply great,
    That these shall seem but their attendants both;
  For nature's forces with obedient zeal
    Wait on the rooted faith and oaken will;
  As quickly the pretender's cheat they feel,
    And turn mad Pucks to flout and mock him still
  Lord! all thy works are lessons,--each contains
    Some emblem of man's all-containing soul;
  Shall he make fruitless all thy glorious pains,
    Delving within thy grace an eyeless mole?
  Make me the least of thy Dodona-grove,
    Cause me some message of thy truth to bring,
  Speak but a word through me, nor let thy love
    Among my boughs disdain to perch and sing
  Never, surely, was holier man
  Than Ambrose, since the world began;
  With diet spare and raiment thin,
  He shielded himself from the father of sin;
  With bed of iron and scourgings oft,
  His heart to God's hand as wax made soft
  Through earnest prayer and watchings long
  He sought to know 'twixt right and wrong,
  Much wrestling with the blessed Word
  To make it yield the sense of the Lord,
  That he might build a storm-proof creed
  To fold the flock in at their need
  At last he builded a perfect faith,
  Fenced round about with _The Lord thus saith_;
  To himself he fitted the doorway's size,
  Meted the light to the need of his eyes,
  And knew, by a sure and inward sign,
  That the work of his fingers was divine
  Then Ambrose said, "All those shall die
  The eternal death who believe not as I;"
  And some were boiled, some burned in fire,
  Some sawn in twain, that his heart's desire,
  For the good of men's souls, might be satisfied,
  By the drawing of all to the righteous side
  One day, as Ambrose was seeking the truth
  In his lonely walk, he saw a youth
  Resting himself in the shade of a tree;
  It had never been given him to see
  So shining a face, and the good man thought
  'T were pity he should not believe as he ought
  So he set himself by the young man's side,
  And the state of his soul with questions tried;
  But the heart of the stranger was hardened indeed
  Nor received the stamp of the one true creed,
  And the spirit of Ambrose waxed sore to find
  Such face the porch of so narrow a mind
  "As each beholds in cloud and fire
  The shape that answers his own desire,
  So each," said the youth, "in the Law shall find
  The figure and features of his mind;
  And to each in his mercy hath God allowed
  His several pillar of fire and cloud
  The soul of Ambrose burned with zeal
  And holy wrath for the young man's weal:
  "Believest thou then, most wretched youth,"
  Cried he, "a dividual essence in Truth?
  I fear me thy heart is too cramped with sin
  To take the Lord in his glory in
  Now there bubbled beside them where they stood,
  A fountain of waters sweet and good;
  The youth to the streamlet's brink drew near
  Saying, "Ambrose, thou maker of creeds, look here!"
  Six vases of crystal then he took,
  And set them along the edge of the brook
  "As into these vessels the water I pour,
  There shall one hold less, another more,
  And the water unchanged, in every case,
  Shall put on the figure of the vase;
  O thou, who wouldst unity make through strife,
  Canst thou fit this sign to the Water of Life
  When Ambrose looked up, he stood alone,
  The youth and the stream and the vases were gone;
  But he knew, by a sense of humbled grace,
  He had talked with an angel face to face,
  And felt his heart change inwardly,
  As he fell on his knees beneath the tree
  O dwellers in the valley-land,
    Who in deep twilight grope and cower,
  Till the slow mountain's dial-hand
    Shortens to noon's triumphal hour,--
  While ye sit idle, do ye think
    The Lord's great work sits idle too?
  That light dare not o'erleap the brink
    Of morn, because 'tis dark with you
  Though yet your valleys skulk in night,
    In God's ripe fields the day is cried,
  And reapers with their sickles bright,
    Troop, singing, down the mountain side.
  Come up, and feel what health there is
    In the frank Dawn's delighted eyes,
  As, bending with a pitying kiss,
    The night-shed tears of Earth she dries
  The Lord wants reapers: O, mount up,
    Before night comes, and says,--"Too late!"
  Stay not for taking scrip or cup,
    The Master hungers while ye wait;
  'Tis from these heights alone your eyes
    The advancing spears of day can see,
  Which o'er the eastern hill-tops rise,
    To break your long captivity
  Lone watcher on the mountain-height!
    It is right precious to behold
  The first long surf of climbing light
    Flood all the thirsty east with gold;
  But we, who in the shadow sit,
    Know also when the day is nigh,
  Seeing thy shining forehead lit
    With his inspiring prophecy
  Thou hast thine office; we have ours;
    God lacks not early service here,
  But what are thine eleventh hours
    He counts with us for morning cheer
  Our day, for Him, is long enough,
    And when he giveth work to do,
  The bruisÃ¨d reed is amply tough
    To pierce the shield of error through
  But not the less do thou aspire
    Light's earlier messages to preach;
  Keep back no syllable of fire,--
    Plunge deep the rowels of thy speech.
  Yet God deems not thine aÃ«ried sight
    More worthy than our twilight dim,--
  For meek Obedience, too, is Light,
    And following that is finding Him
  It was past the hour of trysting,
    But she lingered for him still;
  Like a child, the eager streamlet
    Leaped and laughed adown the hill,
  Happy to be free at twilight
    From its toiling at the mill
  Then the great moon on a sudden
    Ominous, and red as blood,
  Startling as a new creation,
    O'er the eastern hill-top stood,
  Casting deep and deeper shadows
    Through the mystery of the wood
  Dread closed huge and vague about her,
    And her thoughts turned fearfully
  To her heart, if there some shelter
    From the silence there might be,
  Like bare cedars leaning inland
    From the blighting of the sea
  Yet he came not, and the stillness
    Dampened round her like a tomb;
  She could feel cold eyes of spirits
    Looking on her through the gloom,
  She could hear the groping footsteps
    Of some blind, gigantic doom
  Suddenly the silence wavered
    Like a light mist in the wind,
  For a voice broke gently through it,
    Felt like sunshine by the blind,
  And the dread, like mist in sunshine,
    Furled serenely from her mind
  "Once my love, my love forever,--
    Flesh or spirit still the same;
  If I missed the hour of trysting,
    Do not think my faith to blame.
  I, alas, was made a captive,
    As from Holy Land I came
  "On a green spot in the desert,
    Gleaming like an emerald star,
  Where a palm-tree, in lone silence,
    Yearning for its mate afar,
  Droops above a silver runnel,
    Slender as a scimitar
  "There thou'lt find the humble postern
    To the castle of my foe;
  If thy love burn clear and faithful,
    Strike the gateway, green and low,
  Ask to enter, and the warder
    Surely will not say thee no
  Slept again the aspen silence,
    But her loneliness was o'er;
  Round her heart a motherly patience
    Wrapt its arms for evermore;
  From her soul ebbed back the sorrow,
    Leaving smooth the golden shore
  Donned she now the pilgrim scallop,
    Took the pilgrim staff in hand;
  Like a cloud-shade, flitting eastward,
    Wandered she o'er sea and land;
  And her footsteps in the desert
    Fell like cool rain on the sand
  Soon, beneath the palm-tree's shadow,
    Knelt she at the postern low;
  And thereat she knocketh gently,
    Fearing much the warder's no;
  All her heart stood still and listened,
    As the door swung backward slow
  There she saw no surly warder
    With an eye like bolt and bar;
  Through her soul a sense of music
    Throbbed,--and, like a guardian Lar,
  On the threshold stood an angel,
    Bright and silent as a star
  Fairest seemed he of God's seraphs,
    And her spirit, lily-wise,
  Blossomed when he turned upon her
    The deep welcome of his eyes,
  Sending upward to that sunlight
    All its dew for sacrifice
  Then she heard a voice come onward
    Singing with a rapture new,
  As Eve heard the songs in Eden,
    Dropping earthward with the dew;
  Well she knew the happy singer,
    Well the happy song she knew
  Forward leaped she o'er the threshold,
    Eager as a glancing surf;
  Fell from her the spirit's languor,
    Fell from her the body's scurf;--
  'Neath the palm next day some Arabs
    Found a corpse upon the turf
  Rippling through thy branches goes the sunshine,
  Among thy leaves that palpitate forever;
  Ovid in thee a pining Nymph had prisoned,
  The soul once of some tremulous inland river,
  Quivering to tell her woe, but, ah! dumb, dumb forever
  While all the forest, witched with slumberous moonshine,
  Holds up its leaves in happy, happy silence,
  Waiting the dew, with breath and pulse suspended,--
  I hear afar thy whispering, gleamy islands,
  And track thee wakeful still amid the wide-hung silence
  Upon the brink of some wood-nestled lakelet,
  Thy foliage, like the tresses of a Dryad,
  Dripping about thy slim white stem, whose shadow
  Slopes quivering down the water's dusky quiet,
  Thou shrink'st as on her bath's edge would some startled Dryad
  Thou art the go-between of rustic lovers;
  Thy white bark has their secrets in its keeping;
  Reuben writes here the happy name of Patience,
  And thy lithe boughs hang murmuring and weeping
  Above her, as she steals the mystery from thy keeping
  Thou art to me like my beloved maiden,
  So frankly coy, so full of trembly confidences;
  Thy shadow scarce seems shade, thy pattering leaflets
  Sprinkle their gathered sunshine o'er my senses,
  And Nature gives me all her summer confidences
  Whether my heart with hope or sorrow tremble,
  Thou sympathizest still; wild and unquiet,
  I fling me down; thy ripple, like a river,
  Flows valleyward, where calmness is, and by it
  My heart is floated down into the land of quiet
  I sat one evening in my room,
    In that sweet hour of twilight
  When blended thoughts, half light, half gloom,
    Throng through the spirit's skylight;
  The flames by fits curled round the bars,
    Or up the chimney crinkled,
  While embers dropped like falling stars,
    And in the ashes tinkled
  I sat and mused; the fire burned low,
    And, o'er my senses stealing,
  Crept something of the ruddy glow
    That bloomed on wall and ceiling;
  My pictures (they are very few,--
    The heads of ancient wise men)
  Smoothed down their knotted fronts, and grew
    As rosy as excisemen
  My antique high-backed Spanish chair
    Felt thrills through wood and leather,
  That had been strangers since whilere,
    Mid Andalusian heather,
  The oak that made its sturdy frame
    His happy arms stretched over
  The ox whose fortunate hide became
    The bottom's polished cover
  It came out in that famous bark
    That brought our sires intrepid,
  Capacious as another ark
    For furniture decrepit;--
  For, as that saved of bird and beast
    A pair for propagation,
  So has the seed of these increased
    And furnished half the nation
  Kings sit, they say, in slippery seats;
    But those slant precipices
  Of ice the northern voyager meets
    Less slippery are than this is;
  To cling therein would pass the wit
    Of royal man or woman,
  And whatsoe'er can stay in it
    Is more or less than human
  I offer to all bores this perch,
    Dear well-intentioned people
  With heads as void as week-day church,
    Tongues longer than the steeple;
  To folks with missions, whose gaunt eyes
    See golden ages rising,--
  Salt of the earth! in what queer Guys
    Thou'rt fond of crystallizing
  My wonder, then, was not unmixed
    With merciful suggestion,
  When, as my roving eyes grew fixed
    Upon the chair in question,
  I saw its trembling arms enclose
    A figure grim and rusty,
  Whose doublet plain and plainer hose
    Were something worn and dusty
  Now even such men as Nature forms
    Merely to fill the street with,
  Once turned to ghosts by hungry worms,
    Are serious things to meet with;
  Your penitent spirits are no jokes,
    And, though I'm not averse to
  A quiet shade, even they are folks
    One cares not to speak first to
  Who knows, thought I, but he has come,
    By Charon kindly ferried,
  To tell me of a mighty sum
    Behind my wainscot buried?
  There is a buccaneerish air
    About that garb outlandish----
  Just then the ghost drew up his chair
    And said "My name is Standish
  "I come from Plymouth, deadly bored
    With toasts, and songs, and speeches,
  As long and flat as my old sword,
    As threadbare as my breeches:
  _They_ understand us Pilgrims! they,
    Smooth men with rosy faces,
  Strength's knots and gnarls all pared away,
    And varnish in their places
  "We had some toughness in our grain,
    The eye to rightly see us is
  Not just the one that lights the brain
    Of drawing-room TyrtÃ¦uses:
  _They_ talk about their Pilgrim blood,
    Their birthright high and holy!--
  A mountain-stream that ends in mud
    Methinks is melancholy
  "He had stiff knees, the Puritan,
    That were not good at bending;
  The homespun dignity of man
    He thought was worth defending;
  He did not, with his pinchbeck ore,
    His country's shame forgotten,
  Gild Freedom's coffin o'er and o'er,
    When all within was rotten
  "These loud ancestral boasts of yours,
    How can they else than vex us?
  Where were your dinner orators
    When slavery grasped at Texas?
  Dumb on his knees was every one
    That now is bold as CÃ¦sar,--
  Mere pegs to hang an office on
    Such stalwart men as these are
  "Good Sir," I said, "you seem much stirred
    The sacred compromises----"
  "Now God confound the dastard word!
    My gall thereat arises:
  Northward it hath this sense alone,
    That you, your conscience blinding,
  Shall bow your fool's nose to the stone,
    When slavery feels like grinding
  "'Tis shame to see such painted sticks
    In Vane's and Winthrop's places,
  To see your spirit of Seventy-six
    Drag humbly in the traces,
  With slavery's lash upon her back,
    And herds of office-holders
  To shout applause, as, with a crack,
    It peels her patient shoulders
  "_We_ forefathers to such a rout!--
    No, by my faith in God's word!"
  Half rose the ghost, and half drew out
    The ghost of his old broadsword,
  Then thrust it slowly back again,
    And said, with reverent gesture,
  "No, Freedom, no! blood should not stain
    The hem of thy white vesture
  "I feel the soul in me draw near
    The mount of prophesying;
  In this bleak wilderness I hear
    A John the Baptist crying;
  Far in the east I see upleap
    The streaks of first forewarning,
  And they who sowed the light shall reap
    The golden sheaves of morning
  "Child of our travail and our woe,
    Light in our day of sorrow,
  Through my rapt spirit I foreknow
    The glory of thy morrow;
  I hear great steps, that through the shade
    Draw nigher still and nigher,
  And voices call like that which bade
    The prophet come up higher
  I looked, no form mine eyes could find,
    I heard the red cock crowing,
  And through my window-chinks the wind
    A dismal tune was blowing;
  Thought I, My neighbor Buckingham
  Hath somewhat in him gritty,
  Some Pilgrim-stuff that hates all sham,
  And he will print my ditty
  Look on who will in apathy, and stifle they who can,
  The sympathies, the hopes, the words, that make man truly man;
  Let those whose hearts are dungeoned up with interest or with ease
  Consent to hear with quiet pulse of loathsome deeds like these
  I first drew in New England's air, and from her hardy breast
  Sucked in the tyrant-hating milk that will not let me rest;
  And if my words seem treason to the dullard and the tame,
  'Tis but my Bay-State dialect,--our fathers spake the same
  Shame on the costly mockery of piling stone on stone
  To those who won our liberty, the heroes dead and gone,
  While we look coldly on, and see law-shielded ruffians slay
  The men who fain would win their own, the heroes of to-day
  Are we pledged to craven silence? O fling it to the wind,
  The parchment wall that bars us from the least of human kind,--
  That makes us cringe and temporize, and dumbly stand at rest,
  While Pity's burning flood of words is red-hot in the breast
  Though we break our fathers' promise, we have nobler duties first;
  The traitor to Humanity is the traitor most accursed;
  Man is more than Constitutions; better rot beneath the sod,
  Than be true to Church and State while we are doubly false to God
  We owe allegiance to the State; but deeper, truer, more,
  To the sympathies that God hath set within our spirit's core;--
  Our country claims our fealty; we grant it so, but then
  Before Man made us citizens, great Nature made us men
  He's true to God who's true to man; wherever wrong is done,
  To the humblest and the weakest, neath the all-beholding sun,
  That wrong is also done to us; and they are slaves most base,
  Whose love of right is for themselves, and not for all their race
  God works for all. Ye cannot hem the hope of being free
  With parallels of latitude, with mountain-range or sea.
  Put golden padlocks on Truth's lips, be callous as ye will,
  From soul to soul o'er all the world, leaps one electric thrill
  Chain down your slaves with ignorance, ye cannot keep apart,
  With all your craft of tyranny, the human heart from heart:
  When first the Pilgrims landed on the Bay-State's iron shore,
  The word went forth that slavery should one day be no more
  Out from the land of bondage 'tis decreed our slaves shall go,
  And signs to us are offered, as erst to Pharaoh;
  If we are blind, their exodus, like Israel's of yore,
  Through a Red Sea is doomed to be, whose surges are of gore.
  'Tis ours to save our brethren, with peace and love to win
  Their darkened hearts from error, ere they harden it to sin;
  But if before his duty man with listless spirit stands,
  Ere long the Great Avenger takes the work from out his hands
    Dear common flower, that grow'st beside the way,
  Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold,
        First pledge of blithesome May,
  Which children pluck, and, full of pride, uphold,
    High-hearted buccaneers, o'erjoyed that they
  An Eldorado in the grass have found,
      Which not the rich earth's ample round
    May match in wealth,--thou art more dear to me
    Than all the prouder summer-blooms may be
    Gold such as thine ne'er drew the Spanish prow
  Through the primeval hush of Indian seas,
        Nor wrinkled the lean brow
  Of age, to rob the lover's heart of ease;
    'Tis the spring's largess, which she scatters now
  To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand,
      Though most hearts never understand
    To take it at God's value, but pass by
    The offered wealth with unrewarded eye
    Thou art my tropics and mine Italy;
  To look at thee unlocks a warmer clime;
        The eyes thou givest me
  Are in the heart, and heed not space or time:
    Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee
  Feels a more summer-like warm ravishment
      In the white lily's breezy tent,
    His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first
    From the dark green thy yellow circles burst
    Then think I of deep shadows on the grass,--
  Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze,
        Where, as the breezes pass,
  The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways,--
    Of leaves that slumber in a cloudy mass,
  Or whiten in the wind,--of waters blue
      That from the distance sparkle through
    Some woodland gap,--and of a sky above,
    Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move
    My childhood's earliest thoughts are linked with thee;
  The sight of thee calls back the robin's song,
        Who, from the dark old tree
  Beside the door, sang clearly all day long,
    And I, secure in childish piety,
  Listened as if I heard an angel sing
      With news from heaven, which he could bring
    Fresh every day to my untainted ears,
    When birds and flowers and I were happy peers
    How like a prodigal doth nature seem,
  When thou, for all thy gold, so common art!
        Thou teachest me to deem
  More sacredly of every human heart,
    Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam
  Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show
      Did we but pay the love we owe,
    And with a child's undoubting wisdom look
    On all these living pages of God's book
  Ye who, passing graves by night,
  Glance not to the left or right,
  Lest a spirit should arise,
  Cold and white, to freeze your eyes,
  Some weak phantom, which your doubt
  Shapes upon the dark without
  From the dark within, a guess
  At the spirit's deathlessness,
  Which ye entertain with fear
  In your self-built dungeon here,
  Where ye sell your God-given lives
  Just for gold to buy you gyves,--
  Ye without a shudder meet
  In the city's noonday street,
  Spirits sadder and more dread
  Than from out the clay have fled,
  Buried, beyond hope of light,
  In the body's haunted night
  See ye not that woman pale?
  There are bloodhounds on her trail!
  Bloodhounds two, all gaunt and lean,--
  For the soul their scent is keen,--
  Want and Sin, and Sin is last,--
  They have followed far and fast,
  Want gave tongue, and, at her howl,
  Sin awakened with a growl.
  Ah, poor girl! she had a right
  To a blessing from the light,
  Title-deeds to sky and earth
  God gave to her at her birth,
  But, before they were enjoyed,
  Poverty had made them void,
  And had drunk the sunshine up
  From all nature's ample cup,
  Leaving her a first-born's share
  In the dregs of darkness there.
  Often, on the sidewalk bleak,
  Hungry, all alone, and weak,
  She has seen, in night and storm,
  Rooms o'erflow with firelight warm,
  Which, outside the window-glass,
  Doubled all the cold, alas!
  Till each ray that on her fell
  Stabbed her like an icicle,
  And she almost loved the wail
  Of the bloodhounds on her trail.
  Till the floor becomes her bier,
  She shall feel their pantings near,
  Close upon her very heels,
  Spite of all the din of wheels;
  Shivering on her pallet poor,
  She shall hear them at the door
  Whine and scratch to be let in,
  Sister bloodhounds, Want and Sin
  Hark! that rustle of a dress,
  Stiff with lavish costliness!
  Here comes one whose cheek would flush
  But to have her garment brush
  'Gainst the girl whose fingers thin
  Wove the weary broidery in,
  Bending backward from her toil,
  Lest her tears the silk might soil,
  And, in midnight's chill and murk,
  Stitched her life into the work,
  Shaping from her bitter thought
  Heart's-ease and forget-me-not,
  Satirizing her despair
  With the emblems woven there.
  Little doth the wearer heed
  Of the heart-break in the brede;
  A hyena by her side
  Skulks, down-looking,--it is Pride.
  He digs for her in the earth,
  Where lie all her claims of birth,
  With his foul paws rooting o'er
  Some long-buried ancestor,
  Who, perhaps, a statue won
  By the ill deeds he had done,
  By the innocent blood he shed,
  By the desolation spread
  Over happy villages,
  Blotting out the smile of peace
  There walks Judas, he who sold
  Yesterday his Lord for gold,
  Sold God's presence in his heart
  For a proud step in the mart;
  He hath dealt in flesh and blood,--
  At the bank his name is good,
  At the bank, and only there,
  'Tis a marketable ware.
  In his eyes that stealthy gleam
  Was not learned of sky or stream,
  But it has the cold, hard glint
  Of new dollars from the mint.
  Open now your spirit's eyes,
  Look through that poor clay disguise
  Which has thickened, day by day,
  Till it keeps all light at bay,
  And his soul in pitchy gloom
  Gropes about its narrow tomb,
  From whose dank and slimy walls
  Drop by drop the horror falls.
  Look! a serpent lank and cold
  Hugs his spirit fold on fold;
  From his heart, all day and night,
  It doth suck God's blessed light.
  Drink it will, and drink it must,
  Till the cup holds naught but dust;
  All day long he hears it hiss,
  Writhing in its fiendish bliss;
  All night long he sees its eyes
  Flicker with foul ecstasies,
  As the spirit ebbs away
  Into the absorbing clay
  Who is he that skulks, afraid
  Of the trust he has betrayed,
  Shuddering if perchance a gleam
  Of old nobleness should stream
  Through the pent, unwholesome room,
  Where his shrunk soul cowers in gloom,--
  Spirit sad beyond the rest
  By more instinct for the best?
  'Tis a poet who was sent
  For a bad world's punishment,
  By compelling it to see
  Golden glimpses of To Be,
  By compelling it to hear
  Songs that prove the angels near;
  Who was sent to be the tongue
  Of the weak and spirit-wrung,
  Whence the fiery-winged Despair
  In men's shrinking eyes might flare.
  'Tis our hope doth fashion us
  To base use or glorious:
  He who might have been a lark
  Of Truth's morning, from the dark
  Raining down melodious hope
  Of a freer, broader scope,
  Aspirations, prophecies,
  Of the spirit's full sunrise,
  Chose to be a bird of night,
  Which with eyes refusing light,
  Hooted from some hollow tree
  Of the world's idolatry.
  'Tis his punishment to hear
  Flutterings of pinions near,
  And his own vain wings to feel
  Drooping downward to his heel,
  All their grace and import lost,
  Burdening his weary ghost:
  Ever walking by his side
  He must see his angel guide,
  Who at intervals doth turn
  Looks on him so sadly stern,
  With such ever-new surprise
  Of hushed anguish in her eyes,
  That it seems the light of day
  From around him shrinks away,
  Or drops blunted from the wall
  Built around him by his fall.
  Then the mountains, whose white peaks
  Catch the morning's earliest streaks,
  He must see, where prophets sit,
  Turning east their faces lit,
  Whence, with footsteps beautiful,
  To the earth, yet dim and dull,
  They the gladsome tidings bring,
  Of the sunlight's hastening:
  Never can those hills of bliss
  Be o'erclimbed by feet like his
  But enough! O, do not dare
  From the next the veil to tear,
  Woven of station, trade, or dress,
  More obscene than nakedness,
  Wherewith plausible culture drapes
  Fallen Nature's myriad shapes!
  Let us rather love to mark
  How the unextinguished spark
  Will shine through the thin disguise
  Of our customs, pomps, and lies,
  And, not seldom blown to flame,
  Vindicate its ancient claim
  Some sort of heart I know is hers,--
    I chanced to feel her pulse one night;
  A brain she has that never errs,
    And yet is never nobly right;
  It does not leap to great results,
    But in some corner out of sight,
    Suspects a spot of latent blight,
    And, o'er the impatient infinite,
  She bargains, haggles, and consults
  Her eye,--it seems a chemic test
    And drops upon you like an acid;
  It bites you with unconscious zest,
    So clear and bright, so coldly placid;
  It holds you quietly aloof,
    It holds,--and yet it does not win you;
  It merely puts you to the proof
    And sorts what qualities are in you;
  It smiles, but never brings you nearer,
    It lights,--her nature draws not nigh;
  'Tis but that yours is growing clearer
    To her assays;--yes, try and try,
    You'll get no deeper than her eye
  There, you are classified: she's gone
    Far, far away into herself;
  Each with its Latin label on,
  Your poor components, one by one,
    Are laid upon their proper shelf
  In her compact and ordered mind,
  And what of you is left behind
  Is no more to her than the wind;
  In that clear brain, which, day and night,
    No movement of the heart e'er jostles,
  Her friends are ranged on left and right,--
  Here, silex, hornblende, sienite;
    There, animal remains and fossils
  And yet, O subtile analyst,
    That canst each property detect
  Of mood or grain, that canst untwist
    Each tangled skein of intellect,
  And with thy scalpel eyes lay bare
  Each mental nerve more fine than air,--
    O brain exact, that in thy scales
  Canst weigh the sun and never err,
    For once thy patient science fails,
    One problem still defies thy art;--
  Thou never canst compute for her
  The distance and diameter
    Of any simple human heart
  Hear him but speak, and you will feel
    The shadows of the Portico
  Over your tranquil spirit steal,
    To modulate all joy and woe
    To one subdued, subduing glow;
  Above our squabbling business-hours,
  Like Phidian Jove's, his beauty lowers,
  His nature satirizes ours;
    A form and front of Attic grace,
    He shames the higgling market-place,
  And dwarfs our more mechanic powers
  What throbbing verse can fitly render
  That face,--so pure, so trembling-tender?
    Sensation glimmers through its rest,
  It speaks unmanacled by words,
    As full of motion as a nest
  That palpitates with unfledged birds;
   'Tis likest to Bethesda's stream,
  Forewarned through all its thrilling springs,
    White with the angel's coming gleam,
  And rippled with his fanning wings
  Hear him unfold his plots and plans,
  And larger destinies seem man's;
  You conjure from his glowing face
  The omen of a fairer race;
  With one grand trope he boldly spans
    The gulf wherein so many fall,
   'Twixt possible and actual;
  His first swift word, talaria-shod,
  Exuberant with conscious God,
  Out of the choir of planets blots
  The present earth with all its spots
  Himself unshaken as the sky,
  His words, like whirlwinds, spin on high
    Systems and creeds pellmell together;
  'Tis strange as to a deaf man's eye,
  While trees uprooted splinter by,
    The dumb turmoil of stormy weather;
    Less of iconoclast than shaper,
  His spirit, safe behind the reach
  Of the tornado of his speech,
    Burns calmly as a glowworm's taper
  So great in speech, but, ah! in act
    So overrun with vermin troubles,
  The coarse, sharp-cornered, ugly fact
    Of life collapses all his bubbles:
  Had he but lived in Plato's day,
    He might, unless my fancy errs,
  Have shared that golden voice's sway
    O'er barefooted philosophers.
  Our nipping climate hardly suits
  The ripening of ideal fruits:
  His theories vanquish us all summer,
  But winter makes him dumb and dumber
  To see him mid life's needful things
    Is something painfully bewildering;
  He seems an angel with clipt wings
    Tied to a mortal wife and children,
  And by a brother seraph taken
  In the act of eating eggs and bacon.
  Like a clear fountain, his desire
    Exults and leaps toward the light,
  In every drop it says "Aspire!"
    Striving for more ideal height;
  And as the fountain, falling thence,
    Crawls baffled through the common gutter
  So, from his speech's eminence,
  He shrinks into the present tense,
    Unkinged by foolish bread and butter
  Yet smile not, worldling, for in deeds
    Not all of life that's brave and wise is;
  He strews an ampler future's seeds,
   'Tis your fault if no harvest rises;
  Smooth back the sneer; for is it naught
    That all he is and has is Beauty's?
  By soul the soul's gains must be wrought,
  The Actual claims our coarser thought,
    The Ideal hath its higher duties
  Can this be thou who, lean and pale,
    With such immitigable eye
  Didst look upon those writhing souls in bale,
    And note each vengeance, and pass by
  Unmoved, save when thy heart by chance
  Cast backward one forbidden glance,
    And saw Francesca, with child's glee,
    Subdue and mount thy wild-horse knee
  And with proud hands control its fiery prance
  With half-drooped lids, and smooth, round brow,
    And eye remote, that inly sees
  Fair Beatrice's spirit wandering now
    In some sea-lulled Hesperides,
  Thou movest through the jarring street,
  Secluded from the noise of feet
    By her gift-blossom in thy hand,
    Thy branch of palm from Holy Land;--
  No trace is here of ruin's fiery sleet
  Yet there is something round thy lips
    That prophesies the coming doom,
  The soft, gray herald-shadow ere the eclipse
    Notches the perfect disk with gloom;
  A something that would banish thee,
  And thine untamed pursuer be,
    From men and their unworthy fates,
    Though Florence had not shut her gates,
  And grief had loosed her clutch and let thee free
  Ah! he who follows fearlessly
    The beckonings of a poet-heart
  Shall wander, and without the world's decree,
    A banished man in field and mart;
  Harder than Florence' walls the bar
  Which with deaf sternness holds him far
    From home and friends, till death's release,
    And makes his only prayer for peace,
  Like thine, scarred veteran of a lifelong war
  Death never came so nigh to me before,
  Nor showed me his mild face: oft had I mused
  Of calm and peace and deep forgetfulness,
  Of folded hands, closed eye, and heart at rest,
  And slumber sound beneath a flowery turf,
  Of faults forgotten, and an inner place
  Kept sacred for us in the heart of friends;
  But these were idle fancies, satisfied
  With the mere husk of this great mystery,
  And dwelling in the outward shows of things.
  Heaven is not mounted to on wings of dreams,
  Nor doth the unthankful happiness of youth
  Aim thitherward, but floats from bloom to bloom,
  With earth's warm patch of sunshine well content
  'Tis sorrow builds the shining ladder up,
  Whose golden rounds are our calamities,
  Whereon our firm feet planting, nearer God
  The spirit climbs, and hath its eyes unsealed
  True is it that Death's face seems stern and cold,
  When he is sent to summon those we love,
  But all God's angels come to us disguised;
  Sorrow and sickness, poverty and death,
  One after other lift their frowning masks,
  And we behold the seraph's face beneath,
  All radiant with the glory and the calm
  Of having looked upon the front of God.
  With every anguish of our earthly part
  The spirit's sight grows clearer; this was meant
  When Jesus touched the blind man's lids with clay.
  Life is the jailer, Death the angel sent
  To draw the unwilling bolts and set us free.
  He flings not ope the ivory gate of Rest,--
  Only the fallen spirit knocks at that,--
  But to benigner regions beckons us,
  To destinies of more rewarded toil.
  In the hushed chamber, sitting by the dead,
  It grates on us to hear the flood of life
  Whirl rustling onward, senseless of our loss.
  The bee hums on; around the blossomed vine
  Whirs the light humming-bird; the cricket chirps;
  The locust's shrill alarum stings the ear;
  Hard by, the cock shouts lustily; from farm to farm,
  His cheery brothers, telling of the sun,
  Answer, till far away the joyance dies:
  We never knew before how God had filled
  The summer air with happy living sounds;
  All round us seems an overplus of life,
  And yet the one dear heart lies cold and still.
  It is most strange, when the great miracle
  Hath for our sakes been done, when we have had
  Our inwardest experience of God,
  When with his presence still the room expands,
  And is awed after him, that naught is changed,
  That Nature's face looks unacknowledging,
  And the mad world still dances heedless on
  After its butterflies, and gives no sign.
  'Tis hard at first to see it all aright;
  In vain Faith blows her trump to summon back
  Her scattered troop; yet, through the clouded glass
  Of our own bitter tears, we learn to look
  Undazzled on the kindness of God's face;
  Earth is too dark, and Heaven alone shines through.
  It is no little thing, when a fresh soul
  And a fresh heart, with their unmeasured scope
  For good, not gravitating earthward yet,
  But circling in diviner periods,
  Are sent into the world,--no little thing,
  When this unbounded possibility
  Into the outer silence is withdrawn.
  Ah, in this world, where every guiding thread
  Ends suddenly in the one sure centre, death,
  The visionary hand of Might-have-been
  Alone can fill Desire's cup to the brim
  How changed, dear friend, are thy part and thy child's!
  He bends above _thy_ cradle now, or holds
  His warning finger out to be thy guide;
  Thou art the nurseling now; he watches thee
  Slow learning, one by one, the secret things
  Which are to him used sights of every day;
  He smiles to see thy wondering glances con
  The grass and pebbles of the spirit world,
  To thee miraculous; and he will teach
  Thy knees their due observances of prayer.
  Children are God's apostles, day by day
  Sent forth to preach of love, and hope, and peace,
  Nor hath thy babe his mission left undone.
  To me, at least, his going hence hath given
  Serener thoughts and nearer to the skies,
  And opened a new fountain in my heart
  For thee, my friend, and all: and, O, if Death
  More near approaches meditates, and clasps
  Even now some dearer, more reluctant hand,
  God, strengthen thou my faith, that I may see
  That 'tis thine angel, who, with loving haste,
  Unto the service of the inner shrine
  Doth waken thy belovÃ¨d with a kiss
  Heaven's cup held down to me I drain,
  The sunshine mounts and spurs my brain;
  Bathing in grass, with thirsty eye
  I suck the last drop of the sky;
  With each hot sense I draw to the lees
  The quickening out-door influences,
  And empty to each radiant comer
  A supernaculum of summer:
  Not, Bacchus, all thy grosser juice
  Could bring enchantment so profuse,
  Though for its press each grape-bunch had
  The white feet of an Oread
  Through our coarse art gleam, now and then,
  The features of angelic men;
  'Neath the lewd Satyr's veiling paint
  Glows forth the Sibyl, Muse, or Saint;
  The dauber's botch no more obscures
  The mighty Master's portraitures.
  And who can say what luckier beam
  The hidden glory shall redeem,
  For what chance clod the soul may wait
  To stumble on its nobler fate,
  Or why, to his unwarned abode,
  Still by surprises comes the God?
  Some moment, nailed on sorrow's cross,
  May mediate a whole youth's loss,
  Some windfall joy, we know not whence,
  Redeem a lifetime's rash expense,
  And, suddenly wise, the soul may mark,
  Stripped of their simulated dark,
  Mountains of gold that pierce the sky,
  Girdling its valleyed poverty
  I feel ye, childhood's hopes, return,
  With olden heats my pulses burn,--
  Mine be the self-forgetting sweep,
  The torrent impulse swift and wild,
  Wherewith Taghkanic's rockborn child
  Dares gloriously the dangerous leap,
  And, in his sky-descended mood,
  Transmutes each drop of sluggish blood,
  By touch of bravery's simple wand,
  To amethyst and diamond,
  Proving himself no bastard slip,
  But the true granite-cradled one,
  Nursed with the rock's primeval drip,
  The cloud-embracing mountain's son
  Prayer breathed in vain! no wish's sway
  Rebuilds the vanished yesterday;
  For plated wares of Sheffield stamp
  We gave the old Aladdin's lamp;
  'Tis we are changed; ah, whither went
  That undesigned abandonment,
  That wise, unquestioning content,
  Which could erect its microcosm
  Out of a weed's neglected blossom,
  Could call up Arthur and his peers
  By a low moss's clump of spears,
  Or, in its shingle trireme launched,
  Where Charles in some green inlet branched,
  Could venture for the golden fleece
  And dragon-watched Hesperides,
  Or, from its ripple-shattered fate,
  Ulysses' chances recreate?
  When, heralding life's every phase,
  There glowed a goddess-veiling haze,
  A plenteous, forewarning grace,
  Like that more tender dawn that flies
  Before the full moon's ample rise?
  Methinks thy parting glory shines
  Through yonder grove of singing pines;
  At that elm-vista's end I trace
  Dimly thy sad leave-taking face,
  Eurydice! Eurydice!
  The tremulous leaves repeat to me
  Eurydice! Eurydice!
  No gloomier Orcus swallows thee
  Than the unclouded sunset's glow;
  Thine is at least Elysian woe;
  Thou hast Good's natural decay,
  And fadest like a star away
  Into an atmosphere whose shine
  With fuller day o'ermasters thine,
  Entering defeat as 't were a shrine;
  For us,--we turn life's diary o'er
  To find but one word,--Nevermore
  As a twig trembles, which a bird
    Lights on to sing, then leaves unbent,
  So is my memory thrilled and stirred;--
    I only know she came and went
  As clasps some lake, by gusts unriven,
    The blue dome's measureless content,
  So my soul held that moment's heaven;--
    I only know she came and went
  As, at one bound, our swift spring heaps
    The orchards full of bloom and scent,
  So clove her May my wintry sleeps;--
    I only know she came and went
  An angel stood and met my gaze,
    Through the low doorway of my tent;
  The tent is struck, the vision stays;--
    I only know she came and went
  O, when the room grows slowly dim,
    And life's last oil is nearly spent,
  One gush of light these eyes will brim,
    Only to think she came and went
  I had a little daughter,
    And she was given to me
  To lead me gently backward
    To the Heavenly Father's knee,
  That I, by the force of nature,
    Might in some dim wise divine
  The depth of his infinite patience
    To this wayward soul of mine
  I know not how others saw her,
    But to me she was wholly fair,
  And the light of the heaven she came from
    Still lingered and gleamed in her hair;
  For it was as wavy and golden,
    And as many changes took,
  As the shadows of sun-gilt ripples
    On the yellow bed of a brook
  To what can I liken her smiling
    Upon me, her kneeling lover,
  How it leaped from her lips to her eyelids,
    And dimpled her wholly over,
  Till her outstretched hands smiled also,
    And I almost seemed to see
  The very heart of her mother
    Sending sun through her veins to me
  She had been with us scarce a twelvemonth,
    And it hardly seemed a day,
  When a troop of wandering angels
    Stole my little daughter away;
  Or perhaps those heavenly Zingari
    But loosed the hampering strings,
  And when they had opened her cage-door
    My little bird used her wings
  But they left in her stead a changeling,
    A little angel child,
  That seems like her bud in full blossom,
    And smiles as she never smiled:
  When I wake in the morning, I see it
    Where she always used to lie,
  And I feel as weak as a violet
    Alone 'neath the awful sky
  As weak, yet as trustful also;
    For the whole year long I see
  All the wonders of faithful Nature
    Still worked for the love of me;
  Winds wander, and dews drip earthward,
    Rain falls, suns rise and set,
  Earth whirls, and all but to prosper
    A poor little violet
  This child is not mine as the first was,
    I cannot sing it to rest,
  I cannot lift it up fatherly
    And bliss it upon my breast;
  Yet it lies in my little one's cradle
    And sits in my little one's chair,
  And the light of the heaven she's gone to
    Transfigures its golden hair
    What man would live coffined with brick and stone,
     Imprisoned from the influences of air,
     And cramped with selfish land-marks everywhere,
  When all before him stretches, furrowless and lone,
    The unmapped prairie none can fence or own
    What man would read and read the selfsame faces,
     And, like the marbles which the windmill grinds,
     Rub smooth forever with the same smooth minds,
  This year retracing last year's, every year's, dull traces,
    When there are woods and un-man-stifled places
    What man o'er one old thought would pore and pore,
     Shut like a book between its covers thin
     For every fool to leave his dog's-ears in,
  When solitude is his, and God for evermore,
    Just for the opening of a paltry door
    What man would watch life's oozy element
     Creep Letheward forever, when he might
     Down some great river drift beyond men's sight,
  To where the undethronÃ¨d forest's royal tent
    Broods with its hush o'er half a continent
    What man with men would push and altercate,
     Piecing out crooked means for crooked ends,
     When he can have the skies and woods for friends,
  Snatch back the rudder of his undismantled fate,
    And in himself be ruler, church, and state
    Cast leaves and feathers rot in last year's nest,
     The wingÃ¨d brood, flown thence, new dwellings plan;
     The serf of his own Past is not a man;
  To change and change is life, to move and never rest;--
    Not what we are, but what we hope, is best
    The wild, free woods make no man halt or blind;
     Cities rob men of eyes and hands and feet,
     Patching one whole of many incomplete;
  The general preys upon the individual mind,
    And each alone is helpless as the wind
    Each man is some man's servant; every soul
     Is by some other's presence quite discrowned;
     Each owes the next through all the imperfect round,
  Yet not with mutual help; each man is his own goal,
    And the whole earth must stop to pay his toll
    Here, life the undiminished man demands;
     New faculties stretch out to meet new wants;
     What Nature asks, that Nature also grants;
  Here man is lord, not drudge, of eyes and feet and hands,
    And to his life is knit with hourly bands
    Come out, then, from the old thoughts and old ways,
     Before you harden to a crystal cold
     Which the new life can shatter, but not mould;
  Freedom for you still waits, still, looking backward, stays,
    But widens still the irretrievable space
  Of all the myriad moods of mind
    That through the soul come thronging,
  Which one was e'er so dear, so kind,
    So beautiful as Longing?
  The thing we long for, that we are
    For one transcendent moment,
  Before the Present poor and bare
    Can make its sneering comment
  Still, through our paltry stir and strife,
    Glows down the wished Ideal,
  And Longing moulds in clay what Life
    Carves in the marble Real;
  To let the new life in, we know,
    Desire must ope the portal;--
  Perhaps the longing to be so
    Helps make the soul immortal
  Longing is God's fresh heavenward will
    With our poor earthward striving;
  We quench it that we may be still
    Content with merely living;
  But, would we learn that heart's full scope
    Which we are hourly wronging,
  Our lives must climb from hope to hope
    And realize our longing
  Ah! let us hope that to our praise
    Good God not only reckons
  The moments when we tread his ways,
    But when the spirit beckons,--
  That some slight good is also wrought
    Beyond self-satisfaction,
  When we are simply good in thought,
    Howe'er we fail in action
  As, flake by flake, the beetling avalanches
    Build up their imminent crags of noiseless snow,
  Till some chance thrill the loosened ruin launches
    And the blind havoc leaps unwarned below,
  So grew and gathered through the silent years
    The madness of a People, wrong by wrong.
  There seemed no strength in the dumb toiler's tears,--
    No strength in suffering;--but the Past was strong:
  The brute despair of trampled centuries
    Leaped up with one hoarse yell and snapped its bands,
    Groped for its right with horny, callous hands,
  And stared around for God with bloodshot eyes.
    What wonder if those palms were all too hard
  For nice distinctions,--if that mÃ¦nad throng--
    They whose thick atmosphere no bard
  Had shivered with the lightning of his song,
    Brutes with the memories and desires of men,
    Whose chronicles were writ with iron pen,
      In the crooked shoulder and the forehead low--
        Set wrong to balance wrong,
        And physicked woe with woe
  They did as they were taught; not theirs the blame,
  If men who scattered firebrands reaped the flame:
    They trampled Peace beneath their savage feet,
      And by her golden tresses drew
    Mercy along the pavement of the street.
  O, Freedom! Freedom! is thy morning-dew
      So gory red? Alas, thy light had ne'er
      Shone in upon the chaos of their lair!
  They reared to thee such symbol as they knew,
      And worshipped it with flame and blood,
      A Vengeance, axe in hand, that stood
  Holding a tyrant's head up by the clotted hair
  What wrongs the Oppressor suffered, these we know;
    These have found piteous voice in song and prose;
  But for the Oppressed, their darkness and their woe,
    Their grinding centuries,--what Muse had those?
  Though hall and palace had nor eyes nor ears,
    Hardening a people's heart to senseless stone,
  Thou knowest them, O Earth, that drank their tears,
    O Heaven, that heard their inarticulate moan!
  They noted down their fetters, link by link;
  Coarse was the hand that scrawled, and red the ink;
    Rude was their score, as suits unlettered men,--
  Notched with a headman's axe upon a block:
  What marvel if, when came the avenging shock,
   'Twas Ate, not Urania, held the pen
  With eye averted and an anguished frown,
    Loathingly glides the Muse through scenes of strife,
  Where, like the heart of Vengeance up and down,
    Throbs in its framework the blood-muffled knife;
  Slow are the steps of Freedom, but her feet
    Turn never backward: hers no bloody glare;
  Her light is calm, and innocent, and sweet,
    And where it enters there is no despair:
  Not first on palace and cathedral spire
  Quivers and gleams that unconsuming fire;
    While these stand black against her morning skies,
  The peasant sees it leap from peak to peak
    Along his hills; the craftsman's burning eyes
  Own with cool tears its influence mother-meek;
    It lights the poet's heart up like a star;--
    Ah! while the tyrant deemed it still afar,
  And twined with golden threads his futile snare,
    That swift, convicting glow all round him ran;
     'Twas close beside him there,
  Sunrise whose Memnon is the soul of man
  O Broker-King, is this thy wisdom's fruit?
    A dynasty plucked out as 't were a weed
    Grown rankly in a night, that leaves no seed!
  Could eighteen years strike down no deeper root?
    But now thy vulture eye was turned on Spain,--
  A shout from Paris, and thy crown falls off,
    Thy race has ceased to reign,
  And thou become a fugitive and scoff:
    Slippery the feet that mount by stairs of gold,
  And weakest of all fences one of steel;--
    Go and keep school again like him of old,
  The Syracusan tyrant;--thou mayst feel
  Royal amid a birch-swayed commonweal
  Not long can he be ruler who allows
    His time to run before him; thou wast naught
  Soon as the strip of gold about thy brows
    Was no more emblem of the People's thought:
  Vain were thy bayonets against the foe
    Thou hadst to cope with; thou didst wage
  War not with Frenchmen merely;--no,
    Thy strife was with the Spirit of the Age,
  The invisible Spirit whose first breath divine
      Scattered thy frail endeavor,
  And, like poor last year's leaves, whirled thee and thine
        Into the Dark forever
    Is here no triumph? Nay, what though
  The yellow blood of Trade meanwhile should pour
    Along its arteries a shrunken flow,
  And the idle canvas droop around the shore?
        These do not make a state,
        Nor keep it great;
        I think God made
      The earth for man, not trade;
    And where each humblest human creature
    Can stand, no more suspicious or afraid,
    Erect and kingly in his right of nature,
  To heaven and earth knit with harmonious ties,--
    Where I behold the exultation
    Of manhood glowing in those eyes
      That had been dark for ages,--
      Or only lit with bestial loves and rages--
    There I behold a Nation:
        The France which lies
      Between the Pyrenees and Rhine
        Is the least part of France;
  I see her rather in the soul whose shine
  Burns through the craftsman's grimy countenance,
    In the new energy divine
      Of Toil's enfranchised glance
      And if it be a dream,--
    If the great Future be the little Past
   'Neath a new mask, which drops and shows at last
    The same weird, mocking face to balk and blast,--
  Yet, Muse, a gladder measure suits the theme,
      And the TyrtÃ¦an harp
      Loves notes more resolute and sharp,
  Throbbing, as throbs the bosom, hot and fast:
      Such visions are of morning,
      Theirs is no vague forewarning,
  The dreams which nations dream come true,
        And shape the world anew;
          If this be a sleep,
          Make it long, make it deep,
  O Father, who sendest the harvests men reap!
        While Labor so sleepeth
        His sorrow is gone,
      No longer he weepeth,
      But smileth and steepeth
        His thoughts in the dawn;
      He heareth Hope yonder
        Rain, lark-like, her fancies,
      His dreaming hands wander
        Mid heart's-ease and pansies;
     "'Tis a dream! 'Tis a vision!"
        Shrieks Mammon aghast;
     "The day's broad derision
        Will chase it at last;
      Ye are mad, ye have taken,
      A slumbering kraken
        For firm land of the Past!"
      Ah! if he awaken,
        God shield us all then,
      If this dream rudely shaken
        Shall cheat him again
    Since first I heard our North wind blow,
    Since first I saw Atlantic throw
    On our fierce rocks his thunderous snow,
    I loved thee, Freedom; as a boy
  The rattle of thy shield at Marathon
      Did with a Grecian joy
      Through all my pulses run;
  But I have learned to love thee now
  Without the helm upon thy gleaming brow,
      A maiden mild and undefiled
  Like her who bore the world's redeeming child;
    And surely never did thy altars glance
    With purer fires than now in France;
    While, in their bright white flashes,
      Wrong's shadow, backward cast,
    Waves cowering o'er the ashes
      Of the dead, blaspheming Past,
    O'er the shapes of fallen giants,
      His own unburied brood,
    Whose dead hands clench defiance
      At the overpowering Good:
  And down the happy future runs a flood
    Of prophesying light;
  It shows an Earth no longer stained with blood,
  Blossom and fruit where now we see the bud
    Of Brotherhood and Right
  Said Christ our Lord, "I will go and see
  How the men, my brethren, believe in me."
  He passed not again through the gate of birth,
  But made himself known to the children of earth
  Then said the chief priests, and rulers, and kings,
  "Behold, now, the Giver of all good things;
  Go to, let us welcome with pomp and state
  Him who alone is mighty and great
  With carpets of gold the ground they spread
  Wherever the Son of Man should tread,
  And in palace-chambers lofty and rare
  They lodged him, and served him with kingly fare
  Great organs surged through arches dim
  Their jubilant floods in praise of him,
  And in church and palace, and judgment-hall,
  He saw his image high over all
  But still, wherever his steps they led,
  The Lord in sorrow bent down his head,
  And from under the heavy foundation-stones,
  The son of Mary heard bitter groans
  And in church and palace, and judgment-hall,
  He marked great fissures that rent the wall,
  And opened wider and yet more wide
  As the living foundation heaved and sighed
  "Have ye founded your thrones and altars, then,
  On the bodies and souls of living men?
  And think ye that building shall endure,
  Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor
  "With gates of silver and bars of gold,
  Ye have fenced my sheep from their Father's fold:
  I have heard the dropping of their tears
  In heaven, these eighteen hundred years
  "O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt,
  We build but as our fathers built;
  Behold thine images, how they stand,
  Sovereign and sole, through all our land
  "Our task is hard,--with sword and flame
  To hold thy earth forever the same,
  And with sharp crooks of steel to keep
  Still, as thou leftest them, thy sheep
  Then Christ sought out an artisan,
  A low-browed, stunted, haggard man,
  And a motherless girl, whose fingers thin
  Pushed from her faintly want and sin
  These set he in the midst of them,
  And as they drew back their garment-hem,
  For fear of defilement, "Lo, here," said he,
  "The images ye have made of me
  My name is Water: I have sped
    Through strange, dark ways, untried before,
  By pure desire of friendship led,
    Cochituate's ambassador;
  He sends four royal gifts by me:
  Long life, health, peace, and purity
  I'm Ceres' cup-bearer; I pour,
    For flowers and fruits and all their kin,
  Her crystal vintage, from of yore
    Stored in old Earth's selectest bin,
  Flora's Falernian ripe, since God
  The wine-press of the deluge trod
  In that far isle whence, iron-willed,
    The New World's sires their bark unmoored,
  The fairies' acorn-cups I filled
    Upon the toadstool's silver board,
  And, 'neath Herne's oak, for Shakspeare's sight,
  Strewed moss and grass with diamonds bright
  No fairies in the Mayflower came,
    And, lightsome as I sparkle here,
  For Mother Bay-State, busy dame,
    I've toiled and drudged this many a year,
  Throbbed in her engines' iron veins,
  Twirled myriad spindles for her gains
  I, too, can weave; the warp I set
    Through which the sun his shuttle throws,
  And, bright as Noah saw it, yet
    For you the arching rainbow glows,
  A sight in Paradise denied
  To unfallen Adam and his bride
  When Winter held me in his grip,
    You seized and sent me o'er the wave,
  Ungrateful! in a prison-ship;
    But I forgive, not long a slave,
  For, soon as summer south-winds blew,
  Homeward I fled, disguised as dew
  For countless services I'm fit,
    Of use, of pleasure, and of gain,
  But lightly from all bonds I flit,
    Nor lose my mirth, nor feel a stain;
  From mill and wash-tub I escape,
  And take in heaven my proper shape
  So, free myself, to-day, elate
    I come from far o'er hill and mead,
  And here, Cochituate's envoy, wait
    To be your blithesome Ganymede,
  And brim your cups with nectar true
  That never will make slaves of you
  The same good blood that now refills
  The dotard Orient's shrunken veins,
  The same whose vigor westward thrills,
  Bursting Nevada's silver chains,
  Poured here upon the April grass,
  Freckled with red the herbage new;
  On reeled the battle's trampling mass,
  Back to the ash the bluebird new
  Poured here in vain;--that sturdy blood
  Was meant to make the earth more green,
  But in a higher, gentler mood
  Than broke this April noon serene;
  Two graves are here; to mark the place,
  At head and foot, an unhewn stone,
  O'er which the herald lichens trace
  The blazon of Oblivion
  These men were brave enough, and true
  To the hired soldier's bull-dog creed;
  What brought them here they never knew,
  They fought as suits the English breed;
  They came three thousand miles, and died,
  To keep the Past upon its throne;
  Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,
  Their English mother made her moan
  The turf that covers them no thrill
  Sends up to fire the heart and brain;
  No stronger purpose nerves the will,
  No hope renews its youth again:
  From farm to farm the Concord glides,
  And trails my fancy with its flow;
  O'erhead the balanced henhawk slides,
  Twinned in the river's heaven below
  But go, whose Bay-State bosom stirs,
  Proud of thy birth and neighbor's right,
  Where sleep the heroic villagers
  Borne red and stiff from Concord fight;
  Thought Reuben, snatching down his gun,
  Or Seth, as ebbed the life away,
  What earthquake rifts would shoot and run
  World-wide from that short April fray
  What then? With heart and hand they wrought
  According to their village light;
  'Twas for the Future that they fought,
  Their rustic faith in what was right.
  Upon earth's tragic stage they burst
  Unsummoned, in the humble sock;
  Theirs the fifth act; the curtain first
  Rose long ago on Charles's block
  Their graves have voices; if they threw
  Dice charged with fates beyond their ken,
  Yet to their instincts they were true,
  And had the genius to be men.
  Fine privilege of Freedom's host,
  Of even foot-soldiers for the Right!--
  For centuries dead, ye are not lost,
  Your graves send courage forth, and might
  We, too, have autumns, when our leaves
    Drop loosely through the dampened air,
  When all our good seems bound in sheaves,
    And we stand reaped and bare
  Our seasons have no fixed returns,
    Without our will they come and go;
  At noon our sudden summer burns,
    Ere sunset all is snow
  But each day brings less summer cheer,
    Crimps more our ineffectual spring,
  And something earlier every year
    Our singing birds take wing
  As less the olden glow abides,
    And less the chillier heart aspires,
  With drift-wood beached in past spring-tides
    We light our sullen fires
  By the pinched rushlight's starving beam
    We cower and strain our wasted sight,
  To stitch youth's shroud up, seam by seam,
    In the long arctic night
  It was not so--we once were young--
    When Spring, to womanly Summer turning,
  Her dew-drops on each grass-blade strung,
    In the red sunrise burning
  We trusted then, aspired, believed
    That earth could be remade to-morrow;--
  Ah, why be ever undeceived?
    Why give up faith for sorrow
  O thou, whose days are yet all spring,
    Faith, blighted once, is past retrieving;
  Experience is a dumb, dead thing;
    The victory's in believing
  Are we, then, wholly fallen? Can it be
  That thou, North wind, that from thy mountains bringest
  Their spirit to our plains, and thou, blue sea,
  Who on our rocks thy wreaths of freedom flingest,
  As on an altar,--can it be that ye
  Have wasted inspiration on dead ears,
  Dulled with the too familiar clank of chains?
  The people's heart is like a harp for years
  Hung where some petrifying torrent rains
  Its slow-incrusting spray: the stiffened chords
  Faint and more faint make answer to the tears
  That drip upon them: idle are all words;
  Only a silver plectrum wakes the tone
  Deep buried 'neath that ever-thickening stone
  We are not free: Freedom doth not consist
  In musing with our faces toward the Past,
  While petty cares, and crawling interests, twist
  Their spider-threads about us, which at last
  Grow strong as iron chains, to cramp and bind
  In formal narrowness heart, soul, and mind.
  Freedom is recreated year by year,
  In hearts wide open on the Godward side,
  In souls calm-cadenced as the whirling sphere,
  In minds that sway the future like a tide.
  No broadest creeds can hold her, and no codes;
  She chooses men for her august abodes,
  Building them fair and fronting to the dawn;
  Yet, when we seek her, we but find a few
  Light footprints, leading morn-ward through the dew;
  Before the day had risen, she was gone
  And we must follow: swiftly runs she on,
  And, if our steps should slacken in despair,
  Half turns her face, half smiles through golden hair,
  Forever yielding, never wholly won:
  That is not love which pauses in the race
  Two close-linked names on fleeting sand to trace;
  Freedom gained yesterday is no more ours;
  Men gather but dry seeds of last year's flowers:
  Still there's a charm ungranted, still a grace,
  Still rosy Hope, the free, the unattained,
  Makes us Possession's languid hand let fall;
  'Tis but a fragment of ourselves is gained,--
  The Future brings us more, but never all
  And, as the finder of some unknown realm,
  Mounting a summit whence he thinks to see
  On either side of him the imprisoning sea,
  Beholds, above the clouds that overwhelm
  The valley-land, peak after snowy peak
  Stretch out of sight, each like a silver helm
  Beneath its plume of smoke, sublime and bleak,
  And what he thought an island finds to be
  A continent to him first oped,--so we
  Can from our height of Freedom look along
  A boundless future, ours if we be strong;
  Or if we shrink, better remount our ships
  And, fleeing God's express design, trace back
  The hero-freighted Mayflower's prophet-track
  To Europe, entering her blood-red eclipse
  Bowing thyself in dust before a Book,
  And thinking the great God is thine alone,
  O rash iconoclast, thou wilt not brook
  What gods the heathen carves in wood and stone,
  As if the Shepherd who from outer cold
  Leads all his shivering lambs to one sure fold
  Were careful for the fashion of his crook
  There is no broken reed so poor and base,
  No rush, the bending tilt of swamp-fly blue,
  But he therewith the ravening wolf can chase,
  And guide his flock to springs and pastures new;
  Through ways unlooked for, and through many lands,
  Far from the rich folds built with human hands,
  The gracious footprints of his love I trace
  And what art thou, own brother of the clod,
  That from his hand the crook wouldst snatch away
  And shake instead thy dry and sapless rod,
  To scare the sheep out of the wholesome day?
  Yea, what art thou, blind, unconverted Jew,
  That with thy idol-volume's covers two
  Wouldst make a jail to coop the living God
  Thou hear'st not well the mountain organ-tones
  By prophet ears from Hor and Sinai caught,
  Thinking the cisterns of those Hebrew brains
  Drew dry the springs of the All-knower's thought,
  Nor shall thy lips be touched with living fire,
  Who blow'st old altar-coals with sole desire
  To weld anew the spirit's broken chains
  God is not dumb, that he should speak no more;
  If thou hast wanderings in the wilderness
  And find'st not Sinai, 'tis thy soul is poor;
  There towers the mountain of the Voice no less,
  Which whoso seeks shall find, but he who bends,
  Intent on manna still and mortal ends,
  Sees it not, neither hears its thundered lore
  Slowly the Bible of the race is writ,
  And not on paper leaves nor leaves of stone;
  Each age, each kindred adds a verse to it,
  Texts of despair or hope, of joy or moan.
  While swings the sea, while mists the mountains shroud,
  While thunder's surges burst on cliffs of cloud,
  Still at the prophets' feet the nations sit
  Hushed with broad sunlight lies the hill,
  And, minuting the long day's loss,
  The cedar's shadow, slow and still,
  Creeps o'er its dial of gray moss
  Warm noon brims full the valley's cup,
  The aspen's leaves are scarce astir,
  Only the little mill sends up
  Its busy, never-ceasing burr
  Climbing the loose-piled wall that hems
  The road along the mill-pond's brink,
  From 'neath the arching barberry-stems,
  My footstep scares the shy chewink
  Beneath a bony buttonwood
  The mill's red door lets forth the din;
  The whitened miller, dust-imbued,
  Flits past the square of dark within
  No mountain torrent's strength is here;
  Sweet Beaver, child of forest still,
  Heaps its small pitcher to the ear,
  And gently waits the miller's will
  Swift slips Undine along the race
  Unheard, and then, with flashing bound,
  Floods the dull wheel with light and grace,
  And, laughing, hunts the loath drudge round
  The miller dreams not at what cost
  The quivering mill-stones hum and whirl,
  Nor how for every turn, are tost
  Armfuls of diamond and of pearl
  But Summer cleared my happier eyes
  With drops of some celestial juice,
  To see how Beauty underlies
  For evermore each form of Use
  And more: methought I saw that flood,
  Which now so dull and darkling steals,
  Thick, here and there, with human blood,
  To turn the world's laborious wheels
  No more than doth the miller there,
  Shut in our several cells, do we
  Know with what waste of beauty rare
  Moves every day's machinery
  Surely the wiser time shall come
  When this fine overplus of might,
  No longer sullen, slow, and dumb,
  Shall leap to music and to light
  In that new childhood of the Earth
  Life of itself shall dance and play;
  Fresh blood in Time's shrunk veins make mirth,
  And labor meet delight half-way
  How looks Appledore in a storm?
    I have seen it when its crags seemed frantic,
    Butting against the maddened Atlantic,
  When surge after surge would heap enorme,
    Cliffs of Emerald topped with snow,
    That lifted and lifted and then let go
  A great white avalanche of thunder,
    A grinding, blinding, deafening ire
  Monadnock might have trembled under;
    And the island, whose rock-roots pierce below
    To where they are warmed with the central fire,
  You could feel its granite fibres racked,
    As it seemed to plunge with a shudder and thrill
    Right at the breast of the swooping hill,
  And to rise again, snorting a cataract
  Of rage-froth from every cranny and ledge,
    While the sea drew its breath in hoarse and deep,
  And the next vast breaker curled its edge,
    Gathering itself for a mighty leap
  North, east, and south there are reefs and breakers,
    You would never dream of in smooth weather,
  That toss and gore the sea for acres,
    Bellowing and gnashing and snarling together;
  Look northward, where Duck Island lies,
  And over its crown you will see arise,
  Against a background of slaty skies,
    A row of pillars still and white
    That glimmer and then are out of sight,
  As if the moon should suddenly kiss,
    While you crossed the gusty desert by night,
  The long colonnades of Persepolis,
  And then as sudden a darkness should follow
  To gulp the whole scene at single swallow,
  The city's ghost, the drear, brown waste,
  And the string of camels, clumsy-paced:--
  Look southward for White Island light,
    The lantern stands ninety feet o'er the tide;
  There is first a half-mile of tumult and fight,
  Of dash and roar and tumble and fright,
    And surging bewilderment wild and wide,
  Where the breakers struggle left and right,
    Then a mile or more of rushing sea,
  And then the light-house slim and lone;
  And whenever the whole weight of ocean is thrown
  Full and fair on White Island head,
    A great mist-jotun you will see
    Lifting himself up silently
  High and huge o'er the light-house top,
  With hands of wavering spray outspread,
    Groping after the little tower,
    That seems to shrink, and shorten and cower,
  Till the monster's arms of a sudden drop,
    And silently and fruitlessly
    He sinks again into the sea
  You, meanwhile, where drenched you stand,
    Awaken once more to the rush and roar
  And on the rock-point tighten your hand,
  As you turn and see a valley deep,
    That was not there a moment before,
  Suck rattling down between you and a heap
    Of toppling billow, whose instant fall
    Must sink the whole island once for all--
  Or watch the silenter, stealthier seas
    Feeling their way to you more and more;
  If they once should clutch you high as the knees
  They would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp,
  Beyond all reach of hope or help;--
    And such in a storm is Appledore
  When Persia's sceptre trembled in a hand
  Wilted by harem-heats, and all the land
    Was hovered over by those vulture ills
  That snuff decaying empire from afar,
  Then, with a nature balanced as a star,
    Dara arose, a shepherd of the hills
  He, who had governed fleecy subjects well,
  Made his own village, by the self-same spell,
    Secure and peaceful as a guarded fold,
  Till, gathering strength by slow and wise degrees,
  Under his sway, to neighbor villages
    Order returned, and faith and justice old
  Now, when it fortuned that a king more wise
  Endued the realm with brain and hands and eyes,
    He sought on every side men brave and just,
  And having heard the mountain-shepherd's praise,
  How he rendered the mould of elder days,
    To Dara gave a satrapy in trust
  So Dara shepherded a province wide,
  Nor in his viceroy's sceptre took more pride
    Than in his crook before; but Envy finds
  More soil in cities than on mountains bare,
  And the frank sun of spirits clear and rare
    Breeds poisonous fogs in low and marish minds
  Soon it was whispered at the royal ear
  That, though wise Dara's province, year by year,
    Like a great sponge, drew wealth and plenty up,
  Yet, when he squeezed it at the king's behest,
  Some golden drops, more rich than all the rest,
    Went to the filling of his private cup
  For proof, they said that whereso'er he went
  A chest, beneath whose weight the camel bent,
    Went guarded, and no other eye had seen
  What was therein, save only Dara's own,
  Yet, when 'twas opened, all his tent was known
    To glow and lighten with heapt jewels' sheen
  The king set forth for Dara's province straight,
  Where, as was fit, outside his city's gate
    The viceroy met him with a stately train;
  And there, with archers circled, close at hand,
  A camel with the chest was seen to stand,
    The king grew red, for thus the guilt was plain
  "Open me now," he cried, "yon treasure-chest!"
  'Twas done, and only a worn shepherd's vest
    Was found within; some blushed and hung the head,
  Not Dara; open as the sky's blue roof
  He stood, and "O, my lord, behold the proof
    That I was worthy of my trust!" he said
  "For ruling men, lo! all the charm I had;
  My soul, in those coarse vestments ever clad,
    Still to the unstained past kept true and leal,
  Still on these plains could breathe her mountain air,
  And Fortune's heaviest gifts serenely bear,
    Which bend men from the truth, and make them reel
  "To govern wisely I had shown small skill
  Were I not lord of simple Dara still;
    That sceptre kept, I cannot lose my way!"
  Strange dew in royal eyes grew round, and bright
  And thrilled the trembling lids; before 'twas night
    Two added provinces blest Dara's sway
  Nine years have slipped like hour-glass sand
    From life's fast-emptying globe away,
  Since last, dear friend, I clasped your hand,
  And lingered on the impoverished land,
    Watching the steamer down the bay
  I held the keepsake which you gave,
    Until the dim smoke-pennon curled
  O'er the vague rim 'tween sky and wave,
  And closed the distance like a grave,
    Leaving me to the outer world
  The old worn world of hurry and heat,
    The young, fresh world of thought and scope;
  While you, where silent surges fleet
  Toward far sky beaches still and sweet,
    Sunk wavering down the ocean-slope
  Come back our ancient walks to tread,
    Old haunts of lost or scattered friends,
  Amid the Muses' factories red,
  Where song, and smoke, and laughter sped
    The nights to proctor-hunted ends
  Our old familiars are not laid,
    Though snapped our wands and sunk our books,
  They beckon, not to be gainsaid,
  Where, round broad meads which mowers wade,
    Smooth Charles his steel-blue sickle crooks
  Where, as the cloudbergs eastward blow,
    From glow to gloom the hillside shifts
  Its lakes of rye that surge and flow,
  Its plumps of orchard-trees arow,
    Its snowy white-weed's summer drifts
  Or let us to Nantasket, there
    To wander idly as we list,
  Whether, on rocky hillocks bare,
  Sharp cedar-points, like breakers, tear
    The trailing fringes of gray mist
  Or whether, under skies clear-blown,
    The heightening surfs with foamy din,
  Their breeze-caught forelocks backward blown
  Against old Neptune's yellow zone,
    Curl slow, and plunge forever in
  For years thrice three, wise Horace said,
    A poem rare let silence bind;
  And love may ripen in the shade,
  Like ours, for nine long seasons laid
    In crypts and arches of the mind
  That right Falernian friendship old
    Will we, to grace our feast, call up,
  And freely pour the juice of gold,
  That keeps life's pulses warm and bold,
    Till Death shall break the empty cup
Morning and evening
    Maids heard the goblins cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy:
    Apples and quinces,
    Lemons and oranges,
    Plump unpecked cherries,
    Melons and raspberries,
    Bloom-down-cheeked peaches,
    Swart-headed mulberries,
    Wild free-born cranberries,
    Crab-apples, dewberries,
    Pine-apples, blackberries,
    Apricots, strawberries;--
    All ripe together
    In summer weather,--
    Morns that pass by,
    Fair eves that fly;
    Come buy, come buy:
    Our grapes fresh from the vine,
    Pomegranates full and fine,
    Dates and sharp bullaces,
    Rare pears and greengages,
    Damsons and bilberries,
    Taste them and try:
    Currants and gooseberries,
    Bright-fire-like barberries,
    Figs to fill your mouth,
    Citrons from the South,
    Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;
    Come buy, come buy
      Evening by evening
    Among the brookside rushes,
    Laura bowed her head to hear,
    Lizzie veiled her blushes:
    Crouching close together
    In the cooling weather,
    With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
    With tingling cheeks and finger-tips.
    "Lie close," Laura said,
    Pricking up her golden head:
    "We must not look at goblin men,
    We must not buy their fruits:
    Who knows upon what soil they fed
    Their hungry thirsty roots?"
    "Come buy," call the goblins
    Hobbling down the glen.
    "O," cried Lizzie, "Laura, Laura,
    You should not peep at goblin men."
    Lizzie covered up her eyes,
    Covered close lest they should look;
    Laura reared her glossy head,
    And whispered like the restless brook:
    "Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
    Down the glen tramp little men.
    One hauls a basket,
    One bears a plate,
    One lugs a golden dish
    Of many pounds' weight.
    How fair the vine must grow
    Whose grapes are so luscious;
    How warm the wind must blow
    Through those fruit bushes."
    "No," said Lizzie, "no, no, no;
    Their offers should not charm us,
    Their evil gifts would harm us."
    She thrust a dimpled finger
    In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
    Curious Laura chose to linger
    Wondering at each merchant man.
    One had a cat's face,
    One whisked a tail,
    One tramped at a rat's pace,
    One crawled like a snail,
    One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,
    One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry.
    She heard a voice like voice of doves
    Cooing all together:
    They sounded kind and full of loves
    In the pleasant weather
      Laura stretched her gleaming neck
    Like a rush-imbedded swan,
    Like a lily from the beck,
    Like a moonlit poplar branch,
    Like a vessel at the launch
    When its last restraint is gone
      Backwards up the mossy glen
    Turned and trooped the goblin men,
    With their shrill repeated cry,
    "Come buy, come buy."
    When they reached where Laura was
    They stood stock still upon the moss,
    Leering at each other,
    Brother with queer brother;
    Signalling each other,
    Brother with sly brother.
    One set his basket down,
    One reared his plate;
    One began to weave a crown
    Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
    (Men sell not such in any town);
    One heaved the golden weight
    Of dish and fruit to offer her:
    "Come buy, come buy," was still their cry.
    Laura stared but did not stir,
    Longed but had no money:
    The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste
    In tones as smooth as honey,
    The cat-faced purr'd,
    The rat-paced spoke a word
    Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
    One parrot-voiced and jolly
    Cried "Pretty Goblin" still for "Pretty Polly";--
    One whistled like a bird
      But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
    "Good folk, I have no coin;
    To take were to purloin:
    I have no copper in my purse,
    I have no silver either,
    And all my gold is on the furze
    That shakes in windy weather
    Above the rusty heather."
    "You have much gold upon your head,"
    They answered altogether:
    "Buy from us with a golden curl."
    She clipped a precious golden lock,
    She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,
    Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:
    Sweeter than honey from the rock,
    Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
    Clearer than water flowed that juice;
    She never tasted such before,
    How should it cloy with length of use?
    She sucked and sucked and sucked the more
    Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
    She sucked until her lips were sore;
    Then flung the emptied rinds away,
    But gathered up one kernel stone,
    And knew not was it night or day
    As she turned home alone
      Lizzie met her at the gate
    Full of wise upbraidings:
    "Dear, you should not stay so late,
    Twilight is not good for maidens;
    Should not loiter in the glen
    In the haunts of goblin men.
    Do you not remember Jeanie,
    How she met them in the moonlight,
    Took their gifts both choice and many,
    Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
    Plucked from bowers
    Where summer ripens at all hours?
    But ever in the noonlight
    She pined and pined away;
    Sought them by night and day,
    Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray,
    Then fell with the first snow,
    While to this day no grass will grow
    Where she lies low:
    I planted daisies there a year ago
    That never blow.
    You should not loiter so."
    "Nay, hush," said Laura:
    "Nay, hush, my sister:
    I ate and ate my fill,
    Yet my mouth waters still;
    To-morrow night I will
    Buy more,"--and kissed her.
    "Have done with sorrow;
    I'll bring you plums to-morrow
    Fresh on their mother twigs,
    Cherries worth getting;
    You cannot think what figs
    My teeth have met in,
    What melons icy-cold
    Piled on a dish of gold
    Too huge for me to hold,
    What peaches with a velvet nap,
    Pellucid grapes without one seed:
    Odorous indeed must be the mead
    Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink,
    With lilies at the brink,
    And sugar-sweet their sap
      Golden head by golden head,
    Like two pigeons in one nest
    Folded in each other's wings,
    They lay down in their curtained bed:
    Like two blossoms on one stem,
    Like two flakes of new-fallen snow,
    Like two wands of ivory
    Tipped with gold for awful kings.
    Moon and stars gazed in at them,
    Wind sang to them lullaby,
    Lumbering owls forbore to fly,
    Not a bat flapped to and fro
    Round their rest:
    Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
    Locked together in one nest
      Early in the morning
    When the first cock crowed his warning,
    Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,
    Laura rose with Lizzie:
    Fetched in honey, milked the cows,
    Aired and set to rights the house,
    Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,
    Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,
    Next churned butter, whipped up cream,
    Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;
    Talked as modest maidens should:
    Lizzie with an open heart,
    Laura in an absent dream,
    One content, one sick in part;
    One warbling for the mere bright day's delight,
    One longing for the night
      At length slow evening came:
    They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
    Lizzie most placid in her look,
    Laura most like a leaping flame.
    They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
    Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,
    Then turning homeward said: "The sunset flushes
    Those furthest loftiest crags;
    Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,
    No wilful squirrel wags,
    The beasts and birds are fast asleep."
    But Laura loitered still among the rushes
    And said the bank was steep
      And said the hour was early still,
    The dew not fallen, the wind not chill:
    Listening ever, but not catching
    The customary cry,
    "Come buy, come buy,"
    With its iterated jingle
    Of sugar-baited words:
    Not for all her watching
    Once discerning even one goblin
    Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;
    Let alone the herds
    That used to tramp along the glen,
    In groups or single,
    Of brisk fruit-merchant men
      Till Lizzie urged: "O Laura, come;
    I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look:
    You should not loiter longer at this brook:
    Come with me home.
    The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,
    Each glow-worm winks her spark,
    Let us get home before the night grows dark;
    For clouds may gather
    Though this is summer weather,
    Put out the lights and drench us through;
    Then if we lost our way what should we do
      Laura turned cold as stone
    To find her sister heard that cry alone,
    That goblin cry,
    "Come buy our fruits, come buy."
    Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
    Must she no more such succous pasture find,
    Gone deaf and blind?
    Her tree of life drooped from the root:
    She said not one word in her heart's sore ache;
    But peering thro' the dimness, naught discerning,
    Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;
    So crept to bed, and lay
    Silent till Lizzie slept;
    Then sat up in a passionate yearning,
    And gnashed her teeth for balked desire, and wept
    As if her heart would break
      Day after day, night after night,
    Laura kept watch in vain,
    In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
    She never caught again the goblin cry:
    "Come buy, come buy";--
    She never spied the goblin men
    Hawking their fruits along the glen:
    But when the noon waxed bright
    Her hair grew thin and gray;
    She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
    To swift decay, and burn
    Her fire away
      One day remembering her kernel-stone
    She set it by a wall that faced the south;
    Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,
    Watched for a waxing shoot,
    But there came none;
    It never saw the sun,
    It never felt the trickling moisture run:
    While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
    She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees
    False waves in desert drouth
    With shade of leaf-crowned trees,
    And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze
      She no more swept the house,
    Tended the fowls or cows,
    Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,
    Brought water from the brook:
    But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
    And would not eat
      Tender Lizzie could not bear
    To watch her sister's cankerous care,
    Yet not to share.
    She night and morning
    Caught the goblins' cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy."
    Beside the brook, along the glen,
    She heard the tramp of goblin men,
    The voice and stir
    Poor Laura could not hear;
    Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,
    But feared to pay too dear.
    She thought of Jeanie in her grave,
    Who should have been a bride;
    But who for joys brides hope to have
    Fell sick and died
    In her gay prime,
    In earliest winter-time,
    With the first glazing rime,
    With the first snow-fall of crisp winter-time
      Till Laura, dwindling,
    Seemed knocking at Death's door:
    Then Lizzie weighed no more
    Better and worse,
    But put a silver penny in her purse,
    Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze
    At twilight, halted by the brook;
    And for the first time in her life
    Began to listen and look
      Laughed every goblin
    When they spied her peeping:
    Came towards her hobbling,
    Flying, running, leaping,
    Puffing and blowing,
    Chuckling, clapping, crowing,
    Clucking and gobbling,
    Mopping and mowing,
    Full of airs and graces,
    Pulling wry faces,
    Demure grimaces,
    Cat-like and rat-like,
    Ratel and wombat-like,
    Snail-paced in a hurry,
    Parrot-voiced and whistler,
    Helter-skelter, hurry-skurry,
    Chattering like magpies,
    Fluttering like pigeons,
    Gliding like fishes,--
    Hugged her and kissed her;
    Squeezed and caressed her;
    Stretched up their dishes,
    Panniers and plates:
    "Look at our apples
    Russet and dun,
    Bob at our cherries,
    Bite at our peaches,
    Citrons and dates,
    Grapes for the asking,
    Pears red with basking
    Out in the sun,
    Plums on their twigs;
    Pluck them and suck them,
    Pomegranates, figs
      "Good folk," said Lizzie,
    Mindful of Jeanie,
    "Give me much and many";--
    Held out her apron,
    Tossed them her penny.
    "Nay, take a seat with us,
    Honor and eat with us,"
    They answered grinning:
    "Our feast is but beginning.
    Night yet is early,
    Warm and dew-pearly,
    Wakeful and starry:
    Such fruits as these
    No man can carry;
    Half their bloom would fly,
    Half their dew would dry,
    Half their flavor would pass by.
    Sit down and feast with us,
    Be welcome guest with us,
    Cheer you and rest with us."
    "Thank you," said Lizzie; "but one waits
    At home alone for me:
    So, without further parleying,
    If you will not sell me any
    Of your fruits though much and many,
    Give me back my silver penny
    I tossed you for a fee."
    They began to scratch their pates,
    No longer wagging, purring,
    But visibly demurring,
    Grunting and snarling.
    One called her proud,
    Cross-grained, uncivil;
    Their tones waxed loud,
    Their looks were evil.
    Lashing their tails
    They trod and hustled her,
    Elbowed and jostled her,
    Clawed with their nails,
    Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,
    Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,
    Twitched her hair out by the roots,
    Stamped upon her tender feet,
    Held her hands and squeezed their fruits
    Against her mouth to make her eat
      White and golden Lizzie stood,
    Like a lily in a flood,--
    Like a rock of blue-veined stone
    Lashed by tides obstreperously,--
    Like a beacon left alone
    In a hoary roaring sea,
    Sending up a golden fire,--
    Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
    White with blossoms honey-sweet
    Sore beset by wasp and bee,--
    Like a royal virgin town
    Topped with gilded dome and spire
    Close beleaguered by a fleet
    Mad to tug her standard down
      One may lead a horse to water,
    Twenty cannot make him drink.
    Though the goblins cuffed and caught her,
    Coaxed and fought her,
    Bullied and besought her,
    Scratched her, pinched her black as ink,
    Kicked and knocked her,
    Mauled and mocked her,
    Lizzie uttered not a word;
    Would not open lip from lip
    Lest they should cram a mouthful in;
    But laughed in heart to feel the drip
    Of juice that syrupped all her face,
    And lodged in dimples of her chin,
    And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.
    At last the evil people,
    Worn out by her resistance,
    Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit
    Along whichever road they took,
    Not leaving root or stone or shoot.
    Some writhed into the ground,
    Some dived into the brook
    With ring and ripple,
    Some scudded on the gale without a sound,
    Some vanished in the distance
      In a smart, ache, tingle,
    Lizzie went her way;
    Knew not was it night or day;
    Sprang up the bank, tore through the furze,
    Threaded copse and dingle,
    And heard her penny jingle
    Bouncing in her purse,--
    Its bounce was music to her ear.
    She ran and ran
    As if she feared some goblin man
    Dogged her with gibe or curse
    Or something worse:
    But not one goblin skurried after,
    Nor was she pricked by fear;
    The kind heart made her windy-paced
    That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
    And inward laughter
      She cried "Laura," up the garden,
    "Did you miss me?
    Come and kiss me.
    Never mind my bruises,
    Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices
    Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,
    Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
    Eat me, drink me, love me;
    Laura, make much of me:
    For your sake I have braved the glen
    And had to do with goblin merchant men
      Laura started from her chair,
    Flung her arms up in the air,
    Clutched her hair:
    "Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted
    For my sake the fruit forbidden?
    Must your light like mine be hidden,
    Your young life like mine be wasted,
    Undone in mine undoing
    And ruined in my ruin,
    Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?"
    She clung about her sister,
    Kissed and kissed and kissed her:
    Tears once again
    Refreshed her shrunken eyes,
    Dropping like rain
    After long sultry drouth;
    Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,
    She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth
      Her lips began to scorch,
    That juice was wormwood to her tongue,
    She loathed the feast:
    Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,
    Rent all her robe, and wrung
    Her hands in lamentable haste,
    And beat her breast.
    Her locks streamed like the torch
    Borne by a racer at full speed,
    Or like the mane of horses in their flight,
    Or like an eagle when she stems the light
    Straight toward the sun,
    Or like a caged thing freed,
    Or like a flying flag when armies run
      Swift fire spread through her veins, knocked at her heart,
    Met the fire smouldering there
    And overbore its lesser flame;
    She gorged on bitterness without a name:
    Ah! fool, to choose such part
    Of soul-consuming care!
    Sense failed in the mortal strife:
    Like the watch-tower of a town
    Which an earthquake shatters down,
    Like a lightning-stricken mast,
    Like a wind-uprooted tree
    Spun about,
    Like a foam-topped water-spout
    Cast down headlong in the sea,
    She fell at last;
    Pleasure past and anguish past,
    Is it death or is it life
      Life out of death.
    That night long Lizzie watched by her,
    Counted her pulse's flagging stir,
    Felt for her breath,
    Held water to her lips, and cooled her face
    With tears and fanning leaves:
    But when the first birds chirped about their eaves,
    And early reapers plodded to the place
    Of golden sheaves,
    And dew-wet grass
    Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass,
    And new buds with new day
    Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream,
    Laura awoke as from a dream,
    Laughed in the innocent old way,
    Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
    Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of gray,
    Her breath was sweet as May,
    And light danced in her eyes
      Days, weeks, months, years
    Afterwards, when both were wives
    With children of their own;
    Their mother-hearts beset with fears,
    Their lives bound up in tender lives;
    Laura would call the little ones
    And tell them of her early prime,
    Those pleasant days long gone
    Of not-returning time:
    Would talk about the haunted glen,
    The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,
    Their fruits like honey to the throat,
    But poison in the blood;
    (Men sell not such in any town;)
    Would tell them how her sister stood
    In deadly peril to do her good,
    And win the fiery antidote:
    Then joining hands to little hands
    Would bid them cling together,
    "For there is no friend like a sister,
    In calm or stormy weather,
    To cheer one on the tedious way,
    To fetch one if one goes astray,
    To lift one if one totters down,
    To strengthen whilst one stands
    June
    A hundred, a thousand to one; even so;
      Not a hope in the world remained:
    The swarming, howling wretches below
      Gained and gained and gained
    Skene looked at his pale young wife:--
      "Is the time come?"--"The time is come!"--
    Young, strong, and so full of life:
      The agony struck them dumb
    Close his arm about her now,
      Close her cheek to his,
    Close the pistol to her brow--
      God forgive them this
    "Will it hurt much?"--"No, mine own:
      I wish I could bear the pang for both."
    "I wish I could bear the pang alone:
      Courage, dear, I am not loth
    Kiss and kiss: "It is not pain
      Thus to kiss and die.
    One kiss more."--"And yet one again."--
      "Good by."--"Good by
Note.--I retain this little poem, not as historically accurate, but as
written and published before I heard the supposed facts of its first
verse contradicted
    Where sunless rivers weep
    Their waves into the deep,
    She sleeps a charmèd sleep:
      Awake her not.
    Led by a single star,
    She came from very far
    To seek where shadows are
      Her pleasant lot
    She left the rosy morn,
    She left the fields of corn,
    For twilight cold and lorn
      And water springs.
    Through sleep, as through a veil,
    She sees the sky look pale,
    And hears the nightingale
      That sadly sings
    Rest, rest, a perfect rest
    Shed over brow and breast;
    Her face is toward the west,
      The purple land.
    She cannot see the grain
    Ripening on hill and plain;
    She cannot feel the rain
      Upon her hand
    Rest, rest, forevermore
    Upon a mossy shore;
    Rest, rest at the heart's core
      Till time shall cease:
    Sleep that no pain shall wake,
    Night that no morn shall break,
    Till joy shall overtake
      Her perfect peace
    When I was dead, my spirit turned
      To seek the much-frequented house
    I passed the door, and saw my friends
      Feasting beneath green orange-boughs;
    From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
      They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
    They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
      For each was loved of each
    I listened to their honest chat:
      Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
    Plod plod along the featureless sands,
      And coasting miles and miles of sea."
    Said one: "Before the turn of tide
      We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
    Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
      To-day, but much more sweet
    "To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
      And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
    "To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
      While no one spoke of yesterday.
    Their life stood full at blessed noon;
      I, only I, had passed away:
    "To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
      I was of yesterday
    I shivered comfortless, but cast
      No chill across the table-cloth;
    I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
      To stay, and yet to part how loth:
    I passed from the familiar room,
      I who from love had passed away,
    Like the remembrance of a guest
      That tarrieth but a day
    Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
      I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
      A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
    A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
    Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
      Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
      Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
    Athirst and hungering on a barren spot
    For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
      I live alone, I look to die alone:
    Yet sometimes when a wind sighs through the sedge,
      Ghosts of my buried years and friends come back,
    My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
      On sometime summer's unreturning track
    I had a love in soft south land,
      Beloved through April far in May;
    He waited on my lightest breath,
      And never dared to say me nay
    He saddened if my cheer was sad,
      But gay he grew if I was gay;
    We never differed on a hair,
      My yes his yes, my nay his nay
    The wedding hour was come, the aisles
      Were flushed with sun and flowers that day;
    I pacing balanced in my thoughts,--
      "It's quite too late to think of nay
    My bridegroom answered in his turn,
      Myself had almost answered "yea":
    When through the flashing nave I heard.
      A struggle and resounding "nay
    Bridemaids and bridegroom shrank in fear,
      But I stood high who stood at bay:
    "And if I answer yea, fair Sir,
      What man art thou to bar with nay
    He was a strong man from the north,
      Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous gray:
    "Put yea by for another time
      In which I will not say thee nay
    He took me in his strong white arms,
      He bore me on his horse away
    O'er crag, morass, and hair-breadth pass,
      But never asked me yea or nay
    He made me fast with book and bell,
      With links of love he makes me stay;
    Till now I've neither heart nor power
      Nor will nor wish to say him nay
    Every valley drinks,
      Every dell and hollow:
    Where the kind rain sinks and sinks,
      Green of Spring will follow
    Yet a lapse of weeks
      Buds will burst their edges,
    Strip their wool-coats, glue-coats, streaks,
      In the woods and hedges
    Weave a bower of love
      For birds to meet each other,
    Weave a canopy above
      Nest and egg and mother
    But for fattening rain
      We should have no flowers,
    Never a bud or leaf again
      But for soaking showers
    Never a mated bird
      In the rocking tree-tops,
    Never indeed a flock or herd
      To graze upon the lea-crops
    Lambs so woolly white,
      Sheep the sun-bright leas on,
    They could have no grass to bite
      But for rain in season
    We should find no moss
      In the shadiest places,
    Find no waving meadow-grass
      Pied with broad-eyed daisies
    But miles of barren sand,
      With never a son or daughter,
    Not a lily on the land,
      Or lily on the water
    Why were you born when the snow was falling?
    You should have come to the cuckoo's calling,
    Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
    Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
      For their far off flying
      From summer dying
    Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
    You should have died at the apples' dropping,
    When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
    And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
      And all winds go sighing
      For sweet things dying
    As rivers seek the sea,
      Much more deep than they,
    So my soul seeks thee
      Far away:
    As running rivers moan
    On their course alone
      So I moan
      Left alone
    As the delicate rose
      To the sun's sweet strength
    Doth herself unclose,
      Breadth and length:
    So spreads my heart to thee
    Unveiled utterly,
      I to thee
      Utterly
    As morning dew exhales
      Sunwards pure and free,
    So my spirit fails
      After thee:
    As dew leaves not a trace
    On the green earth's face;
      I, no trace
      On thy face
    Its goal the river knows,
      Dewdrops find a way,
    Sunlight cheers the rose
      In her day:
    Shall I, lone sorrow past,
    Find thee at the last?
      Sorrow past,
      Thee at last
    "Now did you mark a falcon,
      Sister dear, sister dear,
    Flying toward my window
      In the morning cool and clear?
    With jingling bells about her neck,
      But what beneath her wing?
    It may have been a ribbon,
      Or it may have been a ring."--
          "I marked a falcon swooping
            At the break of day:
          And for your love, my sister dove,
            I 'frayed the thief away
    "Or did you spy a ruddy hound,
      Sister fair and tall,
    Went snuffing round my garden bound,
      Or crouched by my bower wall?
    With a silken leash about his neck;
      But in his mouth may be
    A chain of gold and silver links,
      Or a letter writ to me."--
          "I heard a hound, high-born sister,
            Stood baying at the moon:
          I rose and drove him from your wall
            Lest you should wake too soon
    "Or did you meet a pretty page
      Sat swinging on the gate;
    Sat whistling, whistling like a bird,
      Or may be slept too late:
    With eaglets broidered on his cap,
      And eaglets on his glove?
    If you had turned his pockets out,
      You had found some pledge of love."--
          "I met him at this daybreak,
            Scarce the east was red:
          Lest the creaking gate should anger you,
            I packed him home to bed
    "O patience, sister. Did you see
      A young man tall and strong,
    Swift-footed to uphold the right
      And to uproot the wrong,
    Come home across the desolate sea
      To woo me for his wife?
    And in his heart my heart is locked,
      And in his life my life."--
          "I met a nameless man, sister,
            Who loitered round our door:
          I said: Her husband loves her much.
            And yet she loves him more
    "Fie, sister, fie, a wicked lie,
      A lie, a wicked lie;
    I have none other love but him,
      Nor will have till I die.
    And you have turned him from our door,
      And stabbed him with a lie:
    I will go seek him thro' the world
      In sorrow till I die."--
          "Go seek in sorrow, sister,
            And find in sorrow too:
          If thus you shame our father's name
            My curse go forth with you
    Frost-locked all the winter,
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    What shall make their sap ascend
    That they may put forth shoots?
    Tips of tender green,
    Leaf, or blade, or sheath;
    Telling of the hidden life
    That breaks forth underneath,
    Life nursed in its grave by Death
    Blows the thaw-wind pleasantly,
    Drips the soaking rain,
    By fits looks down the waking sun:
    Young grass springs on the plain;
    Young leaves clothe early hedgerow trees;
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    Swollen with sap, put forth their shoots;
    Curled-headed ferns sprout in the lane;
    Birds sing and pair again
    There is no time like Spring,
    When life's alive in everything,
    Before new nestlings sing,
    Before cleft swallows speed their journey back
    Along the trackless track,--
    God guides their wing,
    He spreads their table that they nothing lack,--
    Before the daisy grows a common flower,
    Before the sun has power
    To scorch the world up in his noontide hour
    There is no time like Spring,
    Like Spring that passes by;
    There is no life like Spring-life born to die,--
    Piercing the sod,
    Clothing the uncouth clod,
    Hatched in the nest,
    Fledged on the windy bough,
    Strong on the wing:
    There is no time like Spring that passes by,
    Now newly born, and now
    Hastening to die
    The upland flocks grew starved and thinned:
      Their shepherds scarce could feed the lambs
    Whose milkless mothers butted them,
      Or who were orphaned of their dams.
    The lambs athirst for mother's milk
      Filled all the place with piteous sounds:
    Their mothers' bones made white for miles
      The pastureless wet pasture grounds
    Day after day, night after night,
      From lamb to lamb the shepherds went,
    With teapots for the bleating mouths
      Instead of nature's nourishment.
    The little shivering gaping things
      Soon knew the step that brought them aid,
    And fondled the protecting hand,
      And rubbed it with a woolly head
    Then, as the days waxed on to weeks,
      It was a pretty sight to see
    These lambs with frisky heads and tails
      Skipping and leaping on the lea,
    Bleating in tender, trustful tones,
      Resting on rocky crag or mound,
    And following the beloved feet
      That once had sought for them and found
    These very shepherds of their flocks,
      These loving lambs so meek to please,
    Are worthy of recording words
      And honor in their due degrees:
    So I might live a hundred years,
      And roam from strand to foreign strand,
    Yet not forget this flooded spring
      And scarce-saved lambs of Westmoreland
    My heart is like a singing bird
      Whose nest is in a watered shoot;
    My heart is like an apple-tree
      Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit;
    My heart is like a rainbow shell
      That paddles in a halcyon sea;
    My heart is gladder than all these
      Because my love is come to me
    Raise me a dais of silk and down;
      Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
    Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
      And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
    Work it in gold and silver grapes,
      In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
    Because the birthday of my life
      Is come, my love is come to me
    Remember me when I am gone away,
      Gone far away into the silent land;
      When you can no more hold me by the hand,
    Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
    Remember me when no more, day by day,
      You tell me of our future that you planned:
      Only remember me; you understand
    It will be late to counsel then or pray.
    Yet if you should forget me for a while
      And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
      For if the darkness and corruption leave
      A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
    Better by far you should forget and smile
      Than that you should remember and be sad
    The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
      And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
      Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
    Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
    He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
      And could not hear him; but I heard him say:
      "Poor child, poor child": and as he turned away
    Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
    He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
      That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
        Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
        He did not love me living; but once dead
      He pitied me; and very sweet it is
    To know he still is warm though I am cold
    Love, strong as Death, is dead.
    Come, let us make his bed
    Among the dying flowers:
    A green turf at his head;
    And a stone at his feet,
    Whereon we may sit
    In the quiet evening hours
    He was born in the Spring,
    And died before the harvesting:
    On the last warm summer day
    He left us; he would not stay
    For autumn twilight, cold and gray.
    Sit we by his grave, and sing
    He is gone away
    To few chords and sad and low
    Sing we so:
    Be our eyes fixed on the grass
    Shadow-veiled as the years pass,
    While we think of all that was
    In the long ago
    Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night,
    Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth
      I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
    Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
    It waxed and colored sensibly to sight,
    Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
    Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,
    Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
    The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend,
    My closest friend, would deem the facts untrue;
    And therefore it were wisely left untold;
    Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end
      Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
    And polished stones, that with their wearers grew:
    But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,
    Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,
    Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
    All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,
    But special burnishment adorned his mail,
    And special terror weighed upon his frown;
    His punier brethren quaked before his tail,
    Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail.
    So he grew lord and master of his kin:
    But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
    An execrable appetite arose,
    He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in.
    He knew no law, he feared no binding law,
    But ground them with inexorable jaw:
    The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,
    Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,
    While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
    Till every minor crocodile being dead
    And buried too, himself gorged to the full,
    He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
    O marvel passing strange which next I saw:
    In sleep he dwindled to the common size,
    And all the empire faded from his coat.
    Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,
    Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:
    I know not what it bore of freight or host,
    But white it was as an avenging ghost.
    It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
    Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
    It seemed to tame the waters without force
    Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
    Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,
    The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
    And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands
      What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
    For meaning, but myself must echo, What?
    And tell it as I saw it on the spot
    O roses for the flush of youth,
      And laurel for the perfect prime;
    But pluck an ivy branch for me
      Grown old before my time
    O violets for the grave of youth,
      And bay for those dead in their prime;
    Give me the withered leaves I chose
      Before in the old time
    O love, love, hold me fast,--
    He draws me away from thee;
    I cannot stem the blast,
    Nor the cold strong sea:
    Far away a light shines
    Beyond the hills and pines;
    It is lit for me
    I have thee close, my dear,
    No terror can come near;
    Only far off the northern light shines clear
    Come with me, fair and false,
    To our home, come home.
    It is my voice that calls:
    Once thou wast not afraid
    When I wooed, and said,
    "Come, our nest is newly made,"--
    Now cross the tossing foam
    Hold me one moment longer,
    He taunts me with the past,
    His clutch is waxing stronger,
    Hold me fast, hold me fast.
    He draws me from thy heart,
    And I cannot withhold:
    He bids my spirit depart
    With him into the cold:--
    O bitter vows of old
    Lean on me, hide thine eyes:
    Only ourselves, earth and skies,
    Are present here: be wise
    Lean on me, come away,
    I will guide and steady:
    Come, for I will not stay:
    Come, for house and bed are ready.
    Ah, sure bed and house,
    For better and worse, for life and death:
    Goal won with shortened breath:
    Come, crown our vows
    One moment, one more word,
    While my heart beats still,
    While my breath is stirred
    By my fainting will.
    O friend forsake me not,
    Forget not as I forgot:
    But keep thy heart for me,
    Keep thy faith true and bright;
    Through the lone cold winter night
    Perhaps I may come to thee
    Nay, peace, my darling, peace:
    Let these dreams and terrors cease:
    Who spoke of death or change or aught but ease
    O fair frail sin,
    O poor harvest gathered in!
    Thou shalt visit him again
    To watch his heart grow cold;
    To know the gnawing pain
    I knew of old;
    To see one much more fair
    Fill up the vacant chair,
    Fill his heart, his children bear:--
    While thou and I together
    In the outcast weather
    Toss and howl and spin
    Live all thy sweet life through
      Sweet Rose, dew-sprent,
    Drop down thine evening dew
    To gather it anew
    When day is bright:
      I fancy thou wast meant
    Chiefly to give delight
    Sing in the silent sky,
      Glad soaring bird;
    Sing out thy notes on high
    To sunbeam straying by
    Or passing cloud;
      Heedless if thou art heard
    Sing thy full song aloud
    O that it were with me
      As with the flower;
    Blooming on its own tree
    For butterfly and bee
    Its summer morns:
      That I might bloom mine hour
    A rose in spite of thorns
    O that my work were done
      As birds' that soar
    Rejoicing in the sun:
    That when my time is run
    And daylight too,
      I so might rest once more
    Cool with refreshing dew
    I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree,
      And wore them all that evening in my hair:
    Then in due season when I went to see
      I found no apples there
    With dangling basket all along the grass
      As I had come I went the selfsame track:
    My neighbors mocked me while they saw me pass
      So empty-handed back
    Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by,
      Their heaped-up basket teased me like a jeer;
    Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,
      Their mother's home was near
    Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,
      A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
    A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
      More sweet to me than song
    Ah, Willie, Willie, was my love less worth
      Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
    I counted rosiest apples on the earth
      Of far less worth than love
    So once it was with me you stooped to talk
      Laughing and listening in this very lane:
    To think that by this way we used to walk
      We shall not walk again
    I let my neighbors pass me, ones and twos
      And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,
    And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews
      Fell fast I loitered still
    Two doves upon the selfsame branch,
      Two lilies on a single stem,
    Two butterflies upon one flower:--
      O happy they who look on them
    Who look upon them hand in hand
      Flushed in the rosy summer light;
    Who look upon them hand in hand
      And never give a thought to night
    Out of the church she followed them
      With a lofty step and mien:
    His bride was like a village maid,
      Maude Clare was like a queen
    "Son Thomas," his lady mother said,
      With smiles, almost with tears:
    "May Nell and you but live as true
      As we have done for years
    "Your father thirty years ago
      Had just your tale to tell;
    But he was not so pale as you,
      Nor I so pale as Nell
    My lord was pale with inward strife,
      And Nell was pale with pride;
    My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare
      Or ever he kissed the bride
    "Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord,
      Have brought my gift," she said:
    "To bless the hearth, to bless the board,
      To bless the marriage-bed
    "Here's my half of the golden chain
      You wore about your neck,
    That day we waded ankle-deep
      For lilies in the beck
    "Here's my half of the faded leaves
      We plucked from budding bough,
    With feet amongst the lily-leaves,--
      The lilies are budding now
    He strove to match her scorn with scorn,
      He faltered in his place:
    "Lady," he said,--"Maude Clare," he said,--
      "Maude Clare":--and hid his face
    She turned to Nell: "My Lady Nell,
      I have a gift for you;
    Though, were it fruit, the bloom were gone,
      Or, were it flowers, the dew
    "Take my share of a fickle heart,
      Mine of a paltry love:
    Take it or leave it as you will,
      I wash my hands thereof
    "And what you leave," said Nell, "I'll take,
      And what you spurn, I'll wear;
    For he's my lord for better and worse,
      And him I love, Maude Clare
    "Yea, though you're taller by the head,
      More wise, and much more fair;
    I'll love him till he loves me best,
      Me best of all, Maude Clare
    Come to me in the silence of the night;
      Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
    Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
      As sunlight on a stream;
        Come back in tears,
    O memory, hope, love of finished years
    O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
      Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
    Where souls brimful of love abide and meet;
      Where thirsting longing eyes
        Watch the slow door
    That opening, letting in, lets out no more
    Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
      My very life again though cold in death:
    Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
      Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
        Speak low, lean low,
    As long ago, my love, how long ago
      I tell my secret? No indeed, not I:
    Perhaps some day, who knows?
    But not to-day; it froze, and blows, and snows,
    And you're too curious: fie!
    You want to hear it? well:
    Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell
      Or, after all, perhaps there's none:
    Suppose there is no secret after all,
    But only just my fun.
    To-day's a nipping day, a biting day;
    In which one wants a shawl,
    A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
    I cannot ope to every one who taps,
    And let the draughts come whistling through my hall;
    Come bounding and surrounding me,
    Come buffeting, astounding me,
    Nipping and clipping through my wraps and all.
    I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
    His nose to Russian snows
    To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
    You would not peck? I thank you for good-will,
    Believe, but leave that truth untested still
      Spring's an expansive time: yet I don't trust
    March with its peck of dust,
    Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
    Nor even May, whose flowers
    One frost may wither through the sunless hours
      Perhaps some languid summer day,
    When drowsy birds sing less and less,
    And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
    If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,
    And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
    Perhaps my secret I may say,
    Or you may guess
    If I might see another Spring
      I'd not plant summer flowers and wait:
    I'd have my crocuses at once,
    My leafless pink mezereons,
      My chill-veined snowdrops, choicer yet
      My white or azure violet,
    Leaf-nested primrose; anything
      To blow at once not late
    If I might see another Spring
      I'd listen to the daylight birds
    That build their nests and pair and sing,
    Nor wait for mateless nightingale;
      I'd listen to the lusty herds,
      The ewes with lambs as white as snow,
    I'd find out music in the hail
      And all the winds that blow
    If I might see another Spring--
      O stinging comment on my past
    That all my past results in "if"--
      If I might see another Spring
    I'd laugh to-day, to-day is brief;
      I would not wait for anything:
      I'd use to-day that cannot last,
      Be glad to-day and sing
    Strike the bells wantonly,
      Tinkle tinkle well;
    Bring me wine, bring me flowers,
      Ring the silver bell.
    All my lamps burn scented oil,
      Hung on laden orange-trees,
    Whose shadowed foliage is the foil
      To golden lamps and oranges.
    Heap my golden plates with fruit,
      Golden fruit, fresh-plucked and ripe;
      Strike the bells and breathe the pipe;
    Shut out showers from summer hours;
    Silence that complaining lute;
      Shut out thinking, shut out pain,
      From hours that cannot come again
    Strike the bells solemnly,
      Ding dong deep:
    My friend is passing to his bed,
      Fast asleep;
    There's plaited linen round his head,
      While foremost go his feet,--
    His feet that cannot carry him.
    My feast's a show, my lights are dim;
      Be still, your music is not sweet,--
    There is no music more for him:
      His lights are out, his feast is done;
    His bowl that sparkled to the brim
    Is drained, is broken, cannot hold;
    My blood is chill, his blood is cold;
      His death is full, and mine begun
    A blue-eyed phantom far before
      Is laughing, leaping toward the sun;
    Like lead I chase it evermore,
      I pant and run
    It breaks the sunlight bound on bound;
      Goes singing as it leaps along
    To sheep-bells with a dreamy sound
      A dreamy song
    I laugh, it is so brisk and gay;
      It is so far before, I weep:
    I hope I shall lie down some day,
      Lie down and sleep
    I never said I loved you, John:
      Why will you tease me, day by day,
    And wax a weariness to think upon
      With always "do" and "pray
    You know I never loved you, John;
      No fault of mine made me your toast:
    Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
      As shows an hour-old ghost
    I dare say Meg or Moll would take
      Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
    And pray don't remain single for my sake
      Who can't perform that task
    I have no heart?--Perhaps I have not;
      But then you're mad to take offence
    That I don't give you what I have not got:
      Use your own common sense
    Let bygones be bygones:
      Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
    I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
      Than answer "Yes" to you
    Let's mar our pleasant days no more,
      Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
    Catch at to-day, forget the days before:
      I'll wink at your untruth
    Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
      No more, no less: and friendship's good:
    Only don't keep in view ulterior ends,
      And points not understood
    Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
    Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,--
      No, thank you, John
      I cannot tell you how it was;
    But this I know: it came to pass
    Upon a bright and breezy day
    When May was young; ah, pleasant May!
    As yet the poppies were not born
    Between the blades of tender corn;
    The last eggs had not hatched as yet,
    Nor any bird foregone its mate
      I cannot tell you what it was;
    But this I know: it did but pass.
    It passed away with sunny May,
    With all sweet things it passed away,
    And left me old, and cold, and gray
    I looked for that which is not, nor can be,
      And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth
      But years must pass before a hope of youth
        Is resigned utterly
    I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
      And though the object seemed to flee away
      That I so longed for, ever day by day
        I watched and waited still
    Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
      My expectation wearies and shall cease;
      I will resign it now and be at peace:
        Yet never gave it o'er
    Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
      I long for; to a name why should I give
      The peace of all the days I have to live?--
        Yet gave it all the same
    Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit
      For healthy joy and salutary pain:
      Thou knowest the chase useless, and again
        Turnest to follow it
        O pleasant eventide!
        Clouds on the western side
    Grow gray and grayer, hiding the warm sun:
    The bees and birds, their happy labors done,
        Seek their close nests and bide
        Screened in the leafy wood
        The stock-doves sit and brood:
    The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough
    But lazily; pauses; and settles now
        Where once he stored his food
        One by one the flowers close,
        Lily and dewy rose
    Shutting their tender petals from the moon:
    The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon
        Are still the noisy crows
        The dormouse squats and eats
        Choice little dainty bits
    Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime;
    Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time
        And listens where he sits
        From far the lowings come
        Of cattle driven home:
    From farther still the wind brings fitfully
    The vast continual murmur of the sea,
        Now loud, now almost dumb
        The gnats whirl in the air,
        The evening gnats; and there
    The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail
    For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail
        Comes forth, clammy and bare
        Hark! that's the nightingale,
        Telling the self-same tale
    Her song told when this ancient earth was young:
    So echoes answered when her song was sung
        In the first wooded vale
        We call it love and pain
        The passion of her strain;
    And yet we little understand or know:
    Why should it not be rather joy that so
        Throbs in each throbbing vein
        In separate herds the deer
        Lie; here the bucks, and here
    The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn:
    Through all the hours of night until the dawn
        They sleep, forgetting fear
        The hare sleeps where it lies,
        With wary half-closed eyes;
    The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:
    Only the fox is out, some heedless duck
        Or chicken to surprise
        Remote, each single star
        Comes out, till there they are
    All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp!
    While close at hand the glow-worm lights her lamp
        Or twinkles from afar
        But evening now is done
        As much as if the sun
    Day-giving had arisen in the east:
    For night has come; and the great calm has ceased,
        The quiet sands have run
    Pardon the faults in me,
      For the love of years ago:
        Good by.
    I must drift across the sea,
      I must sink into the snow,
        I must die
    You can bask in this sun,
      You can drink wine, and eat:
        Good by.
    I must gird myself and run,
      Though with unready feet:
        I must die
    Blank sea to sail upon,
      Cold bed to sleep in:
        Good by.
    While you clasp, I must be gone
      For all your weeping:
        I must die
    A kiss for one friend,
      And a word for two,--
        Good by:--
    A lock that you must send,
      A kindness you must do:
        I must die
    Not a word for you,
      Not a lock or kiss,
        Good by.
    We, one, must part in two:
      Verily death is this:
        I must die
      "A cup for hope!" she said,
    In springtime ere the bloom was old:
    The crimson wine was poor and cold
      By her mouth's richer red
      "A cup for love!" how low,
    How soft the words; and all the while
    Her blush was rippling with a smile
      Like summer after snow
      "A cup for memory!"
    Cold cup that one must drain alone:
    While autumn winds are up and moan
      Across the barren sea
      Hope, memory, love:
    Hope for fair morn, and love for day,
    And memory for the evening gray
      And solitary dove
    The hope I dreamed of was a dream,
      Was but a dream; and now I wake
    Exceeding comfortless, and worn, and old,
      For a dream's sake
    I hang my harp upon a tree,
      A weeping willow in a lake;
    I hang my silenced harp there, wrung and snapt
      For a dream's sake
    Lie still, lie still, my breaking heart;
      My silent heart, lie still and break:
    Life, and the world, and mine own self, are changed
      For a dream's sake
    The door was shut. I looked between
      Its iron bars; and saw it lie,
      My garden, mine, beneath the sky,
    Pied with all flowers bedewed and green
    From bough to bough the song-birds crossed,
      From flower to flower the moths and bees;
      With all its nests and stately trees
    It had been mine, and it was lost
    A shadowless spirit kept the gate,
      Blank and unchanging like the grave.
      I peering through said: "Let me have
    Some buds to cheer my outcast state
    He answered not. "Or give me, then,
      But one small twig from shrub or tree;
      And bid my home remember me
    Until I come to it again
    The spirit was silent; but he took
      Mortar and stone to build a wall;
      He left no loophole great or small
    Through which my straining eyes might look
    So now I sit here quite alone
      Blinded with tears; nor grieve for that,
      For naught is left worth looking at
    Since my delightful land is gone
    A violet bed is budding near,
      Wherein a lark has made her nest:
      And good they are, but not the best;
    And dear they are, but not so dear
    Some are laughing, some are weeping;
    She is sleeping, only sleeping.
    Round her rest wild flowers are creeping;
    There the wind is heaping, heaping
    Sweetest sweets of Summer's keeping,
    By the cornfields ripe for reaping
    There are lilies, and there blushes
    The deep rose, and there the thrushes
    Sing till latest sunlight flushes
    In the west; a fresh wind brushes
    Through the leaves while evening hushes
    There by day the lark is singing
    And the grass and weeds are springing:
    There by night the bat is winging;
    There forever winds are bringing
    Far-off chimes of church-bells ringing
    Night and morning, noon and even,
    Their sound fills her dreams with Heaven:
    The long strife at length is striven:
    Till her grave-bands shall be riven
    Such is the good portion given
    To her soul at rest and shriven
    She sat and sang alway
      By the green margin of a stream,
    Watching the fishes leap and play
      Beneath the glad sunbeam
    I sat and wept alway
      Beneath the moon's most shadowy beam,
    Watching the blossoms of the May
      Weep leaves into the stream
    I wept for memory;
      She sang for hope that is so fair:
    My tears were swallowed by the sea;
      Her songs died on the air
    When I am dead, my dearest,
      Sing no sad songs for me;
    Plant thou no roses at my head,
      Nor shady cypress-tree:
    Be the green grass above me
      With showers and dewdrops wet;
    And if thou wilt, remember,
      And if thou wilt, forget
    I shall not see the shadows,
      I shall not feel the rain;
    I shall not hear the nightingale
      Sing on, as if in pain:
    And dreaming through the twilight
      That doth not rise nor set,
    Haply I may remember,
      And haply may forget
    Ah! changed and cold, how changed and very cold!
      With stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes:
      Changed, yet the same; much knowing, little wise;
    _This_ was the promise of the days of old!
    Grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould,
      Grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies:
      We hoped for better things as years would rise,
    But it is over as a tale once told.
    All fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore,
      All lost the present and the future time,
    All lost, all lost, the lapse that went before:
    So lost till death shut-to the opened door,
      So lost from chime to everlasting chime,
    So cold and lost forever evermore
    Summer is gone with all its roses,
      Its sun and perfumes and sweet flowers,
      Its warm air and refreshing showers:
        And even Autumn closes
    Yea, Autumn's chilly self is going,
      And winter comes which is yet colder;
      Each day the hoar-frost waxes bolder
        And the last buds cease blowing
    Who calleth?--Thy Father calleth,
      Run, O Daughter, to wait on Him:
    He Who chasteneth but for a season
      Trims thy lamp that it burn not dim
    Who calleth?--Thy Master calleth,
      Sit, Disciple, and learn of Him:
    He Who teacheth wisdom of Angels
      Makes thee wise as the Cherubim
    Who calleth?--Thy Monarch calleth,
      Rise, O Subject, and follow Him:
    He is stronger than Death or Devil,
      Fear not thou if the foe be grim
    Who calleth?--Thy Lord God calleth.
      Fall, O Creature, adoring Him:
    He is jealous, thy God Almighty,
      Count not dear to thee life or limb
    Who calleth?--Thy Bridegroom calleth,
      Soar, O Bride, with the Seraphim:
    He Who loves thee as no man loveth,
      Bids thee give up thy heart to Him
    O Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes;
      Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth;
      Lie close around her; leave no room for mirth
    With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs.
    She hath no questions, she hath no replies,
      Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth
      Of all that irked her from the hour of birth;
    With stillness that is almost Paradise.
    Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her,
      Silence more musical than any song;
    Even her very heart has ceased to stir:
    Until the morning of Eternity
    Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be;
      And when she wakes she will not think it long
    I wonder if the sap is stirring yet,
    If wintry birds are dreaming of a mate,
    If frozen snowdrops feel as yet the sun
    And crocus fires are kindling one by one:
      Sing, robin, sing!
    I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring
    I wonder if the spring-tide of this year
    Will bring another Spring both lost and dear;
    If heart and spirit will find out their Spring,
    Or if the world alone will bud and sing:
      Sing, hope, to me!
    Sweet notes, my hope, soft notes for memory
    The sap will surely quicken soon or late,
    The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate;
    So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom,
    Or in this world, or in the world to come:
      Sing, voice of Spring!
    Till I too blossom and rejoice and sing
    There's blood between us, love, my love,
    There's father's blood, there's brother's blood;
    And blood's a bar I cannot pass:
    I choose the stairs that mount above,
    Stair after golden skyward stair,
    To city and to sea of glass.
    My lily feet are soiled with mud,
    With scarlet mud which tells a tale
    Of hope that was, of guilt that was,
    Of love that shall not yet avail;
    Alas, my heart, if I could bare
    My heart, this self-same stain is there:
    I seek the sea of glass and fire
    To wash the spot, to burn the snare;
    Lo, stairs are meant to lift us higher:
    Mount with me, mount the kindled stair
      Your eyes look earthward, mine look up.
    I see the far-off city grand,
    Beyond the hills a watered land,
    Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand
    Of mansions where the righteous sup;
    Who sleep at ease among their trees,
    Or wake to sing a cadenced hymn
    With Cherubim and Seraphim;
    They bore the Cross, they drained the cup,
    Racked, roasted, crushed, wrenched limb from limb,
    They the offscouring of the world:
    The heaven of starry heavens unfurled,
    The sun before their face is dim
    You looking earthward, what see you?
    Milk-white, wine-flushed among the vines,
    Up and down leaping, to and fro,
    Most glad, most full, made strong with wines,
    Blooming as peaches pearled with dew,
    Their golden windy hair afloat,
    Love-music warbling in their throat,
    Young men and women come and go
      You linger, yet the time is short:
    Flee for your life, gird up your strength
    To flee: the shadows stretched at length
    Show that day wanes, that night draws nigh;
    Flee to the mountain, tarry not.
    Is this a time for smile and sigh,
    For songs among the secret trees
    Where sudden bluebirds nest and sport?
    The time is short and yet you stay:
    To-day, while it is called to-day,
    Kneel, wrestle, knock, do violence, pray;
    To-day is short, to-morrow nigh:
    Why will you die? why will you die
      You sinned with me a pleasant sin:
    Repent with me, for I repent.
    Woe's me the lore I must unlearn!
    Woe's me that easy way we went,
    So rugged when I would return!
    How long until my sleep begin,
    How long shall stretch these nights and days?
    Surely, clean Angels cry, she prays;
    She laves her soul with tedious tears:
    How long must stretch these years and years
      I turn from you my cheeks and eyes,
    My hair which you shall see no more,--
    Alas for joy that went before,
    For joy that dies, for love that dies.
    Only my lips still turn to you,
    My livid lips that cry, Repent!
    O weary life, O weary Lent,
    O weary time whose stars are few
      How should I rest in Paradise,
    Or sit on steps of Heaven alone?
    If Saints and Angels spoke of love
    Should I not answer from my throne?
    Have pity upon me, ye my friends,
    For I have heard the sound thereof:
    Should I not turn with yearning eyes,
    Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang?
    O save me from a pang in Heaven!
    By all the gifts we took and gave,
    Repent, repent, and be forgiven:
    This life is long, but yet it ends;
    Repent and purge your soul and save:
    No gladder song the morning stars
    Upon their birthday morning sang
    Than Angels sing when one repents
      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    A spirit with transfigured face
    Fire-footed clomb an infinite space.
    I heard his hundred pinions clang,
    Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang,
    Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents,
    Worlds spun upon their rushing cars:
    He mounted shrieking: "Give me light!"
    Still light was poured on him, more light;
    Angels, Archangels he outstripped,
    Exultant in exceeding might,
    And trod the skirts of Cherubim.
    Still "Give me light," he shrieked; and dipped
  Athirst with thirst it could not slake.
    I saw him, drunk with knowledge, take
    From aching brows the aureole crown,--
    His locks writhed like a cloven snake,--
    He left his throne to grovel down
    And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet:
    For what is knowledge duly weighed?
    Knowledge is strong, but love is sweet;
    Yea, all the progress he had made
    Was but to learn that all is small
    Save love, for love is all in all
      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    It was not dark, it was not light,
    Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair
    Through clay; you came to seek me there.
    And "Do you dream of me?" you said.
    My heart was dust that used to leap
    To you; I answered half asleep:
    "My pillow is damp, my sheets are red,
    There's a leaden tester to my bed:
    Find you a warmer playfellow,
    A warmer pillow for your head,
    A kinder love to love than mine."
    You wrung your hands; while I like lead
    Crushed downwards through the sodden earth:
    You smote your hands but not in mirth,
    And reeled but were not drunk with wine
      For all night long I dreamed of you:
    I woke and prayed against my will,
    Then slept to dream of you again.
    At length I rose and knelt and prayed:
    I cannot write the words I said,
    My words were slow, my tears were few;
    But through the dark my silence spoke
    Like thunder. When this morning broke,
    My face was pinched, my hair was gray,
    And frozen blood was on the sill
    Where stifling in my struggle I lay
      If now you saw me you would say:
    Where is the face I used to love?
    And I would answer: Gone before;
    It tarries veiled in Paradise.
    When once the morning star shall rise,
    When earth with shadow flees away
    And we stand safe within the door,
    Then you shall lift the veil thereof.
    Look up, rise up: for far above
    Our palms are grown, our place is set;
    There we shall meet as once we met,
    And love with old familiar love
    Does the road wind up-hill all the way?
      Yes, to the very end.
    Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
      From morn to night, my friend
    But is there for the night a resting-place?
      A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.
    May not the darkness hide it from my face?
      You cannot miss that inn
    Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
      Those who have gone before.
    Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
      They will not keep you standing at that door
    Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
      Of labor you shall find the sum.
    Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
      Yea, beds for all who come
    I bore with thee long weary days and nights,
      Through many pangs of heart, through many tears;
    I bore with thee, thy hardness, coldness, slights,
      For three and thirty years
    Who else had dared for thee what I have dared?
      I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above;
    I not My flesh, I not My spirit spared:
      Give thou Me love for love
    For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth,
      For thee I trembled in the nightly frost:
    Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth:
      Why wilt thou still be lost
    I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced:
      Men only marked upon My shoulders borne
    The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced,
      Or wagged their heads in scorn
    Thee did nails grave upon My hands, thy name
      Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes:
    I, Holy One, put on thy guilt and shame;
      I, God, Priest, Sacrifice
    A thief upon My right hand and My left;
      Six hours alone, athirst, in misery:
    At length in death one smote My heart and cleft
      A hiding-place for thee
    Nailed to the racking cross, than bed of down
      More dear, whereon to stretch Myself and sleep:
    So did I win a kingdom,--share My crown;
      A harvest,--come and reap
    I will accept thy will to do and be,
      Thy hatred and intolerance of sin,
    Thy will at least to love, that burns within
      And thirsteth after Me:
    So will I render fruitful, blessing still
      The germs and small beginnings in thy heart,
      Because thy will cleaves to the better part.--
        Alas, I cannot will
    Dost not thou will, poor soul? Yet I receive
      The inner unseen longings of the soul;
      I guide them turning towards Me; I control
        And charm hearts till they grieve:
    If thou desire, it yet shall come to pass,
      Though thou but wish indeed to choose My love;
      For I have power in earth and heaven above.--
        I cannot wish, alas
    What, neither choose nor wish to choose? and yet
      I still must strive to win thee and constrain:
      For thee I hung upon the cross in pain,
        How then can I forget?
    If thou as yet dost neither love, nor hate,
      Nor choose, nor wish,--resign thyself, be still
      Till I infuse love, hatred, longing, will.--
        I do not deprecate
    I have no wit, no words, no tears;
      My heart within me like a stone
    Is numbed too much for hopes or fears;
      Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
    I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
      No everlasting hills I see;
    My life is in the falling leaf:
        O Jesus, quicken me
    My life is like a faded leaf,
      My harvest dwindled to a husk;
    Truly my life is void and brief
      And tedious in the barren dusk;
    My life is like a frozen thing,
      No bud nor greenness can I see:
    Yet rise it shall,--the sap of Spring;
        O Jesus, rise in me
    My life is like a broken bowl,
      A broken bowl that cannot hold
    One drop of water for my soul
      Or cordial in the searching cold;
    Cast in the fire the perished thing,
      Melt and remould it, till it be
    A royal cup for Him my King:
        O Jesus, drink of me
    This Advent moon shines cold and clear,
      These Advent nights are long;
    Our lamps have burned year after year,
      And still their flame is strong.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" we cry,
      Heart-sick with hope deferred:
    "No speaking signs are in the sky,"
      Is still the watchman's word
    The Porter watches at the gate,
      The servants watch within;
    The watch is long betimes and late,
      The prize is slow to win.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" but still
      His answer sounds the same:
    "No daybreak tops the utmost hill,
      Nor pale our lamps of flame
    One to another hear them speak,
      The patient virgins wise:
    "Surely He is not far to seek,"--
      "All night we watch and rise."
    "The days are evil looking back,
      The coming days are dim;
    Yet count we not His promise slack,
      But watch and wait for Him
    One with another, soul with soul,
      They kindle fire from fire:
    "Friends watch us who have touched the goal."
      "They urge us, come up higher."
    "With them shall rest our waysore feet,
      With them is built our home,
    With Christ." "They sweet, but He most sweet,
      Sweeter than honeycomb
    There no more parting, no more pain,
      The distant ones brought near,
    The lost so long are found again,
      Long lost but longer dear:
    Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,
      Nor heart conceived that rest,
    With them our good things long deferred,
      With Jesus Christ our Best
    We weep because the night is long,
      We laugh, for day shall rise,
    We sing a slow contented song
      And knock at Paradise.
    Weeping we hold Him fast Who wept
      For us,--we hold Him fast;
    And will not let Him go except
      He bless us first or last
    Weeping we hold Him fast to-night;
      We will not let Him go
    Till daybreak smite our wearied sight,
      And summer smite the snow:
    Then figs shall bud, and dove with dove
      Shall coo the livelong day;
    Then He shall say, "Arise, My love,
      My fair one, come away
    "Sweet, thou art pale."
                "More pale to see,
    Christ hung upon the cruel tree
    And bore His Father's wrath for me
    "Sweet, thou art sad."
                "Beneath a rod
    More heavy, Christ for my sake trod
    The winepress of the wrath of God
    "Sweet, thou art weary."
                "Not so Christ:
    Whose mighty love of me sufficed
    For Strength, Salvation, Eucharist
    "Sweet, thou art footsore."
                "If I bleed,
    His feet have bled: yea, in my need
    His Heart once bled for mine indeed
    "Sweet, thou art young."
                "So He was young
    Who for my sake in silence hung
    Upon the Cross with Passion wrung
    "Look, thou art fair."
                "He was more fair
    Than men, Who deigned for me to wear
    A visage marred beyond compare
    "And thou hast riches."
                "Daily bread:
    All else is His; Who living, dead,
    For me lacked where to lay His Head
    "And life is sweet."
                "It was not so
    To Him, Whose Cup did overflow
    With mine unutterable woe
    "Thou drinkest deep."
                "When Christ would sup
    He drained the dregs from out my cup:
    So how should I be lifted up
    "Thou shalt win Glory."
                "In the skies,
    Lord Jesus, cover up mine eyes
    Lest they should look on vanities
    "Thou shalt have Knowledge."
                "Helpless dust,
    In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust:
    Answer Thou for me, Wise and Just
    "And Might."
                "Get thee behind me. Lord,
    Who hast redeemed and not abhorred
    My soul, O keep it by Thy Word
    Vanity of vanities, the Preacher saith,
      All things are vanity. The eye and ear
      Cannot be filled with what they see and hear.
    Like early dew, or like the sudden breath
    Of wind, or like the grass that withereth,
      Is man, tossed to and fro by hope and fear:
      So little joy hath he, so little cheer,
    Till all things end in the long dust of death.
    To-day is still the same as yesterday,
      To-morrow also even as one of them;
    And there is nothing new under the sun:
    Until the ancient race of Time be run,
      The old thorns shall grow out of the old stem,
    And morning shall be cold, and twilight gray
    "O happy happy land!
    Angels like rushes stand
      About the wells of light."--
      "Alas, I have not eyes for this fair sight:
    Hold fast my hand
    "As in a soft wind, they
    Bend all one blessed way,
      Each bowed in his own glory, star with star."--
      "I cannot see so far,
      Here shadows are
    "White-winged the cherubim,
    Yet whiter seraphim,
      Glow white with intense fire of love."--
    "Mine eyes are dim:
      I look in vain above,
    And miss their hymn
    "Angels, Archangels cry
    One to other ceaselessly
      (I hear them sing)
      One 'Holy, Holy, Holy,' to their King."--
    "I do not hear them
    "Joy to thee, Paradise,--
      Garden and goal and nest!
    Made green for wearied eyes;
      Much softer than the breast
    Of mother-dove clad in a rainbow's dyes
    "All precious souls are there
      Most safe, elect by grace,
      All tears are wiped forever from their face:
    Untired in prayer
      They wait and praise,
      Hidden for a little space
    "Boughs of the Living Vine,
    They spread in summer shine
      Green leaf with leaf:
    Sap of the Royal Vine, it stirs like wine
      In all both less and chief
    "Sing to the Lord,
      All spirits of all flesh, sing;
    For He hath not abhorred
      Our low estate nor scorned our offering:
      Shout to our King
    "But Zion said:
      My Lord forgetteth me.
    Lo, she hath made her bed
      In dust; forsaken weepeth she
      Where alien rivers swell the sea
    "She laid her body as the ground,
      Her tender body as the ground to those
    Who passed; her harpstrings cannot sound
    In a strange land; discrowned
      She sits, and drunk with woes
    "O drunken not with wine,
      Whose sins and sorrows have fulfilled the sum,--
      Be not afraid, arise, be no more dumb;
    Arise, shine,
      For thy light is come
    "Can these bones live?"--
                "God knows:
      The prophet saw such clothed with flesh and skin
      A wind blew on them and life entered in;
    They shook and rose.
      Hasten the time, O Lord, blot out their sin,
      Let life begin
    The sweetest blossoms die.
      And so it was that, going day by day
      Unto the church to praise and pray,
    And crossing the green churchyard thoughtfully,
      I saw how on the graves the flowers
      Shed their fresh leaves in showers,
    And how their perfume rose up to the sky
      Before it passed away
    The youngest blossoms die.
      They die and fall and nourish the rich earth
      From which they lately had their birth;
    Sweet life, but sweeter death that passeth by
      And is as though it had not been:--
      All colors turn to green;
    The bright hues vanish and the odors fly,
      The grass hath lasting worth
    And youth and beauty die.
      So be it, O my God, Thou God of truth:
      Better than beauty and than youth
    Are Saints and Angels, a glad company;
      And Thou, O Lord, our Rest and Ease,
      Art better far than these.
    Why should we shrink from our full harvest? why
      Prefer to glean with Ruth
    I watched a rosebud very long
      Brought on by dew and sun and shower,
      Waiting to see the perfect flower:
    Then, when I thought it should be strong,
      It opened at the matin hour
    And fell at even-song
    I watched a nest from day to day,
      A green nest full of pleasant shade,
      Wherein three speckled eggs were laid:
    But when they should have hatched in May,
      The two old birds had grown afraid
    Or tired, and flew away
    Then in my wrath I broke the bough
      That I had tended so with care,
      Hoping its scent should fill the air;
    I crushed the eggs, not heeding how
      Their ancient promise had been fair:
    I would have vengeance now
    But the dead branch spoke from the sod,
      And the eggs answered me again:
      Because we failed dost thou complain?
    Is thy wrath just? And what if God,
      Who waiteth for thy fruits in vain,
    Should also take the rod
    Flowers preach to us if we will hear:--
    The rose saith in the dewy morn,
    I am most fair;
    Yet all my loveliness is born
    Upon a thorn.
    The poppy saith amid the corn:
    Let but my scarlet head appear
    And I am held in scorn;
    Yet juice of subtle virtue lies
    Within my cup of curious dyes.
    The lilies say: Behold how we
    Preach without words of purity.
    The violets whisper from the shade
    Which their own leaves have made:
    Men scent our fragrance on the air,
    Yet take no heed
    Of humble lessons we would read
    But not alone the fairest flowers:
    The merest grass
    Along the roadside where we pass,
    Lichen and moss and sturdy weed,
    Tell of His love who sends the dew,
    The rain and sunshine too,
    To nourish one small seed
    By day she wooes me, soft, exceeding fair:
      But all night as the moon so changeth she;
      Loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy,
    And subtle serpents gliding in her hair.
    By day she wooes me to the outer air,
      Ripe fruits, sweet flowers, and full satiety:
      But through the night, a beast she grins at me,
    A very monster void of love and prayer.
    By day she stands a lie: by night she stands,
      In all the naked horror of the truth,
    With pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands.
    Is this a friend indeed; that I should sell
      My soul to her, give her my life and youth,
    Till my feet, cloven too, take hold on hell
    I said of laughter, it is vain.
      Of mirth I said, what profits it?
      Therefore I found a book, and writ
    Therein how ease and also pain,
    How health and sickness, every one
    Is vanity beneath the sun
    Man walks in a vain shadow; he
      Disquieteth himself in vain.
      The things that were shall be again.
    The rivers do not fill the sea,
    But turn back to their secret source;
    The winds too turn upon their course
    Our treasures moth and rust corrupt,
      Or thieves break through and steal, or they
      Make themselves wings and fly away.
    One man made merry as he supped,
    Nor guessed how when that night grew dim
    His soul would be required of him
    We build our houses on the sand,
      Comely withoutside and within;
      But when the winds and rains begin
    To beat on them, they cannot stand;
    They perish, quickly overthrown,
    Loose from the very basement stone
    All things are vanity, I said,--
      Yea, vanity of vanities.
      The rich man dies; and the poor dies;
    The worm feeds sweetly on the dead.
    Whate'er thou lackest, keep this trust:
    All in the end shall have but dust
    The one inheritance, which best
      And worst alike shall find and share:
      The wicked cease from troubling there,
    And there the weary be at rest;
    There all the wisdom of the wise
    Is vanity of vanities
    Man flourishes as a green leaf,
      And as a leaf doth pass away;
      Or, as a shade that cannot stay
    And leaves no track, his course is brief:
    Yet man doth hope and fear and plan
    Till he is dead:--O foolish man
    Our eyes cannot be satisfied
      With seeing, nor our ears be filled
      With hearing: yet we plant and build
    And buy and make our borders wide;
    We gather wealth, we gather care,
    But know not who shall be our heir
    Why should we hasten to arise
      So early, and so late take rest?
      Our labor is not good; our best
    Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies:
    Verily, we sow wind; and we
    Shall reap the whirlwind, verily
    He who hath little shall not lack;
      He who hath plenty shall decay:
      Our fathers went; we pass away;
    Our children follow on our track:
    So generations fail, and so
    They are renewed and come and go
    The earth is fattened with our dead;
      She swallows more and doth not cease:
      Therefore her wine and oil increase
    And her sheaves are not numberèd;
    Therefore her plants are green, and all
    Her pleasant trees lusty and tall
    Therefore the maidens cease to sing,
      And the young men are very sad;
      Therefore the sowing is not glad,
    And mournful is the harvesting.
    Of high and low, of great and small,
    Vanity is the lot of all
    A King dwelt in Jerusalem;
      He was the wisest man on earth;
      He had all riches from his birth,
    And pleasures till he tired of them;
    Then, having tested all things, he
    Witnessed that all are vanity
    Sound the deep waters:--
      Who shall sound that deep?--
    Too short the plummet,
      And the watchmen sleep.
    Some dream of effort
      Up a toilsome steep;
    Some dream of pasture grounds
      For harmless sheep
    White shapes flit to and fro
      From mast to mast;
    They feel the distant tempest
      That nears them fast:
    Great rocks are straight ahead,
      Great shoals not past;
    They shout to one another
      Upon the blast
    O, soft the streams drop music
      Between the hills,
    And musical the birds' nests
      Beside those rills:
    The nests are types of home
       Love-hidden from ills,
    The nests are types of spirits
      Love-music fills
    So dream the sleepers,
      Each man in his place;
    The lightning shows the smile
      Upon each face:
    The ship is driving, driving,
      It drives apace:
    And sleepers smile, and spirits
      Bewail their case
    The lightning glares and reddens
      Across the skies;
    It seems but sunset
      To those sleeping eyes.
    When did the sun go down
      On such a wise?
    From such a sunset
      When shall day arise
    "Wake," call the spirits:
      But to heedless ears;
    They have forgotten sorrows
      And hopes and fears;
    They have forgotten perils
      And smiles and tears;
    Their dream has held them long,
      Long years and years
    "Wake," call the spirits again:
      But it would take
    A louder summons
      To bid them awake.
    Some dream of pleasure
      For another's sake;
    Some dream, forgetful
      Of a lifelong ache
    One by one slowly,
      Ah, how sad and slow!
    Wailing and praying
      The spirits rise and go:
    Clear stainless spirits,
      White,--as white as snow;
    Pale spirits, wailing
      For an overthrow
    One by one flitting,
      Like a mournful bird
    Whose song is tired at last
      For no mate heard.
    The loving voice is silent,
      The useless word;
    One by one flitting,
      Sick with hope deferred
    Driving and driving,
      The ship drives amain:
    While swift from mast to mast
      Shapes flit again,
    Flit silent as the silence
      Where men lie slain;
    Their shadow cast upon the sails
      Is like a stain
    No voice to call the sleepers,
      No hand to raise:
    They sleep to death in dreaming
      Of length of days.
    Vanity of vanities,
      The Preacher says:
    Vanity is the end
      Of all their ways
    The first was like a dream through summer heat,
      The second like a tedious numbing swoon,
    While the half-frozen pulses lagged to beat
      Beneath a winter moon
    "But," says my friend, "what was this thing and where?"
      It was a pleasure-place within my soul;
    An earthly paradise supremely fair
      That lured me from the goal
    The first part was a tissue of hugged lies;
      The second was its ruin fraught with pain:
    Why raise the fair delusion to the skies
      But to be dashed again
    My castle stood of white transparent glass
      Glittering and frail with many a fretted spire,
    But when the summer sunset came to pass
      It kindled into fire
    My pleasaunce was an undulating green,
      Stately with trees whose shadows slept below,
    With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between,
      Like flame or sky or snow
    Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease,
      With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife;
    All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees
      Fulfilled their careless life
    Wood-pigeons cooed there, stock-doves nestled there;
      My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit,
    Their branches spread a city to the air,
      And mice lodged in their root
    My heath lay farther off, where lizards lived
      In strange metallic mail, just spied and gone;
    Like darted lightnings here and there perceived
      But nowhere dwelt upon
    Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod
      And propagate in peace, an uncouth crew,
    Where velvet-headed rushes rustling nod
      And spill the morning dew
    All caterpillars throve beneath my rule,
      With snails and slugs in corners out of sight;
    I never marred the curious sudden stool
      That perfects in a night
    Safe in his excavated gallery
      The burrowing mole groped on from year to year;
    No harmless hedgehog curled because of me
      His prickly back for fear
    Ofttimes one like an angel walked with me,
      With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire,
    But deep as the unfathomed endless sea
      Fulfilling my desire
    And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair,
      And sometimes like a sunset glorious red,
    And sometimes he had wings to scale the air
      With aureole round his head
    We sang our songs together by the way,
      Calls and recalls and echoes of delight;
    So communed we together all the day,
      And so in dreams by night
    I have no words to tell what way we walked,
      What unforgotten path now closed and sealed;
    I have no words to tell all things we talked,
      All things that he revealed
    This only can I tell: that hour by hour
      I waxed more feastful, lifted up and glad;
    I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower,
      Felt not my friend was sad
    "To-morrow," once I said to him with smiles:
      "To-night," he answered gravely and was dumb,
    But pointed out the stones that numbered miles
      And miles and miles to come
    "Not so," I said: "to-morrow shall be sweet;
      To-night is not so sweet as coming days."
    Then first I saw that he had turned his feet,
      Had turned from me his face
    Running and flying miles and miles he went,
      But once looked back to beckon with his hand
    And cry: "Come home, O love, from banishment:
      Come to the distant land
    That night destroyed me like an avalanche;
      One night turned all my summer back to snow:
    Next morning not a bird upon my branch,
      Not a lamb woke below
    No bird, no lamb, no living breathing thing;
      No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn,
    No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing
      And fled before that dawn
    Azure and sun were starved from heaven above,
      No dew had fallen, but biting frost lay hoar:
    O love, I knew that I should meet my love,
      Should find my love no more
    "My love no more," I muttered, stunned with pain:
      I shed no tear, I wrung no passionate hand,
    Till something whispered: "You shall meet again,
      Meet in a distant land
    Then with a cry like famine I arose,
      I lit my candle, searched from room to room,
    Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze
      Swept through the blank of gloom
    I searched day after day, night after night;
      Scant change there came to me of night or day:
    "No more," I wailed, "no more"; and trimmed my light,
      And gnashed, but did not pray
    Until my heart broke and my spirit broke:
      Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled, fell,
    And moaned: "It is enough: withhold the stroke.
      Farewell, O love, farewell
    Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song
      Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me:
    One cried: "Our sister, she hath suffered long."--
      One answered: "Make her see
    One cried: "O blessed she who no more pain,
      Who no more disappointment shall receive."--
    One answered: "Not so: she must live again;
      Strengthen thou her to live
    So, while I lay entranced, a curtain seemed
      To shrivel with crackling from before my face,
    Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed
      And showed a certain place
    I saw a vision of a woman, where
      Night and new morning strive for domination;
    Incomparably pale, and almost fair,
      And sad beyond expression
    Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem,
      Were stately like the stars, and yet were tender,
    Her figure charmed me like a windy stem
      Quivering and drooped and slender
    I stood upon the outer barren ground,
      She stood on inner ground that budded flowers;
    While circling in their never-slackening round
      Danced by the mystic hours
    But every flower was lifted on a thorn,
      And every thorn shot upright from its sands
    To gall her feet; hoarse laughter pealed in scorn
      With cruel clapping hands
    She bled and wept, yet did not shrink; her strength
      Was strung up until daybreak of delight:
    She measured measureless sorrow toward its length,
      And breadth, and depth, and height
    Then marked I how a chain sustained her form,
      A chain of living links not made nor riven:
    It stretched sheer up through lightning, wind, and storm,
      And anchored fast in heaven
    One cried: "How long? yet founded on the Rock
      She shall do battle, suffer, and attain."--
    One answered: "Faith quakes in the tempest shock:
      Strengthen her soul again
    I saw a cup sent down and come to her
      Brimful of loathing and of bitterness:
    She drank with livid lips that seemed to stir
      The depth, not make it less
    But as she drank I spied a hand distil
      New wine and virgin honey; making it
    First bitter-sweet, then sweet indeed, until
      She tasted only sweet
    Her lips and cheeks waxed rosy-fresh and young;
      Drinking she sang: "My soul shall nothing want";
    And drank anew: while soft a song was sung,
      A mystical slow chant
    One cried: "The wounds are faithful of a friend:
      The wilderness shall blossom as a rose."--
    One answered: "Rend the veil, declare the end,
      Strengthen her ere she goes
    Then earth and heaven were rolled up like a scroll;
      Time and space, change and death, had passed away;
    Weight, number, measure, each had reached its whole:
      The day had come, that day
    Multitudes--multitudes--stood up in bliss,
      Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair;
    With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace,
      And crowned and haloed hair
    They sang a song, a new song in the height,
      Harping with harps to Him Who is Strong and True:
    They drank new wine, their eyes saw with new light,
      Lo, all things were made new
    Tier beyond tier they rose and rose and rose
      So high that it was dreadful, flames with flames:
    No man could number them, no tongue disclose
      Their secret sacred names
    As though one pulse stirred all, one rush of blood
      Fed all, one breath swept through them myriad voiced,
    They struck their harps, cast down their crowns, they stood
      And worshipped and rejoiced
    Each face looked one way like a moon new-lit,
      Each face looked one way towards its Sun of Love;
    Drank love and bathed in love and mirrored it
      And knew no end thereof
    Glory touched glory on each blessed head,
      Hands locked dear hands never to sunder more:
    These were the new-begotten from the dead
      Whom the great birthday bore
    Heart answered heart, soul answered soul at rest,
      Double against each other, filled, sufficed:
    All loving, loved of all; but loving best
      And best beloved of Christ
    I saw that one who lost her love in pain,
      Who trod on thorns, who drank the loathsome cup;
    The lost in night, in day was found again;
      The fallen was lifted up
    They stood together in the blessed noon,
      They sang together through the length of days;
    Each loving face bent Sunwards like a moon
      New-lit with love and praise
    Therefore, O friend, I would not if I might
      Rebuild my house of lies, wherein I joyed
    One time to dwell: my soul shall walk in white,
      Cast down but not destroyed
    Therefore in patience I possess my soul;
      Yea, therefore as a flint I set my face,
    To pluck down, to build up again the whole--
      But in a distant place
    These thorns are sharp, yet I can tread on them;
      This cup is loathsome, yet He makes it sweet;
    My face is steadfast toward Jerusalem,
      My heart remembers it
    I lift the hanging hands, the feeble knees--
      I, precious more than seven times molten gold--
    Until the day when from His storehouses
      God shall bring new and old
    Beauty for ashes, oil of joy for grief,
      Garment of praise for spirit of heaviness:
    Although to-day I fade as doth a leaf,
      I languish and grow less
    Although to-day He prunes my twigs with pain,
      Yet doth His blood nourish and warm my root:
    To-morrow I shall put forth buds again,
      And clothe myself with fruit
    Although to-day I walk in tedious ways,
      To-day His staff is turned into a rod,
    Yet will I wait for Him the appointed days
      And stay upon my God
    New Year met me somewhat sad:
      Old Year leaves me tired,
    Stripped of favorite things I had,
      Balked of much desired:
    Yet farther on my road to-day,
    God willing, farther on my way
    New Year coming on apace
      What have you to give me?
    Bring you scathe, or bring you grace,
    Face me with an honest face;
      You shall not deceive me:
    Be it good or ill, be it what you will,
    It needs shall help me on my road,
    My rugged way to heaven, please God
    Watch with me, men, women, and children dear,
    You whom I love, for whom I hope and fear,
    Watch with me this last vigil of the year.
    Some hug their business, some their pleasure-scheme;
    Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream;
    Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart
    Watch with me, blessed spirits, who delight
    All through the holy night to walk in white,
    Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight.
    I know not if they watch with me: I know
    They count this eve of resurrection slow,
    And cry, "How long?" with urgent utterance strong
    Watch with me, Jesus, in my loneliness:
    Though others say me nay, yet say Thou yes;
    Though others pass me by, stop Thou to bless.
    Yea, Thou dost stop with me this vigil night;
    To-night of pain, to-morrow of delight:
    I, Love, am Thine; Thou, Lord, my God, art mine
    Passing away, saith the World, passing away:
    Chances, beauty and youth sapped day by day:
    Thy life never continueth in one stay.
    Is the eye waxen dim, is the dark hair changing to gray
    That hath won neither laurel nor bay?
    I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May:
    Thou, root-stricken, shalt not rebuild thy decay
    On my bosom for aye.
    Then I answered: Yea
    Passing away, saith my Soul, passing away:
    With its burden of fear and hope, of labor and play;
    Hearken what the past doth witness and say:
    Rust in thy gold, a moth is in thine array,
    A canker is in thy bud, thy leaf must decay.
    At midnight, at cock-crow, at morning, one certain day
    Lo, the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay:
    Watch thou and pray.
    Then I answered: Yea
    Passing away, saith my God, passing away:
    Winter passeth after the long delay:
    New grapes on the vine, new figs on the tender spray,
    Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May.
    Though I tarry, wait for Me, trust Me, watch and pray.
    Arise, come away, night is past, and lo it is day,
    My love, My sister, My spouse, thou shalt hear Me say.
    Then I answered: Yea
    It is over. What is over?
      Nay, how much is over truly!--
    Harvest days we toiled to sow for;
      Now the sheaves are gathered newly,
      Now the wheat is garnered duly
    It is finished. What is finished?
      Much is finished known or unknown:
    Lives are finished; time diminished;
      Was the fallow field left unsown?
      Will these buds be always unblown
    It suffices. What suffices?
      All suffices reckoned rightly:
    Spring shall bloom where now the ice is,
      Roses make the bramble sightly,
      And the quickening sun shine brightly,
      And the latter wind blow lightly,
    And my garden teem with spices
    Oh what is that country
      And where can it be,
    Not mine own country,
      But dearer far to me?
    Yet mine own country,
      If I one day may see
    Its spices and cedars,
      Its gold and ivory
    As I lie dreaming
      It rises, that land;
    There rises before me
      Its green golden strand,
    With the bowing cedars
      And the shining sand;
    It sparkles and flashes
      Like a shaken brand
    Do angels lean nearer
      While I lie and long?
    I see their soft plumage
      And catch their windy song,
    Like the rise of a high tide
      Sweeping full and strong;
    I mark the outskirts
      Of their reverend throng
    Oh what is a king here,
      Or what is a boor?
    Here all starve together,
      All dwarfed and poor;
    Here Death's hand knocketh
      At door after door,
    He thins the dancers
      From the festal floor
    Oh what is a handmaid,
      Or what is a queen?
    All must lie down together
      Where the turf is green,
    The foulest face hidden,
      The fairest not seen;
    Gone as if never
      They had breathed or been
    Gone from sweet sunshine
      Underneath the sod,
    Turned from warm flesh and blood
      To senseless clod;
    Gone as if never
      They had toiled or trod,
    Gone out of sight of all
      Except our God
    Shut into silence
      From the accustomed song
    Shut into solitude
      From all earth's throng,
    Run down though swift of foot,
      Thrust down though strong;
    Life made an end of,
      Seemed it short or long
    Life made an end of,
      Life but just begun;
    Life finished yesterday,
      Its last sand run;
    Life new-born with the morrow
      Fresh as the sun:
    While done is done for ever;
      Undone, undone
    And if that life is life,
      This is but a breath,
    The passage of a dream
      And the shadow of death;
    But a vain shadow
      If one considereth;
    Vanity of vanities,
      As the Preacher saith
    [Illustration: _The long hours go and come and go_
    Till all sweet gums and juices flow,
    Till the blossom of blossoms blow,
    The long hours go and come and go,
      The bride she sleepeth, waketh, sleepeth,
    Waiting for one whose coming is slow:--
        Hark! the bride weepeth
    "How long shall I wait, come heat come rime?"--
    "Till the strong Prince comes, who must come in time,"
    Her women say. "There's a mountain to climb,
      A river to ford. Sleep, dream and sleep:
    Sleep," they say: "we've muffled the chime,
        Better dream than weep
    In his world-end palace the strong Prince sat,
    Taking his ease on cushion and mat,
    Close at hand lay his staff and his hat
      "When wilt thou start? the bride waits, O youth."--
    "Now the moon's at full; I tarried for that,
        Now I start in truth
    "But tell me first, true voice of my doom,
    Of my veiled bride in her maiden bloom;
    Keeps she watch through glare and through gloom,
      Watch for me asleep and awake?"--
    "Spell-bound she watches in one white room,
        And is patient for thy sake
    "By her head lilies and rosebuds grow;
    The lilies droop,--will the rosebuds blow?
    The silver slim lilies hang the head low;
      Their stream is scanty, their sunshine rare;
    Let the sun blaze out, and let the stream flow,
        They will blossom and wax fair
    "Red and white poppies grow at her feet,
    The blood-red wait for sweet summer heat,
    Wrapped in bud-coats hairy and neat;
      But the white buds swell; one day they will burst,
    Will open their death-cups drowsy and sweet,--
        Which will open the first
    Then a hundred sad voices lifted a wail,
    And a hundred glad voices piped on the gale:
    "Time is short, life is short," they took up the tale:
      "Life is sweet, love is sweet, use to-day while you may;
    Love is sweet, and to-morrow may fail;
        Love is sweet, use to-day
    While the song swept by, beseeching and meek,
    Up rose the Prince with a flush on his cheek,
    Up he rose to stir and to seek,
      Going forth in the joy of his strength;
    Strong of limb, if of purpose weak,
        Starting at length
    Forth he set in the breezy morn,
    Across green fields of nodding corn,
    As goodly a Prince as ever was born,
      Carolling with the carolling lark;--
    Sure his bride will be won and worn,
        Ere fall of the dark
    So light his step, so merry his smile,
    A milkmaid loitered beside a stile,
    Set down her pail and rested awhile,
      A wave-haired milkmaid, rosy and white;
    The Prince, who had journeyed at least a mile,
        Grew athirst at the sight
    "Will you give me a morning draught?"--
    "You're kindly welcome," she said, and laughed.
    He lifted the pail, new milk he quaffed;
      Then wiping his curly black beard like silk:
    "Whitest cow that ever was calved
        Surely gave you this milk
    Was it milk now, or was it cream?
    Was she a maid, or an evil dream?
    Her eyes began to glitter and gleam;
      He would have gone, but he stayed instead;
    Green they gleamed as he looked in them:
        "Give me my fee," she said
    "I will give you a jewel of gold."--
    "Not so; gold is heavy and cold."--
    "I will give you a velvet fold
      Of foreign work your beauty to deck."--
    "Better I like my kerchief rolled
        Light and white round my neck
    "Nay," cried he, "but fix your own fee."--
    She laughed, "You may give the full moon to me;
    Or else sit under this apple-tree
      Here for one idle day by my side;
    After that I'll let you go free,
        And the world is wide
    Loath to stay, but to leave her slack,
    He half turned away, then he quite turned back:
    For courtesy's sake he could not lack
      To redeem his own royal pledge;
    Ahead, too, the windy heaven lowered black
        With a fire-cloven edge
    So he stretched his length in the apple-tree shade,
    Lay and laughed and talked to the maid,
    Who twisted her hair in a cunning braid,
      And writhed it in shining serpent-coils,
    And held him a day and night fast laid
          In her subtle toils
    At the death of night and the birth of day,
    When the owl left off his sober play,
    And the bat hung himself out of the way,
      Woke the song of mavis and merle,
    And heaven put off its hodden gray
        For mother-o'-pearl
    Peeped up daisies here and there,
    Here, there, and everywhere;
    Rose a hopeful lark in the air,
      Spreading out towards the sun his breast;
    While the moon set solemn and fair
        Away in the west
    "Up, up, up," called the watchman lark,
    In his clear réveillée: "Hearken, O hark!
    Press to the high goal, fly to the mark.
      Up, O sluggard, new morn is born;
    If still asleep when the night falls dark,
        Thou must wait a second morn
    "Up, up, up," sad glad voices swelled:
    "So the tree falls and lies as it's felled.
    Be thy bands loosed, O sleeper, long held
      In sweet sleep whose end is not sweet.
    Be the slackness girt and the softness quelled
        And the slowness fleet
    Off he set. The grass grew rare,
    A blight lurked in the darkening air,
    The very moss grew hueless and spare,
      The last daisy stood all astunt;
    Behind his back the soil lay bare,
        But barer in front
    A land of chasm and rent, a land
    Of rugged blackness on either hand:
    If water trickled, its track was tanned
      With an edge of rust to the chink;
    If one stamped on stone or on sand
        It returned a clink
    A lifeless land, a loveless land,
    Without lair or nest on either hand:
    Only scorpions jerked in the sand,
      Black as black iron, or dusty pale;
    From point to point sheer rock was manned
        By scorpions in mail
    A land of neither life nor death,
    Where no man buildeth or fashioneth,
    Where none draws living or dying breath;
      No man cometh or goeth there,
    No man doeth, seeketh, saith,
        In the stagnant air
    Some old volcanic upset must
    Have rent the crust and blackened the crust;
    Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust
      Above earth's molten centre at seethe,
    Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust
        Of fire beneath
    Untrodden before, untrodden since:
    Tedious land for a social Prince;
    Halting, he scanned the outs and ins,
      Endless, labyrinthine, grim,
    Of the solitude that made him wince,
      Laying wait for him
    By bulging rock and gaping cleft,
    Even of half mere daylight reft,
    Rueful he peered to right and left,
      Muttering in his altered mood:
    "The fate is hard that weaves my weft,
        Though my lot be good
    Dim the changes of day to night,
    Of night scarce dark to day not bright.
    Still his road wound towards the right,
      Still he went, and still he went,
    Till one night he spied a light,
        In his discontent
    Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave,
    Like a red-hot eye from a grave.
    No man stood there of whom to crave
      Rest for wayfarer plodding by:
    Though the tenant were churl or knave
        The Prince might try
    In he passed and tarried not,
    Groping his way from spot to spot,
    Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--
      An old, old mortal, cramped and double,
    Was peering into a seething-pot,
        In a world of trouble
    The veriest atomy he looked,
    With grimy fingers clutching and crooked,
    Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked,
      And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way;
    Blinking, his eyes had scarcely brooked
        The light of day
    Stared the Prince, for the sight was new;
    Stared, but asked without more ado:
    "May a weary traveller lodge with you,
      Old father, here in your lair?
    In your country the inns seem few,
        And scanty the fare
    The head turned not to hear him speak;
    The old voice whistled as through a leak
    (Out it came in a quavering squeak):
      "Work for wage is a bargain fit:
    If there's aught of mine that you seek
        You must work for it
    "Buried alive from light and air
    This year is the hundredth year,
    I feed my fire with a sleepless care,
      Watching my potion wane or wax:
    Elixir of Life is simmering there,
        And but one thing lacks
    "If you're fain to lodge here with me,
    Take that pair of bellows you see,--
    Too heavy for my old hands they be,--
      Take the bellows and puff and puff:
    When the steam curls rosy and free
        The broth's boiled enough
    "Then take your choice of all I have;
    I will give you life if you crave.
    Already I'm mildewed for the grave,
      So first myself I must drink my fill:
    But all the rest may be yours, to save
        Whomever you will
    "Done," quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood.
    First he piled on resinous wood,
    Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;
      Thinking, "My love and I will live.
    If I tarry, why life is good,
        And she may forgive
    The pot began to bubble and boil;
    The old man cast in essence and oil,
    He stirred all up with a triple coil
      Of gold and silver and iron wire,
    Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil,
        And fed the fire
    But still the steam curled watery white;
    Night turned to day and day to night;
    One thing lacked, by his feeble sight
      Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind:
    Life might miss him, but Death the blight
        Was sure to find
    So when the hundredth year was full
    The thread was cut and finished the school.
    Death snapped the old worn-out tool,
      Snapped him short while he stood and stirred
    (Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)
        With never a word
    Thus at length the old crab was nipped.
    The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped
    In the broth as the dead man slipped,--
      That same instant, a rosy red
    Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped
        Round the dead old head
    The last ingredient was supplied
    (Unless the dead man mistook or lied).
    Up started the Prince, he cast aside
      The bellows plied through the tedious trial,
    Made sure that his host had died,
        And filled a phial
    "One night's rest," thought the Prince. "This done,
    Forth I speed with the rising sun:
    With the morrow I rise and run,
      Come what will of wind or of weather.
    This draught of Life when my Bride is won
        We'll drink together
    Thus the dead man stayed in his grave,
    Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave;
    There he stayed, were he fool or knave,
      Or honest seeker who had not found;
    While the Prince outside was prompt to crave
        Sleep on the ground
    "If she watches, go bid her sleep;
    Bid her sleep, for the road is steep:
    He can sleep who holdeth her cheap,
      Sleep and wake and sleep again.
    Let him sow, one day he shall reap,
        Let him sow the grain
    "When there blows a sweet garden rose,
    Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:
    But if one knows when the sweet thing blows,
      Knows, and lets it open and drop,
    If but a nettle his garden grows
        He hath earned the crop
    Through his sleep the summons rang,
    Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.
    Slow he woke with a drowsy pang,
      Shook himself without much debate,
    Turned where he saw green branches hang,
        Started though late
    For the black land was travelled o'er,
    He should see the grim land no more.
    A flowering country stretched before
      His face when the lovely day came back:
    He hugged the phial of Life he bore,
        And resumed his track
    By willow courses he took his path,
    Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath,
    Marked the fields green to aftermath,
      Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran,
    Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath,
        Yawned for a fellow-man
    Up on the hills not a soul in view,
    In the vale not many nor few;
    Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new.
      It's O for a second maiden, at least,
    To bear the flagon, and taste it too,
        And flavor the feast
    Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve;
    Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve.
    At length the water-bed took a curve,
      The deep river swept its bank-side bare;
    Waters streamed from the hill-reserve,--
        Waters here, waters there
    High above, and deep below,
    Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow,
    Like hill-torrents after the snow,--
      Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife,
    Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,--
        He must swim for his life
    Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim
    With the dizzying whirl,--which way to swim?
    The thunderous downshoot deafened him;
      Half he choked in the lashing spray:
    Life is sweet, and the grave is grim,--
        Which way?--which way
    A flash of light, a shout from the strand:
    "This way,--this way; here lies the land!"
    His phial clutched in one drowning hand;
      He catches,--misses,--catches a rope;
    His feet slip on the slipping sand:
        Is there life?--is there hope
    Just saved, without pulse or breath,--
    Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;
    Laid where a willow shadoweth,--
      Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.
    (O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth
        For all thy sweet youth
    Kind hands do and undo,
    Kind voices whisper and coo:
    "I will chafe his hands,"--"and I,"--"and you
      Raise his head, put his hair aside."
    (If many laugh, one well may rue:
        Sleep on, thou Bride
    So the Prince was tended with care:
    One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;
    Two chafed his hands, and did not spare;
      But one propped his head that drooped awry
    Till his eyes oped, and at unaware
        They met eye to eye
    O, a moon face in a shadowy place,
    And a light touch and a winsome grace,
    And a thrilling tender voice which says:
      "Safe from waters that seek the sea,--
    Cold waters by rugged ways,--
        Safe with me
    While overhead bird whistles to bird,
    And round about plays a gamesome herd:
    "Safe with us,"--some take up the word,--
      "Safe with us, dear lord and friend:
    All the sweeter if long deferred
        Is rest in the end
    Had he stayed to weigh and to scan,
    He had been more or less than a man:
    He did what a young man can,
    Spoke of toil and an arduous way,--
    Toil to-morrow, while golden ran
        The sands of to-day
    Slip past, slip fast,
    Uncounted hours from first to last,
    Many hours till the last is past,
      Many hours dwindling to one,--
    One hour whose die is cast,
        One last hour gone
    Come, gone,--gone forever,--
    Gone as an unreturning river,--
    Gone as to death the merriest liver,--
      Gone as the year at the dying fall,--
    To-morrow, to-day, yesterday, never,--
        Gone once for all
    Came at length the starting-day,
    With last words, and last, last words to say,
    With bodiless cries from far away,--
      Chiding wailing voices that rang
    Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;
        And thus they sang
    "Is there life?--the lamp burns low;
    Is there hope?--the coming is slow:
    The promise promised so long ago,
      The long promise, has not been kept.
    Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so
        Who so oft has wept
    "Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth
    As a lily drooping to death,
    As a drought-worn bird with failing breath,
      As a lovely vine without a stay,
    As a tree whereof the owner saith,
        'Hew it down to-day
    Stung by that word the Prince was fain
    To start on his tedious road again.
    He crossed the stream where a ford was plain,
      He clomb the opposite bank though steep,
    And swore to himself to strain and attain
        Ere he tasted sleep
    Huge before him a mountain frowned
    With foot of rock on the valley ground,
    And head with snows incessant crowned,
      And a cloud mantle about its strength,
    And a path which the wild goat hath not found
        In its breadth and length
    But he was strong to do and dare:
    If a host had withstood him there,
    He had braved a host with little care
      In his lusty youth and his pride,
    Tough to grapple though weak to snare.
        He comes, O Bride
    Up he went where the goat scarce clings,
    Up where the eagle folds her wings,
    Past the green line of living things,
      Where the sun cannot warm the cold,--
    Up he went as a flame enrings
        Where there seems no hold
    Up a fissure barren and black,
    Till the eagles tired upon his track,
    And the clouds were left behind his back,--
      Up till the utmost peak was past.
    Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;
        He paused at last
    Before his face a valley spread
    Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread,
    Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed,
      Where all birds made love to their kind,
    Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red
        And not hard to find
    Midway down the mountain side
    (On its green slope the path was wide)
    Stood a house for a royal bride,
      Built all of changing opal stone,
    The royal palace, till now descried
        In his dreams alone
    Less bold than in days of yore,
    Doubting now though never before,
    Doubting he goes and lags the more:
      Is the time late? does the day grow dim?
    Rose, will she open the crimson core
        Of her heart to him
    Above his head a tangle glows
    Of wine-red roses, blushes, snows,
    Closed buds and buds that unclose,
      Leaves, and moss, and prickles too;
    His hand shook as he plucked a rose,
        And the rose dropped dew
    Take heart of grace! the portion of Life
    May go far to woo him a wife:
    If she frown, yet a lover's strife
      Lightly raised can be laid again:
    A hasty word is never the knife
        To cut love in twain
    Far away stretched the royal land,
    Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned:
    Light labor more, and his foot would stand
      On the threshold, all labor done;
    Easy pleasure laid at his hand,
        And the dear Bride won
    His slackening steps pause at the gate,--
    Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late,--
    Does she sleep now, or watch and wait?
      She has watched, she has waited long,
    Watching athwart the golden grate
        With a patient song
    Fling the golden portals wide,
    The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;
    Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside,
      Let them look on each other's face,
    She in her meekness, he in his pride,--
        Day wears apace
    Day is over, the day that wore.
    What is this that comes through the door,
    The face covered, the feet before?
      This that coming takes his breath;
    This Bride not seen, to be seen no more
        Save of Bridegroom Death
    Veiled figures carrying her
    Sweep by yet make no stir;
    There is a smell of spice and myrrh,
      A bride-chant burdened with one name;
    The bride-song rises steadier
        Than the torches' flame
    "Too late for love, too late for joy,
      Too late, too late!
    You loitered on the road too long,
      You trifled at the gate:
    The enchanted dove upon her branch
        Died without a mate;
    The enchanted princess in her tower
      Slept, died, behind the grate;
    Her heart was starving all this while
        You made it wait
    "Ten years ago, five years ago,
      One year ago,
    Even then you had arrived in time,
      Though somewhat slow;
    Then you had known her living face
      Which now you cannot know:
    The frozen fountain would have leaped,
      The buds gone on to blow,
    The warm south wind would have awaked
        To melt the snow
    "Is she fair now as she lies?
      Once she was fair;
    Meet queen for any kingly king,
      With gold-dust on her hair.
    Now these are poppies in her locks,
      White poppies she must wear;
    Must wear a veil to shroud her face
      And the want graven there:
    Or is the hunger fed at length,
        Cast off the care
    "We never saw her with a smile
      Or with a frown;
    Her bed seemed never soft to her,
      Though tossed of down;
    She little heeded what she wore,
      Kirtle, or wreath, or gown;
    We think her white brows often ached
      Beneath her crown,
    Till silvery hairs showed in her locks
      That used to be so brown
    "We never heard her speak in haste:
      Her tones were sweet,
    And modulated just so much
      As it was meet:
    Her heart sat silent through the noise
      And concourse of the street.
    There was no hurry in her hands,
      No hurry in her feet;
    There was no bliss drew nigh to her,
      That she might run to greet
    "You should have wept her yesterday,
      Wasting upon her bed:
    But wherefore should you weep to-day
      That she is dead?
    Lo, we who love weep not to-day,
      But crown her royal head.
    Let be these poppies that we strew,
      Your roses are too red:
    Let be these poppies, not for you
      Cut down and spread
    [Illustration: _You should have wept her yesterday_
    Long ago and long ago,
      And long ago still,
    There dwelt three merry maidens
      Upon a distant hill.
    One was tall Meggan,
      And one was dainty May,
    But one was fair Margaret,
      More fair than I can say,
    Long ago and long ago
    When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,
      And when May pulled the brier,
    Half the birds would swoop to see,
      Half the beasts draw nigher;
    Half the fishes of the streams
      Would dart up to admire:
    But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,
      Or poppy hot aflame,
    All the beasts and all the birds
      And all the fishes came
    To her hand more soft than snow
    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      In brisk morning air,
    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      Make maidens fair.
    "I go for strawberry-leaves,"
      Meggan said one day:
    "Fair Margaret can bide at home,
      But you come with me, May;
    Up the hill and down the hill,
      Along the winding way,
    You and I are used to go
    So these two fair sisters
      Went with innocent will
    Up the hill and down again,
      And round the homestead hill:
    While the fairest sat at home,
      Margaret like a queen,
    Like a blush-rose, like the moon
      In her heavenly sheen,
    Fragrant-breathed as milky cow
      Or field of blossoming bean,
    Graceful as an ivy bough
      Born to cling and lean;
    Thus she sat to sing and sew
    When she raised her lustrous eyes
      A beast peeped at the door;
    When she downward cast her eyes
      A fish gasped on the floor;
    When she turned away her eyes
      A bird perched on the sill,
    Warbling out its heart of love,
      Warbling, warbling still,
    With pathetic pleadings low
    Light-foot May with Meggan
      Sought the choicest spot,
    Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
      Then, while day waxed hot,
    Sat at ease to play and rest,
      A gracious rest and play;
    The loveliest maidens near or far,
      When Margaret was away,
    Who sat at home to sing and sew
    Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,
      Wind-play tossed their hair,
    Creeping things among the grass
      Stroked them here and there;
    Meggan piped a merry note,
      A fitful, wayward lay,
    While shrill as bird on topmost twig
      Piped merry May;
    Honey-smooth the double flow
    Sped a herdsman from the vale,
      Mounting like a flame,
    All on fire to hear and see
      With floating locks he came.
    Looked neither north nor south,
      Neither east nor west,
    But sat him down at Meggan's feet
      As love-bird on his nest,
    And wooed her with a silent awe,
      With trouble not expressed;
    She sang the tears into his eyes,
      The heart out of his breast:
    So he loved her, listening so
    She sang the heart out of his breast,
      The words out of his tongue;
    Hand and foot and pulse he paused
      Till her song was sung.
    Then he spoke up from his place
      Simple words and true:
    "Scanty goods have I to give,
      Scanty skill to woo;
    But I have a will to work,
      And a heart for you:
    Bid me stay or bid me go
    Then Meggan mused within herself:
      "Better be first with him,
    Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,
      Who shines my brightness dim,
    Forever second where she sits,
      However fair I be:
    I will be lady of his love,
      And he shall worship me;
    I will be lady of his herds
      And stoop to his degree,
    At home where kids and fatlings grow
    Sped a shepherd from the height
      Headlong down to look,
    (White lambs followed, lured by love
      Of their shepherd's crook):
    He turned neither east nor west,
      Neither north nor south,
    But knelt right down to May, for love
      Of her sweet-singing mouth;
    Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks
      In parching hillside drouth;
    Forgot himself for weal or woe
    Trilled her song and swelled her song
      With maiden coy caprice
    In a labyrinth of throbs,
      Pauses, cadences;
    Clear-noted as a dropping brook,
      Soft-noted like the bees,
    Wild-noted as the shivering wind
      Forlorn through forest trees:
    Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
      Who hides herself for love,
    Yet cannot keep her secret safe,
      But cooes and cooes thereof:
    Thus the notes rang loud or low
    He hung breathless on her breath;
      Speechless, who listened well;
    Could not speak or think or wish
      Till silence broke the spell.
    Then he spoke, and spread his hands
      Pointing here and there:
    "See my sheep and see the lambs,
      Twin lambs which they bare.
    All myself I offer you,
      All my flocks and care,
    Your sweet song hath moved me so
    In her fluttered heart young May
      Mused a dubious while:
    "If he loves me as he says"--
      Her lips curved with a smile:
    "Where Margaret shines like the sun,
      I shine but like a moon;
    If sister Meggan makes her choice
      I can make mine as soon;
    At cockcrow we were sister-maids,
      We may be brides at noon."
    Said Meggan, "Yes"; May said not "No
    Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,
      Awhile she sang her song,
    Awhile sat silent, then she thought:
      "My sisters loiter long."
    That sultry noon had waned away,
      Shadows had waxen great:
    "Surely," she thought within herself,
      "My sisters loiter late."
    She rose, and peered out at the door,
      With patient heart to wait,
    And heard a distant nightingale
      Complaining of its mate;
    Then down the garden slope she walked,
      Down to the garden gate,
    Leaned on the rail and waited so
    The slope was lightened by her eyes
      Like summer lightning fair,
    Like rising of the haloed moon
      Lightened her glimmering hair,
    While her face lightened like the sun
      Whose dawn is rosy white.
    Thus crowned with maiden majesty
      She peered into the night,
    Looked up the hill and down the hill,
      To left hand and to right,
    Flashing like fire-flies to and fro
    Waiting thus in weariness
      She marked the nightingale
    Telling, if any one would heed,
      Its old complaining tale.
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Answering the bird:
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Such notes were never heard
    From any bird when Spring's in blow
    The king of all that country
      Coursing far, coursing near,
    Curbed his amber-bitted steed,
      Coursed amain to hear;
    All his princes in his train,
      Squire, and knight, and peer,
    With his crown upon his head,
      His sceptre in his hand,
    Down he fell at Margaret's knees
      Lord king of all that land,
    To her highness bending low
    Every beast and bird and fish
      Came mustering to the sound,
    Every man and every maid
      From miles of country round:
    Meggan on her herdsman's arm,
      With her shepherd, May,
    Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
      Along the hillside way;
    No foot too feeble for the ascent,
      Not any head too gray;
    Some were swift and none were slow
    So Margaret sang her sisters home
      In their marriage mirth;
    Sang free birds out of the sky,
      Beasts along the earth,
    Sang up fishes of the deep,--
      All breathing things that move
    Sang from far and sang from near
      To her lovely love;
    Sang together friend and foe
    Sang a golden-bearded king
      Straightway to her feet,
    Sang him silent where he knelt
      In eager anguish sweet.
    But when the clear voice died away,
      When longest echoes died,
    He stood up like a royal man
      And claimed her for his bride.
    So three maids were wooed and won
      In a brief May-tide,
    Long ago and long ago
    "Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
       Hear me but this once," quoth he.
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you," quoth she.
    Day was verging toward the night
      There beside the moaning sea,
    Dimness overtook the light
      There where the breakers be.
    "O Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
      I have loved you long and true."--
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you
    She was a careless, fearless girl,
      And made her answer plain;
    Outspoken she to earl or churl,
      Kind-hearted in the main,
    But somewhat heedless with her tongue,
      And apt at causing pain;
    A mirthful maiden she and young,
      Most fair for bliss or bane.
    "O, long ago I told you so,
      I tell you so to-day:
    Go you your way, and let me go
      Just my own free way
    The sea swept in with moan and foam
      Quickening the stretch of sand;
    They stood almost in sight of home;
      He strove to take her hand.
    "O, can't you take your answer then,
      And won't you understand?
    For me you're not the man of men,
      I've other plans are planned.
    You're good for Madge, or good for Cis,
      Or good for Kate, may be:
    But what's to me the good of this
      While you're not good for me
    They stood together on the beach,
      They two alone,
    And louder waxed his urgent speech,
      His patience almost gone:
    "O, say but one kind word to me,
      Jessie, Jessie Cameron."--
    "I'd be too proud to beg," quoth she,
      And pride was in her tone.
    And pride was in her lifted head,
      And in her angry eye,
    And in her foot, which might have fled,
      But would not fly
    Some say that he had gypsy blood,
      That in his heart was guile:
    Yet he had gone through fire and flood
      Only to win her smile.
    Some say his grandam was a witch,
      A black witch from beyond the Nile,
    Who kept an image in a niche
      And talked with it the while.
    And by her hut far down the lane
      Some say they would not pass at night,
    Lest they should hear an unked strain
      Or see an unked sight
    Alas, for Jessie Cameron!--
      The sea crept moaning, moaning nigher:
    She should have hastened to be gone,--
      The sea swept higher, breaking by her:
    She should have hastened to her home
      While yet the west was flushed with fire,
    But now her feet are in the foam,
      The sea-foam, sweeping higher.
    O mother, linger at your door,
      And light your lamp to make it plain;
    But Jessie she comes home no more,
      No more again
    They stood together on the strand,
      They only, each by each;
    Home, her home, was close at hand,
      Utterly out of reach.
    Her mother in the chimney nook
      Heard a startled sea-gull screech,
    But never turned her head to look
      Towards the darkening beach:
    Neighbors here and neighbors there
      Heard one scream, as if a bird
    Shrilly screaming cleft the air:--
      That was all they heard
    Jessie she comes home no more,
      Comes home never;
    Her lover's step sounds at his door
      No more forever.
    And boats may search upon the sea
      And search along the river,
    But none know where the bodies be:
      Sea-winds that shiver,
    Sea-birds that breast the blast,
      Sea-waves swelling,
    Keep the secret first and last
      Of their dwelling
    Whether the tide so hemmed them round
      With its pitiless flow,
    That when they would have gone they found
      No way to go;
    Whether she scorned him to the last
      With words flung to and fro,
    Or clung to him when hope was past,
      None will ever know:
    Whether he helped or hindered her,
      Threw up his life or lost it well,
    The troubled sea, for all its stir,
      Finds no voice to tell
    Only watchers by the dying
      Have thought they heard one pray,
    Wordless, urgent; and replying,
      One seem to say him nay:
    And watchers by the dead have heard
      A windy swell from miles away,
    With sobs and screams, but not a word
      Distinct for them to say:
    And watchers out at sea have caught
      Glimpse of a pale gleam here or there,
    Come and gone as quick as thought,
      Which might be hand or hair
    Gone were but the Winter,
      Come were but the Spring,
    I would go to a covert
      Where the birds sing
    Where in the white-thorn
      Singeth a thrush,
    And a robin sings
      In the holly-bush
    Full of fresh scents
      Are the budding boughs,
    Arching high over
      A cool green house
    Full of sweet scents,
      And whispering air
    Which sayeth softly:
      "We spread no snare
    "Here dwell in safety,
      Here dwell alone,
    With a clear stream
      And a mossy stone
    "Here the sun shineth
      Most shadily;
    Here is heard an echo
      Of the far sea,
      Though far off it be
    "O whence do you come, my dear friend, to me,
    With your golden hair all fallen below your knee,
    And your face as white as snowdrops on the lea,
    And your voice as hollow as the hollow sea
    "From the other world I come back to you,
    My locks are uncurled with dripping, drenching dew.
    You know the old, whilst I know the new:
    But to-morrow you shall know this too
    "O, not to-morrow into the dark, I pray;
    O, not to-morrow, too soon to go away:
    Here I feel warm and well-content and gay:
    Give me another year, another day
    "Am I so changed in a day and a night
    That mine own only love shrinks from me with fright,
    Is fain to turn away to left or right,
    And cover up his eyes from the sight
    "Indeed I loved you, my chosen friend,
    I loved you for life, but life has an end;
    Through sickness I was ready to tend;
    But death mars all, which we cannot mend
    "Indeed I loved you; I love you yet
    If you will stay where your bed is set,
    Where I have planted a violet
    Which the wind waves, which the dew makes wet
    "Life is gone, then love too is gone,
    It was a reed that I leant upon:
    Never doubt I will leave you alone
    And not wake you rattling bone with bone
    "I go home alone to my bed,
    Dug deep at the foot and deep at the head,
    Roofed in with a load of lead,
    Warm enough for the forgotten dead
    "But why did your tears soak through the clay,
    And why did your sobs wake me where I lay?
    I was away, far enough away:
    Let me sleep now till the Judgment Day
    She gave up beauty in her tender youth,
      Gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways;
      She covered up her eyes lest they should gaze
    On vanity, and chose the bitter truth.
    Harsh towards herself, towards others full of ruth,
      Servant of servants, little known to praise,
      Long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days:
    She schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth,
    That with the poor and stricken she might make
      A home, until the least of all sufficed
    Her wants; her own self learned she to forsake,
    Counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss.
    So with calm will she chose and bore the cross,
      And hated all for love of Jesus Christ
    They knelt in silent anguish by her bed,
      And could not weep; but calmly there she lay.
      All pain had left her; and the sun's last ray
    Shone through upon her, warming into red
    The shady curtains. In her heart she said:
      "Heaven opens; I leave these and go away:
      The Bridegroom calls,--shall the Bride seek to stay?"
    Then low upon her breast she bowed her head.
    O lily-flower, O gem of priceless worth,
      O dove with patient voice and patient eyes,
    O fruitful vine amid a land of dearth,
      O maid replete with loving purities,
    Thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth
      To raise it with the saints in Paradise
    Young Love lies sleeping
      In May-time of the year,
    Among the lilies,
      Lapped in the tender light:
    White lambs come grazing,
      White doves come building there;
    And round about him
      The May-bushes are white
    Soft moss the pillow
      For O, a softer cheek;
    Broad leaves cast shadow
      Upon the heavy eyes:
    There winds and waters
      Grow lulled and scarcely speak;
    There twilight lingers
      The longest in the skies
    Young Love lies dreaming;
      But who shall tell the dream?
    A perfect sunlight
      On rustling forest tips;
    Or perfect moonlight
      Upon a rippling stream;
    Or perfect silence,
      Or song of cherished lips
    Burn odors round him
      To fill the drowsy air;
    Weave silent dances
      Around him to and fro;
    For O, in waking,
      The sights are not so fair,
    And song and silence
      Are not like these below
    Young Love lies dreaming
      Till summer days are gone,
    Dreaming and drowsing
      Away to perfect sleep:
    He sees the beauty
      Sun hath not looked upon,
    And tastes the fountain
      Unutterably deep
    Him perfect music
      Doth hush unto his rest,
    And through the pauses
      The perfect silence calms:
    O, poor the voices
      Of earth from east to west,
    And poor earth's stillness
      Between her stately palms
    Young Love lies drowsing
      Away to poppied death;
    Cool shadows deepen
      Across the sleeping face:
    So fails the summer
      With warm, delicious breath;
    And what hath autumn
      To give us in its place
    Draw close the curtains
      Of branched evergreen;
    Change cannot touch them
      With fading fingers sere:
    Here the first violets
      Perhaps will bud unseen,
    And a dove, maybe,
      Return to nestle here
    I took my heart in my hand
      (O my love, O my love),
    I said: Let me fall or stand,
      Let me live or die,
    But this once hear me speak
      (O my love, O my love);
    Yet a woman's words are weak:
      You should speak, not
    You took my heart in your hand
      With a friendly smile,
    With a critical eye you scanned,
      Then set it down,
    And said: It is still unripe,
      Better wait awhile;
    Wait while the skylarks pipe,
      Till the corn grows brown
    As you set it down it broke,--
      Broke, but I did not wince;
    I smiled at the speech you spoke,
      At your judgment that I heard:
    But I have not often smiled
      Since then, nor questioned since,
    Nor cared for corn-flowers wild,
      Nor sung with the singing bird
    I take my heart in my hand,
      O my God, O my God,
    My broken heart in my hand:
      Thou hast seen, judge Thou.
    My hope was written on sand,
      O my God, O my God;
    Now let Thy judgment stand,--
      Yea, judge me now
    This contemned of a man,
      This marred one heedless day,
    This heart take Thou to scan
      Both within and without:
    Refine with fire its gold,
      Purge Thou its dross away,--
    Yea, hold it in Thy hold,
      Whence none can pluck it out
    I take my heart in my hand,--
      I shall not die, but live,--
    Before Thy face I stand;
      I, for Thou callest such:
    All that I have I bring,
      All that I am I give,
    Smile Thou and I shall sing,
      But shall not question much
    A song in a cornfield
      Where corn begins to fall,
    Where reapers are reaping,
      Reaping one, reaping all.
    Sing pretty Lettice,
      Sing Rachel, sing May;
    Only Marian cannot sing
      While her sweetheart's away
    Where is he gone to
      And why does he stay?
    He came across the green sea
      But for a day,
    Across the deep green sea
      To help with the hay.
    His hair was curly yellow
      And his eyes were gray,
    He laughed a merry laugh
      And said a sweet say.
    Where is he gone to
      That he comes not home?
    To-day or to-morrow
      He surely will come.
    Let him haste to joy
      Lest he lag for sorrow,
    For one weeps to-day
      Who'll not weep to-morrow
    To-day she must weep
      For gnawing sorrow,
    To-night she may sleep
      And not wake to-morrow
    May sang with Rachel
      In the waxing warm weather,
    Lettice sang with them,
      They sang all together
    "Take the wheat in your arm
      Whilst day is broad above,
    Take the wheat to your bosom,
      But not a false false love.
      Out in the fields
        Summer heat gloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wind bloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer friend showeth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wheat groweth:
    But in the winter
      When summer heat is dead
    And summer wind has veered
      And summer friend has fled,
    Only summer wheat remaineth,
      White cakes and bread.
    Take the wheat, clasp the wheat
      That's food for maid and dove;
        Take the wheat to your bosom,
          But not a false false love
    A silence of full noontide heat
      Grew on them at their toil:
    The farmer's dog woke up from sleep,
      The green snake hid her coil
    Where grass stood thickest; bird and beast
      Sought shadows as they could,
    The reaping men and women paused
      And sat down where they stood;
    They ate and drank and were refreshed,
      For rest from toil is good
    While the reapers took their ease,
      Their sickles lying by,
    Rachel sang a second strain,
      And singing seemed to sigh
        "There goes the swallow,--
        Could we but follow!
          Hasty swallow stay,
          Point us out the way;
    Look back swallow, turn back swallow, stop swallow
        "There went the swallow,--
        Too late to follow:
          Lost our note of way,
          Lost our chance to-day;
    Good by swallow, sunny swallow, wise swallow
        "After the swallow
        All sweet things follow:
          All things go their way,
          Only we must stay,
    Must not follow: good by swallow, good swallow
    Then listless Marian raised her head
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    Her voice was sweeter than that voice;
      She sang like one who grieves:
    Her voice was sweeter than its wont
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    All wondered while they heard her sing
      Like one who hopes and grieves
      "Deeper than the hail can smite,
      Deeper than the frost can bite,
      Deep asleep through day and night,
        Our delight
      "Now thy sleep no pang can break,
      No to-morrow bid thee wake,
      Not our sobs who sit and ache
        For thy sake
      "Is it dark or light below?
      O, but is it cold like snow?
      Dost thou feel the green things grow
        Fast or slow
      "Is it warm or cold beneath,
      O, but is it cold like death?
      Cold like death, without a breath,
        Cold like death
      If he comes to-day
        He will find her weeping;
      If he comes to-morrow
        He will find her sleeping;
      If he comes the next day
        He'll not find her at all,
      He may tear his curling hair,
        Beat his breast and call
    On the wind of January
      Down flits the snow,
    Travelling from the frozen North
      As cold as it can blow.
    Poor robin redbreast,
      Look where he comes;
    Let him in to feel your fire,
      And toss him of your crumbs
    On the wind in February
      Snow-flakes float still,
    Half inclined to turn to rain,
      Nipping, dripping, chill.
    Then the thaws swell the streams,
      And swollen rivers swell the sea:--
    If the winter ever ends
      How pleasant it will be
    In the wind of windy March
      The catkins drop down,
    Curly, caterpillar-like,
      Curious green and brown.
    With concourse of nest-building birds
      And leaf-buds by the way,
    We begin to think of flowers
      And life and nuts some day
    With the gusts of April
      Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall,
    On the hedged-in orchard-green,
      From the southern wall.
    Apple-trees and pear-trees
      Shed petals white or pink,
    Plum-trees and peach-trees;
      While sharp showers sink and sink
    Little brings the May breeze
      Beside pure scent of flowers,
    While all things wax and nothing wanes
      In lengthening daylight hours.
    Across the hyacinth beds
      The wind lags warm and sweet,
    Across the hawthorn tops,
      Across the blades of wheat
    In the wind of sunny June
      Thrives the red rose crop,
    Every day fresh blossoms blow
      While the first leaves drop;
    White rose and yellow rose
      And moss-rose choice to find,
    And the cottage cabbage-rose
      Not one whit behind
    On the blast of scorched July
      Drives the pelting hail,
    From thunderous lightning-clouds, that blot
      Blue heaven grown lurid-pale.
    Weedy waves are tossed ashore,
      Sea-things strange to sight
    Gasp upon the barren shore
      And fade away in light
    In the parching August wind,
      Cornfields bow the head,
    Sheltered in round valley depths,
      On low hills outspread.
    Early leaves drop loitering down
      Weightless on the breeze,
    First-fruits of the year's decay
      From the withering trees
    In brisk wind of September
      The heavy-headed fruits
    Shake upon their bending boughs
      And drop from the shoots;
    Some glow golden in the sun,
      Some show green and streaked
    Some set forth a purple bloom,
      Some blush rosy-cheeked
    In strong blast of October
      At the equinox,
    Stirred up in his hollow bed
      Broad ocean rocks;
    Plunge the ships on his bosom,
      Leaps and plunges the foam,--
    It's O for mothers' sons at sea,
      That they were safe at home
    In slack wind of November
      The fog forms and shifts;
    All the world comes out again
      When the fog lifts.
    Loosened from their sapless twigs
      Leaves drop with every gust;
    Drifting, rustling, out of sight
      In the damp or dust
    Last of all, December,
      The year's sands nearly run,
    Speeds on the shortest day,
      Curtails the sun;
    With its bleak raw wind
      Lays the last leaves low,
    Brings back the nightly frosts,
      Brings back the snow
    How comes it, Flora, that, whenever we
    Play cards together, you invariably,
      However the pack parts,
      Still hold the Queen of Hearts
    I've scanned you with a scrutinizing gaze,
    Resolved to fathom these your secret ways:
      But, sift them as I will,
      Your ways are secret still
    I cut and shuffle; shuffle, cut, again;
    But all my cutting, shuffling, proves in vain:
      Vain hope, vain forethought, too;
      That Queen still falls to you
    I dropped her once, prepense; but, ere the deal
    Was dealt, your instinct seemed her loss to feel:
      "There should be one card more,"
      You said, and searched the floor
    I cheated once: I made a private notch
    In Heart-Queen's back, and kept a lynx-eyed watch;
      Yet such another back
      Deceived me in the pack
    The Queen of Clubs assumed by arts unknown
    An imitative dint that seemed my own;
      This notch, not of my doing,
      Misled me to my ruin
    It baffles me to puzzle out the clew,
    Which must be skill, or craft, or luck in you:
      Unless, indeed, it be
      Natural affinity
    I will tell you when they met:
    In the limpid days of Spring;
    Elder boughs were budding yet,
    Oaken boughs looked wintry still,
    But primrose and veined violet
    In the mossful turf were set,
    While meeting birds made haste to sing
    And build with right good will
    I will tell you when they parted:
    When plenteous Autumn sheaves were brown,
    Then they parted heavy-hearted;
    The full rejoicing sun looked down
    As grand as in the days before;
    Only they had lost a crown;
    Only to them those days of yore
    Could come back nevermore
    When shall they meet? I cannot tell,
    Indeed, when they shall meet again,
    Except some day in Paradise:
    For this they wait, one waits in pain.
    Beyond the sea of death love lies
    Forever, yesterday, to-day;
    Angels shall ask them, "Is it well?"
    And they shall answer, "Yea
    "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Thus the Raven spoke,
    Perched on his crooked tree
    As hoarse as hoarse could be.
    Shun him and fear him,
    Lest the Bridegroom hear him;
    Scout him and rout him
    With his ominous eye about him
    Yet, "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Still tolled from the oak;
    From that fatal black bird,
    Whether heard or unheard:
    "O ship upon the high seas,
    Freighted with lives and spices,
    Sink, O ship," croaked the Raven:
    "Let the Bride mount to heaven
    In a far foreign land
    Upon the wave-edged sand,
    Some friends gaze wistfully
    Across the glittering sea.
    "If we could clasp our sister,"
    Three say, "now we have missed her!"
    "If we could kiss our daughter!"
    Two sigh across the water
    O, the ship sails fast,
    With silken flags at the mast,
    And the home-wind blows soft;
    But a Raven sits aloft,
    Chuckling and choking,
    Croaking, croaking, croaking:--
    Let the beacon-fire blaze higher;
    Bridegroom, watch; the Bride draws nigher
    On a sloped sandy beach,
    Which the spring-tide billows reach,
    Stand a watchful throng
    Who have hoped and waited long:
    "Fie on this ship, that tarries
    With the priceless freight it carries.
    The time seems long and longer:
    O languid wind, wax stronger
    Whilst the Raven perched at ease
    Still croaks and does not cease,
    One monotonous note
    Tolled from his iron throat:
    "No father, no mother,
    But I have a sable brother:
    He sees where ocean flows to,
    And he knows what he knows, too
    A day and a night
    They kept watch worn and white;
    A night and a day
    For the swift ship on its way:
    For the Bride and her maidens,--
    Clear chimes the bridal cadence,--
    For the tall ship that never
    Hove in sight forever
    On either shore, some
    Stand in grief loud or dumb
    As the dreadful dread
    Grows certain though unsaid.
    For laughter there is weeping,
    And waking instead of sleeping,
    And a desperate sorrow
    Morrow after morrow
    O, who knows the truth,
    How she perished in her youth,
    And like a queen went down
    Pale in her royal crown?
    How she went up to glory
    From the sea-foam chill and hoary,
    From the sea-depth black and riven
    To the calm that is in Heaven
    They went down, all the crew,
    The silks and spices too,
    The great ones and the small,
    One and all, one and all.
    Was it through stress of weather,
    Quicksands, rocks, or all together?
    Only the Raven knows this,
    And he will not disclose this
    After a day and a year
    The bridal bells chime clear;
    After a year and a day
    The Bridegroom is brave and gay:
    Love is sound, faith is rotten;
    The old Bride is forgotten:--
    Two ominous Ravens only
    Remember, black and lonely
These two pieces, written during the suspense of a great nation's agony,
aim at expressing human sympathy, not political bias
    All her corn-fields rippled in the sunshine,
      All her lovely vines, sweets-laden, bowed;
    Yet some weeks to harvest and to vintage:
      When, as one man's hand, a cloud
    Rose and spread, and, blackening, burst asunder
          In rain and fire and thunder
    Is there nought to reap in the day of harvest?
      Hath the vine in her day no fruit to yield?
    Yea, men tread the press, but not for sweetness,
      And they reap a red crop from the field.
    Build barns, ye reapers, garner all aright,
          Though your souls be called to-night
    A cry of tears goes up from blackened homesteads,
      A cry of blood goes up from reeking earth:
    Tears and blood have a cry that pierces Heaven
      Through all its Hallelujah swells of mirth;
    God hears their cry, and though He tarry, yet
          He doth not forget
    Mournful Mother, prone in dust weeping,
      Who shall comfort thee for those who are not?
    As thou didst, men do to thee; and heap the measure,
      And heat the furnace sevenfold hot:
    As thou once, now these to thee--who pitieth thee
          From sea to sea
    O thou King, terrible in strength, and building
      Thy strong future on thy past!
    Though he drink the last, the King of Sheshach,
      Yet he shall drink at the last.
    Art thou greater than great Babylon,
          Which lies overthrown
    Take heed, ye unwise among the people;
      O ye fools, when will ye understand?--
    He that planted the ear shall He not hear,
      Nor He smite who formed the hand?
    "Vengeance is Mine, is Mine," thus saith the Lord:--
          O Man, put up thy sword
      She sitteth still who used to dance,
    She weepeth sore and more and more--
    Let us sit with thee weeping sore,
        O fair France
      She trembleth as the days advance
    Who used to be so light of heart:--
    We in thy trembling bear a part,
        Sister France
      Her eyes shine tearful as they glance:
    "Who shall give back my slaughtered sons?
    "Bind up," she saith, "my wounded ones."--
        Alas, France
      She struggles in a deathly trance,
    As in a dream her pulses stir,
    She hears the nations calling her,
        "France, France, France
      Thou people of the lifted lance,
    Forbear her tears, forbear her blood:
    Roll back, roll back, thy whelming flood,
        Back from France
      Eye not her loveliness askance,
    Forge not for her a galling chain;
    Leave her at peace to bloom again,
        Vine-clad France
      A time there is for change and chance,
    A time for passing of the cup:
    And One abides can yet bind up
        Broken France
      A time there is for change and chance:
    Who next shall drink the trembling cup,
    Wring out its dregs and suck them up
        After France
    Once in a dream (for once I dreamed of you)
      We stood together in an open field;
      Above our heads two swift-winged pigeons wheeled,
    Sporting at ease and courting full in view.
    When loftier still a broadening darkness flew,
      Down-swooping, and a ravenous hawk revealed;
      Too weak to fight, too fond to fly, they yield;
    So farewell life and love and pleasures new.
    Then, as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground,
      Their snow-white plumage flecked with crimson drops,
        I wept, and thought I turned towards you to weep:
      But you were gone; while rustling hedgerow tops
    Bent in a wind which bore to me a sound
        Of far-off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep
        Consider
    The lilies of the field whose bloom is brief:--
        We are as they;
        Like them we fade away,
    As doth a leaf
        Consider
    The sparrows of the air of small account:
        Our God doth view
    Whether they fall or mount,--
        He guards us too
        Consider
    The lilies that do neither spin nor toil,
        Yet are most fair:--
        What profits all this care
    And all this coil
        Consider
    The birds that have no barn nor harvest-weeks;
        God gives them food:--
    Much more our Father seeks
        To do us good
    While roses are so red,
      While lilies are so white,
    Shall a woman exalt her face
      Because it gives delight?
    She's not so sweet as a rose,
      A lily's straighter than she,
    And if she were as red or white
      She'd be but one of three
    Whether she flush in love's summer
      Or in its winter grow pale,
    Whether she flaunt her beauty
      Or hide it away in a veil,
    Be she red or white,
      And stand she erect or bowed,
    Time will win the race he runs with her
      And hide her away in a shroud
    You must not call me Maggie, you must not call me Dear,
      For I'm Lady of the Manor now stately to see;
    And if there comes a babe, as there may some happy year,
      'T will be little lord or lady at my knee
    O, but what ails you, my sailor cousin Phil,
      That you shake and turn white like a cockcrow ghost?
    You're as white as I turned once down by the mill,
      When one told me you and ship and crew were lost
    Philip my playfellow, when we were boy and girl
      (It was the Miller's Nancy told it to me),
    Philip with the merry life in lip and curl,
      Philip my playfellow drowned in the sea
    I thought I should have fainted, but I did not faint;
      I stood stunned at the moment, scarcely sad,
    Till I raised my wail of desolate complaint
      For you, my cousin, brother, all I had
    They said I looked so pale,--some say so fair,--
      My lord stopped in passing to soothe me back to life:
    I know I missed a ringlet from my hair
      Next morning; and now I am his wife
    Look at my gown, Philip, and look at my ring,
      I'm all crimson and gold from top to toe:
    All day long I sit in the sun and sing,
      Where in the sun red roses blush and blow
    And I'm the rose of roses says my lord;
      And to him I'm more than the sun in the sky,
    While I hold him fast with the golden cord
      Of a curl, with the eyelash of an eye
    His mother said "fie," and his sisters cried "shame,"
      His high-born ladies cried "shame" from their place:
    They said "fie" when they only heard my name,
      But fell silent when they saw my face
    Am I so fair, Philip? Philip, did you think
      I was so fair when we played boy and girl,
    Where blue forget-me-nots bloomed on the brink
      Of our stream which the mill-wheel sent awhirl
    If I was fair then sure I'm fairer now,
      Sitting where a score of servants stand,
    With a coronet on high days for my brow
      And almost a sceptre for my hand
    You're but a sailor, Philip, weatherbeaten brown,
      A stranger on land and at home on the sea,
    Coasting as best you may from town to town:
      Coasting along do you often think of me
    I'm a great lady in a sheltered bower,
      With hands grown white through having naught to do:
    Yet sometimes I think of you hour after hour
      Till I nigh wish myself a child with you
    What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through,
    Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do;
    Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all
    What would I give for words, if only words would come;
    But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb:
    O, merry friends, go your way, I have never a word to say
    What would I give for tears, not smiles but scalding tears,
    To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years,
    To wash the stain ingrain and to make me clean again
    Underneath the growing grass,
      Underneath the living flowers,
      Deeper than the sound of showers:
      There we shall not count the hours
    By the shadows as they pass
    Youth and health will be but vain,
      Beauty reckoned of no worth:
      There a very little girth
      Can hold round what once the earth
    Seemed too narrow to contain
    Winter is cold-hearted,
      Spring is yea and nay,
    Autumn is a weathercock
      Blown every way:
    Summer days for me
      When every leaf is on its tree
    When Robin's not a beggar,
      And Jenny Wren's a bride,
    And larks hang singing, singing, singing,
      Over the wheat-fields wide,
      And anchored lilies ride,
    And the pendulum spider
      Swings from side to side
    And blue-black beetles transact business,
      And gnats fly in a host,
    And furry caterpillars hasten
      That no time be lost,
    And moths grow fat and thrive,
    And ladybirds arrive
    Before green apples blush,
      Before green nuts embrown,
    Why, one day in the country
      Is worth a month in town;
      Is worth a day and a year
    Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion
      That days drone elsewhere
    I dwell alone,--I dwell alone, alone,
    Whilst full my river flows down to the sea,
      Gilded with flashing boats
        That bring no friend to me:
    O love-songs, gurgling from a hundred throats,
        O love-pangs, let me be
    Fair fall the freighted boats which gold and stone
        And spices bear to sea:
    Slim, gleaming maidens swell their mellow notes,
        Love-promising, entreating,--
        Ah! sweet, but fleeting,--
      Beneath the shivering, snow-white sails.
      Hush! the wind flags and fails,--
    Hush! they will lie becalmed in sight of strand,--
      Sight of my strand, where I do dwell alone;
    Their songs wake singing echoes in my land,--
      They cannot hear me moan
      One latest, solitary swallow flies
        Across the sea, rough autumn-tempest tost,
        Poor bird, shall it be lost?
      Dropped down into this uncongenial sea,
            With no kind eyes
            To watch it while it dies,
          Unguessed, uncared for, free:
            Set free at last,
            The short pang past,
    In sleep, in death, in dreamless sleep locked fast
    Mine avenue is all a growth of oaks,
          Some rent by thunder-strokes,
    Some rustling leaves and acorns in the breeze:
          Fair fall my fertile trees,
    That rear their goodly heads, and live at ease
    A spider's web blocks all mine avenue;
      He catches down and foolish painted flies,
          That spider wary and wise.
    Each morn it hangs a rainbow strung with dew
      Betwixt boughs green with sap,
      So fair, few creatures guess it is a trap:
          I will not mar the web,
    Though sad I am to see the small lives ebb
    It shakes,--my trees shake; for a wind is roused
          In cavern where it housed:
          Each white and quivering sail,
          Of boats among the water leaves
    Hollows and strains in the full-throated gale:
          Each maiden sings again,--
    Each languid maiden, whom the calm
    Had lulled to sleep with rest and spice and balm,
          Miles down my river to the sea
            They float and wane,
          Long miles away from me.
          Perhaps they say: "She grieves,
            Uplifted, like a beacon, on her tower."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
    More, and we dance among the golden sheaves."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
              More, and we stand,
              Face to face, hand in hand;
    Make haste, O slack gale, to the looked-for land
            My trees are not in flower,
            I have no bower,
            And gusty creaks my tower,
    And lonesome, very lonesome, is my strand
    "There's a footstep coming: look out and see."--
      "The leaves are falling, the wind is calling;
    No one cometh across the lea
    "There's a footstep coming: O sister, look."--
      "The ripple flashes, the white foam dashes;
    No one cometh across the brook
    "But he promised that he would come:
      To-night, to-morrow, in joy or sorrow,
    He must keep his word, and must come home
    "For he promised that he would come:
      His word was given; from earth or heaven,
    He must keep his word, and must come home
    "Go to sleep, my sweet sister Jane;
      You can slumber, who need not number
    Hour after hour, in doubt and pain
    "I shall sit here awhile, and watch;
      Listening, hoping, for one hand groping
    In deep shadow to find the latch
    After the dark, and before the light,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,
    Who had watched and wept the weary night
    After the night, and before the day,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,--
    Watching, weeping for one away
    There came a footstep climbing the stair;
      Some one standing out on the landing
    Shook the door like a puff of air
    Shook the door, and in he passed.
      Did he enter? In the room centre
    Stood her husband: the door shut fast
    "O Robin, but you are cold,--
      Chilled with the night-dew: so lily-white you
    Look like a stray lamb from our fold
    "O Robin, but you are late:
      Come and sit near me,--sit here and cheer me."--
    (Blue the flame burnt in the grate
    "Lay not down your head on my breast:
      I cannot hold you, kind wife, nor fold you
    In the shelter that you love best
    "Feel not after my clasping hand:
      I am but a shadow, come from the meadow
    Where many lie, but no tree can stand
    "We are trees which have shed their leaves:
      Our heads lie low there, but no tears flow there;
    Only I grieve for my wife who grieves
    "I could rest if you would not moan
      Hour after hour; I have no power
    To shut my ears where I lie alone
    "I could rest if you would not cry;
      But there's no sleeping while you sit weeping,--
    Watching, weeping so bitterly
    "Woe's me! woe's me! for this I have heard.
      O, night of sorrow!--O, black to-morrow!
    Is it thus that you keep your word
    "O you who used so to shelter me
      Warm from the least wind,--why, now the east wind
    Is warmer than you, whom I quake to see
    "O my husband of flesh and blood,
      For whom my mother I left, and brother,
    And all I had, accounting it good
    "What do you do there, underground,
      In the dark hollow? I'm fain to follow.
    What do you do there?--what have you found
    "What I do there I must not tell;
      But I have plenty. Kind wife, content ye:
    It is well with us,--it is well
    "Tender hand hath made our nest;
      Our fear is ended, our hope is blended
    With present pleasure, and we have rest
    "O, but Robin, I'm fain to come,
      If your present days are so pleasant;
    For my days are so wearisome
    "Yet I'll dry my tears for your sake:
      Why should I tease you, who cannot please you
    Any more with the pains I take
    I nursed it in my bosom while it lived,
      I hid it in my heart when it was dead;
    In joy I sat alone, even so I grieved
        Alone and nothing said
    I shut the door to face the naked truth,
      I stood alone,--I faced the truth alone,
    Stripped bare of self-regard or forms or ruth
        Till first and last were shown
    I took the perfect balances and weighed;
      No shaking of my hand disturbed the poise;
    Weighed, found it wanting: not a word I said,
        But silent made my choice
    None know the choice I made; I make it still.
      None know the choice I made and broke my heart,
    Breaking mine idol: I have braced my will
        Once, chosen for once my part
    I broke it at a blow, I laid it cold,
      Crushed in my deep heart where it used to live.
    My heart dies inch by inch; the time grows old,
        Grows old in which I grieve
    I have a room whereinto no one enters
      Save I myself alone:
      There sits a blessed memory on a throne,
    There my life centres
    While winter comes and goes--O tedious comer!--
      And while its nip-wind blows;
      While bloom the bloodless lily and warm rose
    Of lavish summer
    If any should force entrance he might see there
      One buried yet not dead,
      Before whose face I no more bow my head
    Or bend my knee there
    But often in my worn life's autumn weather
      I watch there with clear eyes,
      And think how it will be in Paradise
    When we're together
    I, a princess, king-descended, decked with jewels, gilded, drest,
    Would rather be a peasant with her baby at her breast,
    For all I shine so like the sun, and am purple like the west
    Two and two my guards behind, two and two before,
    Two and two on either hand, they guard me evermore;
    Me, poor dove, that must not coo,--eagle, that must not soar
    All my fountains cast up perfumes, all my gardens grow
    Scented woods and foreign spices, with all flowers in blow
    That are costly, out of season as the seasons go
    All my walls are lost in mirrors, whereupon I trace
    Self to right hand, self to left hand, self in every place,
    Self-same solitary figure, self-same seeking face
    Then I have an ivory chair high to sit upon,
    Almost like my father's chair, which is an ivory throne;
    There I sit uplift and upright, there I sit alone
    Alone by day, alone by night, alone days without end;
    My father and my mother give me treasures, search and spend--
    O my father! O my mother! have you ne'er a friend
    As I am a lofty princess, so my father is
    A lofty king, accomplished in all kingly subtilties,
    Holding in his strong right hand world-kingdoms' balances
    He has quarrelled with his neighbors, he has scourged his foes;
    Vassal counts and princes follow where his pennon goes,
    Long-descended valiant lords whom the vulture knows
    On whose track the vulture swoops, when they ride in state
    To break the strength of armies and topple down the great:
    Each of these my courteous servant, none of these my mate
    My father counting up his strength sets down with equal pen
    So many head of cattle, head of horses, head of men;
    These for slaughter, these for labor, with the how and when
    Some to work on roads, canals; some to man his ships;
    Some to smart in mines beneath sharp overseers' whips;
    Some to trap fur-beasts in lands where utmost winter nips
    Once it came into my heart and whelmed me like a flood,
    That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood;
    Men with hearts and men with souls, though trodden down like mud
    Our feasting was not glad that night, our music was not gay;
    On my mother's graceful head I marked a thread of gray,
    My father frowning at the fare seemed every dish to weigh
    I sat beside them sole princess in my exalted place,
    My ladies and my gentlemen stood by me on the dais:
    A mirror showed me I look old and haggard in the face
    It showed me that my ladies all are fair to gaze upon,
    Plump, plenteous-haired, to every one love's secret lore is known,
    They laugh by day, they sleep by night; ah me, what is a throne
    The singing men and women sang that night as usual,
    The dancers danced in pairs and sets, but music had a fall,
    A melancholy windy fall as at a funeral
    Amid the toss of torches to my chamber back we swept;
    My ladies loosed my golden chain; meantime I could have wept
    To think of some in galling chains whether they waked or slept
    I took my bath of scented milk, delicately waited on,
    They burned sweet things for my delight, cedar and cinnamon,
    They lit my shaded silver lamp and left me there alone
    A day went by, a week went by. One day I heard it said:
    "Men are clamoring, women, children, clamoring to be fed;
    Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread
    So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear,
    Vulgar, naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear;
    Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near
    But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark:
    "There are families out grazing like cattle in the park."
    "A pair of peasants must be saved even if we build an ark
    A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way;
    One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day;
    One was my youngest maid, as sweet and white as cream in May
    Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp;
    Voices said: "Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp
    To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp
    "Howl and stamp?" one answered: "They made free to hurl a stone
    At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown."
    "There's work, then, for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown
    "One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head,
    Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread:
    Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead
    "After us the deluge," was retorted with a laugh:
    "If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff."
    "While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff
    These passed. The king: stand up. Said my father with a smile:
    "Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile,
    She's sad to-day, and who but you her sadness can beguile
    He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait
    (I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate),
    Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state
    Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene,
    There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between;
    Or shall she merely fan me while I wait here for the queen
    Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command:
    "Charge!" a clash of steel: "Charge again, the rebels stand.
    Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand
    There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher;
    A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire;
    I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire
    "Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread,
    You who sat to see us starve," one shrieking woman said:
    "Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head
    Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth,
    I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith,
    I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath
    With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand,
    I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand
    Where they curse king, queen, and princess of this cursed land
    They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give;
    I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live;
    I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive
    Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show
    The lesson I have learned, which is death, is life, to know.
    I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go
    Shall I forget on this side of the grave?
    I promise nothing: you must wait and see
          Patient and brave.
    (O my soul, watch with him and he with me
    Shall I forget in peace of Paradise?
    I promise nothing: follow, friend, and see,
          Faithful and wise.
    (O my soul, lead the way he walks with me
    Ah, woe is me for pleasure that is vain,
      Ah, woe is me for glory that is past:
      Pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last,
    Glory that at the last bringeth no gain!
    So saith the sinking heart; and so again
      It shall say till the mighty angel-blast
      Is blown, making the sun and moon aghast,
    And showering down the stars like sudden rain.
    And evermore men shall go fearfully,
      Bending beneath their weight of heaviness;
    And ancient men shall lie down wearily,
      And strong men shall rise up in weariness;
    Yea, even the young shall answer sighingly,
      Saying one to another: How vain it is
    "Whose heart was breaking for a little love
    Down-stairs I laugh, I sport and jest with all:
      But in my solitary room above
    I turn my face in silence to the wall;
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        Though winter frosts are done,
        And birds pair every one,
    And leaves peep out, for springtide is begun
    I feel no spring, while spring is wellnigh blown,
      I find no nest, while nests are in the grove:
    Woe's me for mine own heart that dwells alone,
      My heart that breaketh for a little love.
        While golden in the sun
        Rivulets rise and run,
    While lilies bud, for springtide is begun
    All love, are loved, save only I; their hearts
      Beat warm with love and joy, beat full thereof:
    They cannot guess, who play the pleasant parts,
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While beehives wake and whirr,
        And rabbit thins his fur,
    In living spring that sets the world astir
    I deck myself with silks and jewelry,
      I plume myself like any mated dove:
    They praise my rustling show, and never see
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While sprouts green lavender
        With rosemary and myrrh,
    For in quick spring the sap is all astir
    Perhaps some saints in glory guess the truth,
      Perhaps some angels read it as they move,
    And cry one to another full of ruth,
        "Her heart is breaking for a little love."
          Though other things have birth,
          And leap and sing for mirth,
    When spring-time wakes and clothes and feeds the earth
    Yet saith a saint: "Take patience for thy scathe";
      Yet saith an angel: "Wait, for thou shalt prove
    True best is last, true life is born of death,
      O thou, heart-broken for a little love!
        Then love shall fill thy girth,
        And love make fat thy dearth,
    When new spring builds new heaven and clean new earth
    Life is not sweet. One day it will be sweet
        To shut our eyes and die:
    Nor feel the wild-flowers blow, nor birds dart by
        With flitting butterfly,
    Nor grass grow long above our heads and feet,
    Nor hear the happy lark that soars sky high,
    Nor sigh that spring is fleet and summer fleet,
        Nor mark the waxing wheat,
    Nor know who sits in our accustomed seat
    Life is not good. One day it will be good
        To die, then live again;
    To sleep meanwhile: so not to feel the wane
    Of shrunk leaves dropping in the wood,
    Nor hear the foamy lashing of the main,
    Nor mark the blackened bean-fields, nor where stood
        Rich ranks of golden grain,
    Only dead refuse stubble clothe the plain:
    Asleep from risk, asleep from pain
    Did any bird come flying
      After Adam and Eve,
    When the door was shut against them
      And they sat down to grieve
    I think not Eve's peacock
      Splendid to see,
    And I think not Adam's eagle;
      But a dove may be
    Did any beast come pushing
      Through the thorny hedge
    Into the thorny, thistly world
      Out from Eden's edge
    I think not a lion,
      Though his strength is such;
    But an innocent loving lamb
      May have done as much
    If the dove preached from her bough
      And the lamb from his sod,
    The lamb and the dove
      Were preachers sent from God
    "While I sit at the door,
    Sick to gaze within,
    Mine eye weepeth sore
    For sorrow and sin:
    As a tree my sin stands
    To darken all lands;
    Death is the fruit it bore
    "How have Eden bowers grown
    Without Adam to bend them!
    How have Eden flowers blown,
    Squandering their sweet breath,
    Without me to tend them!
    The Tree of Life was ours,
    Tree twelvefold-fruited,
    Most lofty tree that flowers,
    Most deeply rooted:
    I chose the Tree of Death
    "Hadst thou but said me nay,
    Adam, my brother,
    I might have pined away;
    I, but none other:
    God might have let thee stay
    Safe in our garden,
    By putting me away
    Beyond all pardon
    "I, Eve, sad mother
    Of all who must live,
    I, not another,
    Plucked bitterest fruit to give
    My friend, husband, lover.
    O wanton eyes run over!
    Who but I should grieve?--
    Cain hath slain his brother:
    Of all who must die mother,
    Miserable Eve
    Thus she sat weeping,
    Thus Eve, our mother,
    Where one lay sleeping
    Slain by his brother.
    Greatest and least
    Each piteous beast
    To hear her voice
    Forgot his joys
    And set aside his feast
    The mouse paused in his walk
    And dropped his wheaten stalk;
    Grave cattle wagged their heads
    In rumination;
    The eagle gave a cry
    From his cloud station;
    Larks on thyme beds
    Forbore to mount or sing;
    Bees drooped upon the wing;
    The raven perched on high
    Forgot his ration;
    The conies in their rock,
    A feeble nation,
    Quaked sympathetical;
    The mocking-bird left off to mock;
    Huge camels knelt as if
    In deprecation;
    The kind hart's tears were falling;
    Chattered the wistful stork;
    Dove-voices with a dying fall
    Cooed desolation,
    Answering grief by grief
    Only the serpent in the dust,
    Wriggling and crawling,
    Grinned an evil grin, and thrust
    His tongue out with its fork
    I loved my love from green of Spring
      Until sere Autumn's fall;
    But now that leaves are withering
      How should one love at all?
      One heart's too small
    For hunger, cold, love, everything
    I loved my love on sunny days
      Until late Summer's wane;
    But now that frost begins to glaze
      How should one love again?
      Nay, love and pain
    Walk wide apart in diverse ways
    I loved my love,--alas to see
      That this should be, alas!
    I thought that this could scarcely be,
      Yet has it come to pass:
      Sweet sweet love was,
    Now bitter bitter grown to me
    The year stood at its equinox
      And bluff the North was blowing,
    A bleat of lambs came from the flocks,
      Green hardy things were growing;
    I met a maid with shining locks
      Where milky kine were lowing
    She wore a kerchief on her neck,
      Her bare arm showed its dimple,
    Her apron spread without a speck,
      Her air was frank and simple
    She milked into a wooden pail
      And sang a country ditty,
    An innocent fond lovers' tale,
      That was not wise nor witty,
    Pathetically rustical,
      Too pointless for the city
    She kept in time without a beat
      As true as church-bell ringers,
    Unless she tapped time with her feet,
      Or squeezed it with her fingers;
    Her clear unstudied notes were sweet
      As many a practised singer's
    I stood a minute out of sight,
      Stood silent for a minute
    To eye the pail, and creamy white
      The frothing milk within it
    To eye the comely milking maid
      Herself so fresh and creamy:
    "Good day to you," at last I said;
      She turned her head to see me:
    "Good day," she said, with lifted head;
      Her eyes looked soft and dreamy
    And all the while she milked and milked
      The grave cow heavy-laden:
    I've seen grand ladies plumed and silked,
      But not a sweeter maiden
    But not a sweeter, fresher maid
      Than this in homely cotton,
    Whose pleasant face and silky braid
      I have not yet forgotten
    Seven springs have passed since then, as I
      Count with a sober sorrow;
    Seven springs have come and passed me by,
      And spring sets in to-morrow
    I've half a mind to shake myself
      Free just for once from London,
    To set my work upon the shelf
      And leave it done or undone
    To run down by the early train,
      Whirl down with shriek and whistle,
    And feel the bluff North blow again,
      And mark the sprouting thistle
    Set up on waste patch of the lane
      Its green and tender bristle
    And spy the scarce-blown violet banks,
      Crisp primrose leaves and others,
    And watch the lambs leap at their pranks
      And butt their patient mothers
    Alas, one point in all my plan
      My serious thoughts demur to:
    Seven years have passed for maid and man,
      Seven years have passed for her too
    Perhaps my rose is overblown,
      Not rosy or too rosy;
    Perhaps in farm-house of her own
      Some husband keeps her cosey,
    Where I should show a face unknown.
      Good by, my wayside posy
    Somewhere or other there must surely be
      The face not seen, the voice not heard,
    The heart that not yet--never yet--ah me!
        Made answer to my word
    Somewhere or other, may be near or far;
      Past land and sea, clean out of sight;
    Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star
        That tracks her night by night
    Somewhere or other, may be far or near;
      With just a wall, a hedge, between;
    With just the last leaves of the dying year
        Fallen on a turf grown green
      What can lambkins do
      All the keen night through?
    Nestle by their woolly mother,
      The careful ewe
      What can nestlings do
      In the nightly dew?
    Sleep beneath their mother's wing
      Till day breaks anew
      If in field or tree
      There might only be
    Such a warm soft sleeping-place
      Found for me
    I WISH you were a pleasant wren,
      And I your small accepted mate;
    How we'd look down on toilsome men!
      We'd rise and go to bed at eight
      Or it may be not quite so late
    Then you should see the nest I'd build,
      The wondrous nest for you and me;
    The outside rough, perhaps, but filled
      With wool and down: ah, you should see
      The cosey nest that it would be
    We'd have our change of hope and fear,
      Small quarrels, reconcilements sweet:
    I'd perch by you to chirp and cheer,
      Or hop about on active feet
      And fetch you dainty bits to eat
    We'd be so happy by the day,
      So safe and happy through the night,
    We both should feel, and I should say,
      It's all one season of delight,
    And we'll make merry whilst we may
    Perhaps some day there'd be an egg
      When spring had blossomed from the snow:
    I'd stand triumphant on one leg;
      Like chanticleer I'd almost crow
      To let our little neighbors know
    Next you should sit and I would sing
    Through lengthening days of sunny spring:
      Till, if you wearied of the task,
    I'd sit; and you should spread your wing
      From bough to bough; I'd sit and bask
    Fancy the breaking of the shell,
      The chirp, the chickens wet and bare,
    The untried proud paternal swell;
      And you with housewife-matron air
      Enacting choicer bills of fare
    Fancy the embryo coats of down,
      The gradual feathers soft and sleek;
    Till clothed and strong from tail to crown,
      With virgin warblings in their beak,
      They too go forth to soar and seek
    So would it last an April through
    And early summer fresh with dew:
      Then should we part and live as twain,
    Love-time would bring me back to you
      And build our happy nest again
    O happy rose-bud blooming
      Upon thy parent tree,--
    Nay, thou art too presuming;
    For soon the earth entombing
      Thy faded charms shall be,
    And the chill damp consuming
    O happy skylark springing
      Up to the broad blue sky,
    Too fearless in thy winging,
    Too gladsome in thy singing,
      Thou also soon shalt lie
    Where no sweet notes are ringing
    And through life's shine and shower
      We shall have joy and pain;
    But in the summer bower,
    And at the morning hour,
      We still shall look in vain
    For the same bird and flower
    "The iniquity of the fathers upon the children
    O the rose of keenest thorn!
    One hidden summer morn
    Under the rose I was born
    I do not guess his name
    Who wrought my Mother's shame,
    And gave me life forlorn,
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    I know her from all other.
    My Mother pale and mild,
    Fair as ever was seen,
    She was but scarce sixteen,
    Little more than a child,
    When I was born
    To work her scorn.
    With secret bitter throes,
    In a passion of secret woes,
    She bore me under the rose
    One who my Mother nursed
    Took me from the first:--
    "O nurse, let me look upon
    This babe that cost so dear;
    To-morrow she will be gone:
    Other mothers may keep
    Their babes awake and asleep,
    But I must not keep her here."--
    Whether I know or guess,
    I know this not the less
    So I was sent away
    That none might spy the truth:
    And my childhood waxed to youth
    And I left off childish play.
    I never cared to play
    With the village boys and girls;
    And I think they thought me proud,
    I found so little to say
    And kept so from the crowd:
    But I had the longest curls,
    And I had the largest eyes,
    And my teeth were small like pearls;
    The girls might flout and scout me,
    But the boys would hang about me
    In sheepish mooning wise
    Our one-street village stood
    A long mile from the town,
    A mile of windy down
    And bleak one-sided wood,
    With not a single house.
    Our town itself was small,
    With just the common shops,
    And throve in its small way.
    Our neighboring gentry reared
    The good old-fashioned crops,
    And made old-fashioned boasts
    Of what John Bull would do
    If Frenchman Frog appeared,
    And drank old-fashioned toasts,
    And made old-fashioned bows
    To my Lady at the Hall
    My Lady at the Hall
    Is grander than they all:
    Hers is the oldest name
    In all the neighborhood;
    But the race must die with her
    Though she's a lofty dame,
    For she's unmarried still.
    Poor people say she's good
    And has an open hand
    As any in the land,
    And she's the comforter
    Of many sick and sad;
    My nurse once said to me
    That everything she had
    Came of my Lady's bounty:
    "Though she's greatest in the county
    She's humble to the poor,
    No beggar seeks her door
    But finds help presently.
    I pray both night and day
    For her, and you must pray:
    But she'll never feel distress
    If needy folk can bless."
    I was a little maid
    When here we came to live
    From somewhere by the sea.
    Men spoke a foreign tongue
    There where we used to be
    When I was merry and young,
    Too young to feel afraid;
    The fisher-folk would give
    A kind strange word to me,
    There by the foreign sea:
    I don't know where it was,
    But I remember still
    Our cottage on a hill,
    And fields of flowering grass
    On that fair foreign shore
    I liked my old home best,
    But this was pleasant too:
    So here we made our nest
    And here I grew.
    And now and then my Lady
    In riding past our door
    Would nod to nurse and speak,
    Or stoop and pat my cheek;
    And I was always ready
    To hold the field-gate wide
    For my Lady to go through;
    My Lady in her veil
    So seldom put aside,
    My Lady grave and pale
    I often sat to wonder
    Who might my parents be,
    For I knew of something under
    My simple-seeming state.
    Nurse never talked to me
    Of mother or of father,
    But watched me early and late
    With kind suspicious cares:
    Or not suspicious, rather
    Anxious, as if she knew
    Some secret I might gather
    And smart for unawares.
    Thus I grew
    But Nurse waxed old and gray,
    Bent and weak with years.
    There came a certain day
    That she lay upon her bed
    Shaking her palsied head,
    With words she gasped to say
    Which had to stay unsaid.
    Then with a jerking hand
    Held out so piteously
    She gave a ring to me
    Of gold wrought curiously,
    A ring which she had worn
    Since the day that I was born,
    She once had said to me:
    I slipped it on my finger;
    Her eyes were keen to linger
    On my hand that slipped it on;
    Then she sighed one rattling sigh
    And stared on with sightless eye:--
    The one who loved me was gone
    How long I stayed alone
    With the corpse I never knew,
    For I fainted dead as stone:
    When I came to life once more
    I was down upon the floor,
    With neighbors making ado
    To bring me back to life.
    I heard the sexton's wife
    Say: "Up, my lad, and run
    To tell it at the Hall;
    She was my Lady's nurse,
    And done can't be undone.
    I'll watch by this poor lamb.
    I guess my Lady's purse
    Is always open to such:
    I'd run up on my crutch
    A cripple as I am,"
    (For cramps had vexed her much,)
    "Rather than this dear heart
    Lack one to take her part
    For days, day after day,
    On my weary bed I lay,
    Wishing the time would pass;
    O, so wishing that I was
    Likely to pass away:
    For the one friend whom I knew
    Was dead, I knew no other,
    Neither father nor mother;
    And I, what should I do
    One day the sexton's wife
    Said: "Rouse yourself, my dear:
    My Lady has driven down
    From the Hall into the town,
    And we think she's coming here.
    Cheer up, for life is life
    But I would not look or speak,
    Would not cheer up at all.
    My tears were like to fall,
    So I turned round to the wall
    And hid my hollow cheek,
    Making as if I slept,
    As silent as a stone,
    And no one knew I wept.
    What was my Lady to me,
    The grand lady from the Hall?
    She might come, or stay away,
    I was sick at heart that day:
    The whole world seemed to be
    Nothing, just nothing to me,
    For aught that I could see
    Yet I listened where I lay:
    A bustle came below,
    A clear voice said: "I know;
    I will see her first alone,
    It may be less of a shock
    If she's so weak to-day":--
    A light hand turned the lock,
    A light step crossed the floor,
    One sat beside my bed:
    But never a word she said
    For me, my shyness grew
    Each moment more and more:
    So I said never a word
    And neither looked nor stirred;
    I think she must have heard
    My heart go pit-a-pat:
    Thus I lay, my Lady sat,
    More than a mortal hour
    (I counted one and two
    By the house-clock while I lay):
    I seemed to have no power
    To think of a thing to say,
    Or do what I ought to do,
    Or rouse myself to a choice
    At last she said: "Margaret,
    Won't you even look at me?"
    A something in her voice
    Forced my tears to fall at last,
    Forced sobs from me thick and fast;
    Something not of the past,
    Yet stirring memory;
    A something new, and yet
    Not new, too sweet to last,
    Which I never can forget
    I turned and stared at her:
    Her cheek showed hollow-pale;
    Her hair like mine was fair,
    A wonderful fall of hair
    That screened her like a veil;
    But her height was statelier,
    Her eyes had depth more deep:
    I think they must have had
    Always a something sad,
    Unless they were asleep
    While I stared, my Lady took
    My hand in her spare hand,
    Jewelled and soft and grand,
    And looked with a long long look
    Of hunger in my face;
    As if she tried to trace
    Features she ought to know,
    And half hoped, half feared, to find.
    Whatever was in her mind
    She heaved a sigh at last,
    And began to talk to me.
    "Your nurse was my dear nurse,
    And her nursling's dear," said she:
    "No one told me a word
    Of her getting worse and worse,
    Till her poor life was past"
    (Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):
    "I might have been with her,
    I might have promised and heard,
    But she had no comforter.
    She might have told me much
    Which now I shall never know,
    Never, never shall know."
    She sat by me sobbing so,
    And seemed so woe-begone,
    That I laid one hand upon
    Hers with a timid touch,
    Scarce thinking what I did,
    Not knowing what to say:
    That moment her face was hid
    In the pillow close by mine,
    Her arm was flung over me,
    She hugged me, sobbing so
    As if her heart would break,
    And kissed me where I lay
    After this she often came
    To bring me fruit or wine,
    Or sometimes hothouse flowers.
    And at nights I lay awake
    Often and often thinking
    What to do for her sake.
    Wet or dry it was the same:
    She would come in at all hours,
    Set me eating and drinking,
    And say I must grow strong;
    At last the day seemed long
    And home seemed scarcely home
    If she did not come
    Well, I grew strong again:
    In time of primroses
    I went to pluck them in the lane;
    In time of nestling birds
    I heard them chirping round the house;
    And all the herds
    Were out at grass when I grew strong,
    And days were waxen long,
    And there was work for bees
    Among the May-bush boughs,
    And I had shot up tall,
    And life felt after all
    Pleasant, and not so long
    When I grew strong
    I was going to the Hall
    To be my Lady's maid:
    "Her little friend," she said to me,
    "Almost her child,"
    She said and smiled,
    Sighing painfully;
    Blushing, with a second flush,
    As if she blushed to blush
    Friend, servant, child: just this
    My standing at the Hall;
    The other servants call me "Miss,"
    My Lady calls me "Margaret,"
    With her clear voice musical.
    She never chides when I forget
    This or that; she never chides.
    Except when people come to stay
    (And that's not often) at the Hall,
    I sit with her all day
    And ride out when she rides.
    She sings to me and makes me sing;
    Sometimes I read to her,
    Sometimes we merely sit and talk.
    She noticed once my ring
    And made me tell its history:
    That evening in our garden walk
    She said she should infer
    The ring had been my father's first,
    Then my mother's, given for me
    To the nurse who nursed
    My mother in her misery,
    That so quite certainly
    Some one might know me, who--
    Then she was silent, and I too
    I hate when people come:
    The women speak and stare
    And mean to be so civil.
    This one will stroke my hair,
    That one will pat my cheek
    And praise my Lady's kindness,
    Expecting me to speak;
    I like the proud ones best
    Who sit as struck with blindness,
    As if I wasn't there.
    But if any gentleman
    Is staying at the Hall
    (Though few come prying here),
    My Lady seems to fear
    Some downright dreadful evil,
    And makes me keep my room
    As closely as she can:
    So I hate when people come,
    It is so troublesome.
    In spite of all her care,
    Sometimes to keep alive
    I sometimes do contrive
    To get out in the grounds
    For a whiff of wholesome air,
    Under the rose you know:
    It's charming to break bounds,
    Stolen waters are sweet,
    And what's the good of feet
    If for days they mustn't go?
    Give me a longer tether,
    Or I may break from it
    Now I have eyes and ears
    And just some little wit:
    "Almost my lady's child";
    I recollect she smiled,
    Sighed and blushed together;
    Then her story of the ring
    Sounds not improbable,
    She told it me so well
    It seemed the actual thing:--
    O keep your counsel close,
    But I guess under the rose,
    In long past summer weather
    When the world was blossoming,
    And the rose upon its thorn:
    I guess not who he was
    Flawed honor like a glass
    And made my life forlorn;
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    O, I know her from all other
    My Lady, you might trust
    Your daughter with your fame.
    Trust me, I would not shame
    Our honorable name,
    For I have noble blood
    Though I was bred in dust
    And brought up in the mud.
    I will not press my claim,
    Just leave me where you will:
    But you might trust your daughter,
    For blood is thicker than water
    And you're my mother still
    So my Lady holds her own
    With condescending grace,
    And fills her lofty place
    With an untroubled face
    As a queen may fill a throne.
    While I could hint a tale
    (But then I am her child)
    Would make her quail;
    Would set her in the dust,
    Lorn with no comforter,
    Her glorious hair defiled
    And ashes on her cheek:
    The decent world would thrust
    Its finger out at her,
    Not much displeased I think
    To make a nine days' stir;
    The decent world would sink
    Its voice to speak of her
    Now this is what I mean
    To do, no more, no less:
    Never to speak, or show
    Bare sign of what I know.
    Let the blot pass unseen;
    Yea, let her never guess
    I hold the tangled clew
    She huddles out of view.
    Friend, servant, almost child,
    So be it and nothing more
    On this side of the grave.
    Mother, in Paradise,
    You'll see with clearer eyes;
    Perhaps in this world even
    When you are like to die
    And face to face with Heaven
    You'll drop for once the lie:
    But you must drop the mask, not
    My Lady promises
    Two hundred pounds with me
    Whenever I may wed
    A man she can approve:
    And since besides her bounty
    I'm fairest in the county
    (For so I've heard it said,
    Though I don't vouch for this),
    Her promised pounds may move
    Some honest man to see
    My virtues and my beauties;
    Perhaps the rising grazier,
    Or temperance publican,
    May claim my wifely duties.
    Meanwhile I wait their leisure
    And grace-bestowing pleasure,
    I wait the happy man;
    But if I hold my head
    And pitch my expectations
    Just higher than their level,
    They must fall back on patience:
    I may not mean to wed,
    Yet I'll be civil
    Now sometimes in a dream
    My heart goes out of me
    To build and scheme,
    Till I sob after things that seem
    So pleasant in a dream:
    A home such as I see
    My blessed neighbors live in
    With father and with mother,
    All proud of one another,
    Named by one common name,
    From baby in the bud
    To full-blown workman father;
    It's little short of Heaven.
    I'd give my gentle blood
    To wash my special shame
    And drown my private grudge;
    I'd toil and moil much rather
    The dingiest cottage drudge
    Whose mother need not blush,
    Than live here like a lady
    And see my Mother flush
    And hear her voice unsteady
    Sometimes, yet never dare
    Ask to share her care
    Of course the servants sneer
    Behind my back at me;
    Of course the village girls,
    Who envy me my curls
    And gowns and idleness,
    Take comfort in a jeer;
    Of course the ladies guess
    Just so much of my history
    As points the emphatic stress
    With which they laud my Lady;
    The gentlemen who catch
    A casual glimpse of me
    And turn again to see,
    Their valets on the watch
    To speak a word with me,
    All know and sting me wild;
    Till I am almost ready
    To wish that I were dead,
    No faces more to see,
    No more words to be said,
    My Mother safe at last
    Disburdened of her child,
    And the past past
    "All equal before God,"--
    Our Rector has it so,
    And sundry sleepers nod:
    It may be so; I know
    All are not equal here,
    And when the sleepers wake
    They make a difference.
    "All equal in the grave,"--
    That shows an obvious sense:
    Yet something which I crave
    Not death itself brings near;
    How should death half atone
    For all my past; or make
    The name I bear my own
    I love my dear old Nurse
    Who loved me without gains;
    I love my mistress even,
    Friend, Mother, what you will:
    But I could almost curse
    My Father for his pains;
    And sometimes at my prayer,
    Kneeling in sight of Heaven,
    I almost curse him still:
    Why did he set his snare
    To catch at unaware
    My Mother's foolish youth;
    Load me with shame that's hers,
    And her with something worse,
    A lifelong lie for truth
    I think my mind is fixed
    On one point and made up:
    To accept my lot unmixed;
    Never to drug the cup
    But drink it by myself.
    I'll not be wooed for pelf;
    I'll not blot out my shame
    With any man's good name;
    But nameless as I stand,
    My hand is my own hand,
    And nameless as I came
    I go to the dark land
    "All equal in the grave,"--
    I bide my time till then:
    "All equal before God,"--
    To-day I feel His rod,
    To-morrow He may save:
                Amen
    Oh what comes over the sea,
      Shoals and quicksands past;
    And what comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast
    A wind comes over the sea
      With a moan in its blast;
    But nothing comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast
    Let me be, let me be,
      For my lot is cast:
    Land or sea all's one to me,
      And sail it slow or fast
    Why does the sea moan evermore?
      Shut out from heaven it makes its moan.
    It frets against the boundary shore;
      All earth's full rivers cannot fill
      The sea, that drinking thirsteth still
    Sheer miracles of loveliness
      Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed:
    Anemones, salt, passionless,
      Blow flower-like; just enough alive
      To blow and multiply and thrive
    Shells quaint with curve, or spot, or spike,
      Encrusted live things argus-eyed,
    All fair alike, yet all unlike,
      Are born without a pang, and die
      Without a pang,--and so pass by
      A dream that waketh,
      Bubble that breaketh,
    Song whose burden sigheth,
      A passing breath,
      Smoke that vanisheth,--
    Such is life that dieth
      A flower that fadeth,
      Fruit the tree sheddeth,
    Trackless bird that flieth,
      Summer time brief,
      Falling of the leaf,--
    Such is life that dieth
      A scent exhaling,
      Snow waters failing,
    Morning dew that drieth,
      A windy blast,
      Lengthening shadows cast,--
    Such is life that dieth
      A scanty measure,
      Rust-eaten treasure,
    Spending that nought buyeth,
      Moth on the wing,
      Toil unprofiting,--
    Such is life that dieth
      Morrow by morrow
      Sorrow breeds sorrow,
    For this my song sigheth;
      From day to night
      We lapse out of sight,--
    Such is life that dieth
    She came among us from the South
      And made the North her home awhile
      Our dimness brightened in her smile,
    Our tongue grew sweeter in her mouth
    We chilled beside her liberal glow,
      She dwarfed us by her ampler scale,
      Her full-blown blossom made us pale,
    She summer-like and we like snow
    We Englishwomen, trim, correct,
      All minted in the self-same mould,
      Warm-hearted but of semblance cold,
    All-courteous out of self-respect
    She woman in her natural grace,
      Less trammelled she by lore of school,
      Courteous by nature not by rule,
    Warm-hearted and of cordial face
    So for awhile she made her home
      Among us in the rigid North,
      She who from Italy came forth
    And scaled the Alps and crossed the foam
    But if she found us like our sea,
      Of aspect colourless and chill,
      Rock-girt; like it she found us still
    Deep at our deepest, strong and free
    (Margaret
    I said: This is a beautiful fresh rose.
      I said: I will delight me with its scent,
      Will watch its lovely curve of languishment,
    Will watch its leaves unclose, its heart unclose.
    I said: Old Earth has put away her snows,
      All living things make merry to their bent,
      A flower is come for every flower that went
    In autumn; the sun glows, the south wind blows.
    So walking in a garden of delight
      I came upon one sheltered shadowed nook
    Where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night,
      And there lay snow unmelted by the sun:--
    I answered: Take who will the path I took,
      Winter nips once for all; love is but one
    Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring:
      Or if these bloom when worn-out autumn grieves,
      Let them lie hid in double shade of leaves,
    Their own, and others dropped down withering;
    For violets suit when home birds build and sing,
      Not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves;
      Not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves,
    But when the green world buds to blossoming.
    Keep violets for the spring, and love for youth,
      Love that should dwell with beauty, mirth, and hope:
        Or if a later sadder love be born,
      Let this not look for grace beyond its scope,
    But give itself, nor plead for answering truth--
        A grateful Ruth tho' gleaning scanty corn
    I would not if I could undo my past,
      Tho' for its sake my future is a blank;
      My past for which I have myself to thank,
    For all its faults and follies first and last.
    I would not cast anew the lot once cast,
      Or launch a second ship for one that sank,
      Or drug with sweets the bitterness I drank,
    Or break by feasting my perpetual fast.
    I would not if I could: for much more dear
      Is one remembrance than a hundred joys,
        More than a thousand hopes in jubilee;
      Dearer the music of one tearful voice
        That unforgotten calls and calls to me,
    "Follow me here, rise up, and follow here
    What seekest thou, far in the unknown land?
      In hope I follow joy gone on before;
      In hope and fear persistent more and more,
    As the dry desert lengthens out its sand.
    Whilst day and night I carry in my hand
      The golden key to ope the golden door
      Of golden home; yet mine eye weepeth sore,
    For long the journey is that makes no stand.
    And who is this that veiled doth walk with thee?
      Lo, this is Love that walketh at my right;
        One exile holds us both, and we are bound
      To selfsame home-joys in the land of light.
    Weeping thou walkest with him; weepeth he?--
        Some sobbing weep, some weep and make no sound
    A dimness of a glory glimmers here
      Thro' veils and distance from the space remote,
      A faintest far vibration of a note
    Reaches to us and seems to bring us near;
    Causing our face to glow with braver cheer,
      Making the serried mist to stand afloat,
      Subduing languor with an antidote,
    And strengthening love almost to cast out fear:
    Till for one moment golden city walls
      Rise looming on us, golden walls of home,
    Light of our eyes until the darkness falls;
      Then thro' the outer darkness burdensome
    I hear again the tender voice that calls,
      "Follow me hither, follow, rise, and come
    "And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest
    The earth was green, the sky was blue:
      I saw and heard one sunny morn
    A skylark hang between the two,
      A singing speck above the corn
    A stage below, in gay accord,
      White butterflies danced on the wing,
    And still the singing skylark soared
      And silent sank, and soared to sing
    The cornfield stretched a tender green
      To right and left beside my walks;
    I knew he had a nest unseen
      Somewhere among the million stalks
    And as I paused to hear his song
      While swift the sunny moments slid,
    Perhaps his mate sat listening long,
      And listened longer than I did
    Through the vales to my love!
      To the happy small nest of home
    Green from basement to roof;
      Where the honey-bees come
    To the window-sill flowers,
      And dive from above,
    Safe from the spider that weaves
      Her warp and her woof
    In some outermost leaves
    Through the vales to my love!
      In sweet April hours
      All rainbows and showers,
    While dove answers dove,--
      In beautiful May,
    When the orchards are tender
      And frothing with flowers,--
      In opulent June,
    When the wheat stands up slender
      By sweet-smelling hay,
    And half the sun's splendour
      Descends to the moon
    Through the vales to my love!
      Where the turf is so soft to the feet,
      And the thyme makes it sweet,
    And the stately foxglove
      Hangs silent its exquisite bells;
      And where water wells
    The greenness grows greener,
      And bulrushes stand
    Round a lily to screen her
    Nevertheless, if this land,
      Like a garden to smell and to sight,
    Were turned to a desert of sand,
      Stripped bare of delight,
      All its best gone to worst,
    For my feet no repose,
      No water to comfort my thirst,
    And heaven like a furnace above,--
      The desert would be
      As gushing of waters to me,
    The wilderness be as a rose,
      If it led me to thee,
      O my love
    Like flowers sequestered from the sun
      And wind of summer, day by day
    I dwindled paler, whilst my hair
        Showed the first tinge of grey
    "Oh, what is life, that we should live?
      Or what is death, that we must die?
    A bursting bubble is our life:
        I also, what am
    "What is your grief? now tell me, sweet,
      That I may grieve," my sister said;
    And stayed a white embroidering hand
        And raised a golden head
    Her tresses showed a richer mass,
      Her eyes looked softer than my own,
    Her figure had a statelier height,
        Her voice a tenderer tone
    "Some must be second and not first;
      All cannot be the first of all:
    Is not this, too, but vanity?
      I stumble like to fall
    "So yesterday I read the acts
      Of Hector and each clangorous king
    With wrathful great Æacides:--
        Old Homer leaves a sting
    The comely face looked up again,
      The deft hand lingered on the thread
    "Sweet, tell me what is Homer's sting,
        Old Homer's sting?" she said
    "He stirs my sluggish pulse like wine,
      He melts me like the wind of spice,
    Strong as strong Ajax' red right hand,
        And grand like Juno's eyes
    "I cannot melt the sons of men,
      I cannot fire and tempest-toss:--
    Besides, those days were golden days,
        Whilst these are days of dross
    She laughed a feminine low laugh,
      Yet did not stay her dexterous hand:
    "Now tell me of those days," she said,
        "When time ran golden sand
    "Then men were men of might and right,
      Sheer might, at least, and weighty swords;
    Then men in open blood and fire
        Bore witness to their words
    "Crest-rearing kings with whistling spears;
      But if these shivered in the shock
    They wrenched up hundred-rooted trees,
        Or hurled the effacing rock
    "Then hand to hand, then foot to foot,
      Stern to the death-grip grappling then,
    Who ever thought of gunpowder
        Amongst these men of men
    "They knew whose hand struck home the death,
      They knew who broke but would not bend,
    Could venerate an equal foe
        And scorn a laggard friend
    "Calm in the utmost stress of doom,
      Devout toward adverse powers above,
    They hated with intenser hate
        And loved with fuller love
    "Then heavenly beauty could allay
      As heavenly beauty stirred the strife:
    By them a slave was worshipped more
        Than is by us a wife
    She laughed again, my sister laughed;
      Made answer o'er the laboured cloth:
    "I rather would be one of us
        Than wife, or slave, or both
    "Oh better then be slave or wife
      Than fritter now blank life away:
    Then night had holiness of night,
        And day was sacred day
    "The princess laboured at her loom,
      Mistress and handmaiden alike;
    Beneath their needles grew the field
        With warriors armed to strike
    "Or, look again, dim Dian's face
      Gleamed perfect through the attendant night:
    Were such not better than those holes
        Amid that waste of white
    "A shame it is, our aimless life;
      I rather from my heart would feed
    From silver dish in gilded stall
        With wheat and wine the steed
    "The faithful steed that bore my lord
      In safety through the hostile land,
    The faithful steed that arched his neck
        To fondle with my hand
    Her needle erred; a moment's pause,
      A moment's patience, all was well.
    Then she: "But just suppose the horse,
        Suppose the rider fell
    "Then captive in an alien house,
      Hungering on exile's bitter bread,--
    They happy, they who won the lot
        Of sacrifice," she said
    Speaking she faltered, while her look
      Showed forth her passion like a glass:
    With hand suspended, kindling eye,
        Flushed cheek, how fair she was
    "Ah well, be those the days of dross;
      This, if you will, the age of gold:
    Yet had those days a spark of warmth,
        While these are somewhat cold
    "Are somewhat mean and cold and slow,
      Are stunted from heroic growth:
    We gain but little when we prove
        The worthlessness of both
    "But life is in our hands," she said;
      "In our own hands for gain or loss:
    Shall not the Sevenfold Sacred Fire
        Suffice to purge our dross
    "Too short a century of dreams,
      One day of work sufficient length:
    Why should not you, why should not I,
        Attain heroic strength
    "Our life is given us as a blank,
      Ourselves must make it blest or curst:

        In one of Diomed

      Through life, through death, enlarge their span

    "He offered vengeance, lifelong grief
      To one dear ghost, uncounted price:

      And I was whitening with the jeer;
    She rose: "I went too far," she said;
        Spoke low: "Forgive me, dear

      Her almost tearful eyes, her cheek
    Grown pale, confessed the strength of love
        Which only made her speak
    For mild she was, of few soft words,
      Most gentle, easy to be led,
    Content to listen when I spoke,
        And reverence what I said
    I elder sister by six years;
      Not half so glad, or wise, or good:
    Her words rebuked my secret self
        And shamed me where I stood
    She never guessed her words reproved
      A silent envy nursed within,
    A selfish, souring discontent
        Pride-born, the devil's sin
    I smiled, half bitter, half in jest:
      "The wisest man of all the wise
    Left for his summary of life
        'Vanity of vanities
    "Beneath the sun there's nothing new:
      Men flow, men ebb, mankind flows on:
    If I am wearied of my life,
        Why, so was Solomon
    "Vanity of vanities he preached
      Of all he found, of all he sought:
    Vanity of vanities, the gist
        Of all the words he taught
    "This in the wisdom of the world,
      In Homer's page, in all, we find:
    As the sea is not filled, so yearns
        Man's universal mind
    "This Homer felt, who gave his men
      With glory but a transient state:
    His very Jove could not reverse
        Irrevocable fate
    "Uncertain all their lot save this--
      Who wins must lose, who lives must die:
    All trodden out into the dark
        Alike, all vanity
    She scarcely answered when I paused,
      But rather to herself said: "One
    Is here," low-voiced and loving, "Yea,
        Greater than Solomon
    So both were silent, she and I:
      She laid her work aside, and went
    Into the garden-walks, like spring,
        All gracious with content
    A little graver than her wont,
      Because her words had fretted me;
    Not warbling quite her merriest tune
        Bird-like from tree to tree
    I chose a book to read and dream:
      Yet half the while with furtive eyes
    Marked how she made her choice of flowers
        Intuitively wise
    And ranged them with instinctive taste
      Which all my books had failed to teach;
    Fresh rose herself, and daintier
        Than blossom of the peach
    By birthright higher than myself,
      Though nestling of the self-same nest:
    No fault of hers, no fault of mine,
        But stubborn to digest
    I watched her, till my book unmarked
      Slid noiseless to the velvet floor;
    Till all the opulent summer-world
        Looked poorer than before
    Just then her busy fingers ceased,
      Her fluttered colour went and came:
    I knew whose step was on the walk,
        Whose voice would name her name
    Well, twenty years have passed since then:
      My sister now, a stately wife
    Still fair, looks back in peace and sees
        The longer half of life
    The longer half of prosperous life,
      With little grief, or fear, or fret:
    She, loved and loving long ago,
        Is loved and loving yet
    A husband honourable, brave,
      Is her main wealth in all the world:
    And next to him one like herself,
        One daughter golden-curled
    Fair image of her own fair youth,
      As beautiful and as serene,
    With almost such another love
        As her own love has been
    Yet, though of world-wide charity,
      And in her home most tender dove,
    Her treasure and her heart are stored
        In the home-land of love
    She thrives, God's blessed husbandry;
      Most like a vine which full of fruit
    Doth cling and lean and climb toward heaven,
        While earth still binds its root
    I sit and watch my sister's face:
      How little altered since the hours
    When she, a kind, light-hearted girl,
        Gathered her garden flowers
    Her song just mellowed by regret
      For having teased me with her talk;
    Then all-forgetful as she heard
        One step upon the walk
    While I? I sat alone and watched;
      My lot in life, to live alone
    In mine own world of interests,
        Much felt, but little shown
    Not to be first: how hard to learn
      That lifelong lesson of the past;
    Line graven on line and stroke on stroke:
        But, thank God, learned at last
    So now in patience I possess
      My soul year after tedious year,
    Content to take the lowest place,
        The place assigned me here
    Yet sometimes, when I feel my strength
      Most weak, and life most burdensome,
    I lift mine eyes up to the hills
        From whence my help shall come
    Yea, sometimes still I lift my heart
      To the Archangelic trumpet-burst,
    When all deep secrets shall be shown,
        And many last be first
    Hope new born one pleasant morn
      Died at even;
    Hope dead lives nevermore,
      No, not in heaven
    If his shroud were but a cloud
      To weep itself away;
    Or were he buried underground
      To sprout some day!
    But dead and gone is dead and gone
      Vainly wept upon
    Nought we place above his face
      To mark the spot,
    But it shows a barren place
      In our lot
    A fool I was to sleep at noon,
      And wake when night is chilly
    Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
    A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
      A fool to snap my lily
    My garden-plot I have not kept;
      Faded and all-forsaken,
    I weep as I have never wept:
    Oh it was summer when I slept,
      It's winter now I waken
    Talk what you please of future spring
      And sun-warmed sweet to-morrow:--
    Stripped bare of hope and every thing,
    No more to laugh, no more to sing,
      I sit alone with sorrow
    I marked where lovely Venus and her court
      With song and dance and merry laugh went by;
      Weightless, their wingless feet seemed made to fly,
    Bound from the ground and in mid air to sport.
    Left far behind I heard the dolphins snort,
      Tracking their goddess with a wistful eye,
      Around whose head white doves rose, wheeling high
    Or low, and cooed after their tender sort.
    All this I saw in spring. Through summer heat
      I saw the lovely Queen of Love no more.
      But when flushed autumn through the woodlands went
    I spied sweet Venus walk amid the wheat:
      Whom seeing, every harvester gave o'er
      His toil, and laughed and hoped and was content
    Love that is dead and buried, yesterday
      Out of his grave rose up before my face,
      No recognition in his look, no trace
    Of memory in his eyes dust-dimmed and grey.
    While I, remembering, found no word to say,
      But felt my quickened heart leap in its place;
      Caught afterglow thrown back from long set days,
    Caught echoes of all music passed away.
    Was this indeed to meet?--I mind me yet
      In youth we met when hope and love were quick,
        We parted with hope dead, but love alive:
      I mind me how we parted then heart sick,
        Remembering, loving, hopeless, weak to strive:--
    Was this to meet? Not so, we have not met
    The sunrise wakes the lark to sing,
      The moonrise wakes the nightingale.
    Come darkness, moonrise, every thing
      That is so silent, sweet, and pale:
      Come, so ye wake the nightingale
    Make haste to mount, thou wistful moon,
      Make haste to wake the nightingale:
    Let silence set the world in tune
    To hearken to that wordless tale
    Which warbles from the nightingale
    One moment, for a nightingale
    Floods us with sorrow and delight.
      To-morrow thou shalt hoist the sail;
      Leave us to-night the nightingale
    Two days ago with dancing glancing hair,
      With living lips and eyes:
      Now pale, dumb, blind, she lies;
    So pale, yet still so fair
    We have not left her yet, not yet alone;
      But soon must leave her where
      She will not miss our care,
    Bone of our bone
    Weep not; O friends, we should not weep:
      Our friend of friends lies full of rest;
      No sorrow rankles in her breast,
    Fallen fast asleep
    She sleeps below,
      She wakes and laughs above;
      To-day, as she walked, let us walk in love,
    To-morrow follow so
    We met, hand to hand,
      We clasped hands close and fast,
    As close as oak and ivy stand;
      But it is past:
      Come day, come night, day comes at last
    We loosed hand from hand,
      We parted face from face;
    Each went his way to his own land
      At his own pace:
      Each went to fill his separate place
    If we should meet one day,
      If both should not forget.
    We shall clasp hands the accustomed way,
      As when we met
      So long ago, as I remember yet
    Where my heart is (wherever that may be)
      Might I but follow!
    If you fly thither over heath and lea,
    O honey-seeking bee,
      O careless swallow!
    Bid some for whom I watch keep watch for me
    So far asunder.
    Hours wax to days, and days and days creep by;
    I watch with wistful eye,
      I wait and wonder:
    When will that day draw nigh--that hour draw nigh
    Not yesterday, and not I think to-day;
      Perhaps to-morrow.
    Day after day "to-morrow," thus I say:
    I watched so yesterday
      In hope and sorrow,
    Again to-day I watch the accustomed way
    It's a year almost that I have not seen her:
    Oh, last summer green things were greener,
    Brambles fewer, the blue sky bluer
    It's surely summer, for there's a swallow:
    Come one swallow, his mate will follow,
    The bird race quicken and wheel and thicken
    Oh happy swallow whose mate will follow
    O'er height, o'er hollow! I'd be a swallow,
    To build this weather one nest together
    A smile because the nights are short!
      And every morning brings such pleasure
    Of sweet love-making, harmless sport:
      Love that makes and finds its treasure;
      Love, treasure without measure
    A sigh because the days are long!
      Long, long these days that pass in sighing,
    A burden saddens every song:
      While time lags which should be flying,
      We live who would be dying
    "O where are you going with your love-locks flowing,
      On the west wind blowing along this valley track?"
    "The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
      We shall escape the uphill by never turning back
    So they two went together in glowing August weather,
      The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
    And dear she was to doat on, her swift feet seemed to float on
      The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight
    "Oh, what is that in heaven where grey cloud-flakes are seven,
      Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?"
    "Oh, that's a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
      An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt
    "Oh, what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
      Their scent comes rich and sickly?"--"A scaled and hooded worm."
    "Oh, what's that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?"
      "Oh, that's a thin dead body which waits the eternal term
    "Turn again, O my sweetest,--turn again, false and fleetest:
      This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell's own track."
    "Nay, too steep for hill mounting; nay, too late for cost counting:
      This downhill path is easy, but there's no turning back
    In the bleak mid-winter
      Frosty wind made moan,
    Earth stood hard as iron,
      Water like a stone;
    Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
      Snow on snow,
    In the bleak mid-winter
      Long ago
    Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
      Nor earth sustain;
    Heaven and earth shall flee away
      When He comes to reign:
    In the bleak mid-winter
      A stable-place sufficed
    The Lord God Almighty
      Jesus Christ
    Enough for Him whom cherubim
      Worship night and day,
    A breastful of milk
      And a mangerful of hay;
    Enough for Him whom angels
      Fall down before,
    The ox and ass and camel
      Which adore
    Angels and archangels
      May have gathered there,
    Cherubim and seraphim
      Throng'd the air,
    But only His mother
      In her maiden bliss
    Worshipped her Beloved
      With a kiss
    What can I give Him,
      Poor as I am?
    If I were a shepherd
      I would bring a lamb,
    If I were a wise man
      I would do my part,--
    Yet what I can I give Him,
      Give my heart
    Here, where I dwell, I waste to skin and bone;
      The curse is come upon me, and I waste
      In penal torment powerless to atone.
    The curse is come on me, which makes no haste
      And doth not tarry, crushing both the proud
      Hard man and him the sinner double-faced.
    Look not upon me, for my soul is bowed
      Within me, as my body in this mire;
      My soul crawls dumb-struck, sore bestead and cowed
    As Sodom and Gomorrah scourged by fire,
      As Jericho before God's trumpet-peal,
      So we the elect ones perish in His ire.
    Vainly we gird on sackcloth, vainly kneel
      With famished faces toward Jerusalem:
      His heart is shut against us not to feel,
    His ears against our cry He shutteth them,
      His hand He shorteneth that He will not save,
      His law is loud against us to condemn:
    And we, as unclean bodies in the grave
      Inheriting corruption and the dark,
      Are outcast from His presence which we crave.
    Our Mercy hath departed from His Ark,
      Our Glory hath departed from His rest,
      Our Shield hath left us naked as a mark
    Unto all pitiless eyes made manifest.
      Our very Father hath forsaken us,
      Our God hath cast us from Him: we oppress'd
    Unto our foes are even marvellous,
      A hissing and a butt for pointing hands,
      Whilst God Almighty hunts and grinds us thus;
    For He hath scattered us in alien lands,
      Our priests, our princes, our anointed king,
      And bound us hand and foot with brazen bands.
    Here while I sit, my painful heart takes wing
      Home to the home-land I may see no more,
      Where milk and honey flow, where waters spring
    And fail not, where I dwelt in days of yore
      Under my fig-tree and my fruitful vine,
      There where my parents dwelt at ease before:
    Now strangers press the olives that are mine,
      Reap all the corners of my harvest-field,
      And make their fat hearts wanton with my wine;
    To them my trees, to them my gardens yield
      Their sweets and spices and their tender green,
      O'er them in noontide heat outspread their shield.
    Yet these are they whose fathers had not been
      Housed with my dogs; whom hip and thigh we smote
      And with their blood washed their pollutions clean,
    Purging the land which spewed them from its throat;
      Their daughters took we for a pleasant prey,
      Choice tender ones on whom the fathers dote:
    Now they in turn have led our own away;
      Our daughters and our sisters and our wives
      Sore weeping as they weep who curse the day,
    To live, remote from help, dishonoured lives,
      Soothing their drunken masters with a song,
      Or dancing in their golden tinkling gyves--
    Accurst if they remember through the long
      Estrangement of their exile, twice accursed
      If they forget and join the accursèd throng.
    How doth my heart that is so wrung not burst
      When I remember that my way was plain,
      And that God's candle lit me at the first,
    Whilst now I grope in darkness, grope in vain,
      Desiring but to find Him Who is lost,
      To find him once again, but once again!
    His wrath came on us to the uttermost,
      His covenanted and most righteous wrath.
      Yet this is He of Whom we made our boast,
    Who lit the Fiery Pillar in our path,
      Who swept the Red Sea dry before our feet,
      Who in His jealousy smote kings, and hath
    Sworn once to David: One shall fill thy seat
      Born of thy body, as the sun and moon
      'Stablished for aye in sovereignty complete.
    O Lord, remember David, and that soon.
      The Glory hath departed, Ichabod!
      Yet now, before our sun grow dark at noon,
    Before we come to nought beneath Thy rod,
      Before we go down quick into the pit,
      Remember us for good, O God, our God:--
    Thy Name will I remember, praising it,
      Though Thou forget me, though Thou hide Thy face,
      And blot me from the Book which Thou hast writ;
    Thy Name will I remember in my praise
      And call to mind Thy faithfulness of old,
    Though as a weaver Thou cut off my days
      And end me as a tale ends that is told
    Once in a dream I saw the flowers
      That bud and bloom in Paradise;
      More fair they are than waking eyes
    Have seen in all this world of ours.
    And faint the perfume-bearing rose,
      And faint the lily on its stem,
    And faint the perfect violet
        Compared with them
    I heard the songs of Paradise:
      Each bird sat singing in his place;
      A tender song so full of grace
    It soared like incense to the skies.
    Each bird sat singing to his mate
      Soft-cooing notes among the trees:
    The nightingale herself were cold
        To such as these
    I saw the fourfold River flow,
      And deep it was, with golden sand;
      It flowed between a mossy land
    With murmured music grave and low.
    It hath refreshment for all thirst,
      For fainting spirits strength and rest;
    Earth holds not such a draught as this
        From east to west
    The Tree of Life stood budding there,
      Abundant with its twelvefold fruits;
      Eternal sap sustains its roots,
    Its shadowing branches fill the air.
    Its leaves are healing for the world,
      Its fruit the hungry world can feed,
    Sweeter than honey to the taste,
        And balm indeed
    I saw the gate called Beautiful;
      And looked, but scarce could look within;
      I saw the golden streets begin,
    And outskirts of the glassy pool.
    Oh harps, oh crowns of plenteous stars,
      O green palm branches many-leaved--
    Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
        Nor heart conceived
    I hope to see these things again,
      But not as once in dreams by night;
      To see them with my very sight,
    And touch and handle and attain:
    To have all Heaven beneath my feet
      For narrow way that once they trod;
    To have my part with all the saints,
        And with my God
    I am pale with sick desire,
      For my heart is far away
    From this world's fitful fire
      And this world's waning day;
    In a dream it overleaps
      A world of tedious ills
    To where the sunshine sleeps
      On the everlasting hills.--
      Say the Saints: There Angels ease us
        Glorified and white.
      They say: We rest in Jesus,
        Where is not day or night
    My soul saith: I have sought
      For a home that is not gained,
    I have spent yet nothing bought,
      Have laboured but not attained;
    My pride strove to mount and grow,
      And hath but dwindled down;
    My love sought love, and lo!
      Hath not attained its crown.--
      Say the Saints: Fresh souls increase us,
        None languish or recede.
      They say: We love our Jesus,
        And He loves us indeed
    I cannot rise above,
      I cannot rest beneath,
    I cannot find out love,
      Or escape from death;
    Dear hopes and joys gone by
      Still mock me with a name;
    My best belovèd die,
      And I cannot die with them.--
      Say the Saints: No deaths decrease us,
        Where our rest is glorious.
      They say: We live in Jesus,
        Who once died for us
    O my soul, she beats her wings
      And pants to fly away
    Up to immortal things
      In the heavenly day:
    Yet she flags and almost faints;
      Can such be meant for me?--
    Come and see, say the Saints.
      Saith Jesus: Come and see.
      Say the Saints: His pleasures please us
        Before God and the Lamb.
      Come and taste My sweets, saith Jesus:
        Be with Me where I am
    It's oh in Paradise that I fain would be,
      Away from earth and weariness and all beside;
    Earth is too full of loss with its dividing sea,
      But Paradise upbuilds the bower for the bride
    Where flowers are yet in bud while the boughs are green,
      I would get quit of earth and get robed for heaven;
    Putting on my raiment white within the screen,
      Putting on my crown of gold whose gems are seven
    Fair are the trees fruit-bearing of the wood,
    Fair are the gold and bdellium and the onyx stone,
      And I know the gold of that land is good
    O my love, my dove, lift up your eyes
      Toward the eastern gate like an opening rose;
    You and I who parted will meet in Paradise,
      Pass within and sing when the gates unclose
    This life is but the passage of a day,
      This life is but a pang and all is over;
    But in the life to come which fades not away
      Every love shall abide and every lover
    He who wore out pleasure and mastered all lore,
      Solomon, wrote "Vanity of vanities:"
    Down to death, of all that went before
      In his mighty long life, the record is this
    With loves by the hundred, wealth beyond measure,
      Is this he who wrote "Vanity of vanities"?
    Yea, "Vanity of vanities" he saith of pleasure,
      And of all he learned set his seal to this
    Yet we love and faint not, for our love is one,
      And we hope and flag not, for our hope is sure,
    Although there be nothing new beneath the sun
      And no help for life and for death no cure
    The road to death is life, the gate of life is death,
      We who wake shall sleep, we shall wax who wane;
    Let us not vex our souls for stoppage of a breath,
      The fall of a river that turneth not again
    Be the road short, and be the gate near,--
      Shall a short road tire, a strait gate appall?
    The loves that meet in Paradise shall cast out fear,
      And Paradise hath room for you and me and all
    "O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      Me whom thou settest in a barren land,
      Hungry and thirsty on the burning sand,
    Hungry and thirsty where no waters be
    Nor shadows of date-bearing tree:--
    O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me
    "I came from Edom by as parched a track,
      As rough a track beneath My bleeding feet.
      I came from Edom seeking thee, and sweet
    I counted bitterness; I turned not back
    But counted life as death, and trod
    The winepress all alone: and I am God
    "Yet, Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      For Thou art strong to comfort: and could I
      But comfort one I love, who, like to die,
    Lifts feeble hands and eyes that fail to see
    In one last prayer for comfort--nay,
    I could not stand aside or turn away
    "Alas! thou knowest that for thee I died
      For thee I thirsted with the dying thirst;
      I, Blessed, for thy sake was counted cursed,
    In sight of men and angels crucified:
    All this and more I bore to prove
    My love, and wilt thou yet mistrust My love
    "Lord, I am fain to think Thou lovest me,
      For Thou art all in all and I am Thine;
      And lo! Thy love is better than new wine,
    And I am sick of love in loving Thee.
    But dost Thou love me? speak and save,
    For jealousy is cruel as the grave
    "Nay, if thy love is not an empty breath
      My love is as thine own--deep answers deep.
      Peace, peace: I give to my beloved sleep,
    Not death but sleep, for love is strong as death:
    Take patience; sweet thy sleep shall be,
    Yea, thou shalt wake in Paradise with Me
    Why should I call Thee Lord, Who art my God?
      Why should I call Thee Friend, Who art my Love?
      Or King, Who art my very Spouse above?
    Or call Thy Sceptre on my heart Thy rod?
      Lo, now Thy banner over me is love,
    All heaven flies open to me at Thy nod:
    For Thou hast lit Thy flame in me a clod,
      Made me a nest for dwelling of Thy Dove.
      What wilt Thou call me in our home above,
    Who now hast called me friend? how will it be
        When Thou for good wine settest forth the best?
    Now Thou dost bid me come and sup with Thee,
        Now Thou dost make me lean upon Thy breast:
    How will it be with me in time of love
    At morn I plucked a rose and gave it Thee,
      A rose of joy and happy love and peace,
        A rose with scarce a thorn:
        But in the chillness of a second morn
      My rose bush drooped, and all its gay increase
    Was but one thorn that wounded me
    I plucked the thorn and offered it to Thee;
      And for my thorn Thou gavest love and peace,
        Not joy this mortal morn:
        If Thou hast given much treasure for a thorn,
      Wilt thou not give me for my rose increase
    Of gladness, and all sweets to me
    My thorny rose, my love and pain, to Thee
      I offer; and I set my heart in peace,
        And rest upon my thorn:
        For verily I think to-morrow morn
      Shall bring me Paradise, my gift's increase,
    Yea, give Thy very Self to me
    God strengthen me to bear myself;
    That heaviest weight of all to bear,
    Inalienable weight of care
    All others are outside myself;
    I lock my door and bar them out,
    The turmoil, tedium, gad-about
    I lock my door upon myself,
    And bar them out; but who shall wall
    Self from myself, most loathed of all
    If I could once lay down myself,
    And start self-purged upon the race
    That all must run! Death runs apace
    If I could set aside myself,
    And start with lightened heart upon
    The road by all men overgone
    God harden me against myself,
    This coward with pathetic voice
    Who craves for ease and rest and joys
    Myself, arch-traitor to myself;
    My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe,
    My clog whatever road I go
    Yet One there is can curb myself,
    Can roll the strangling load from me.
    Break off the yoke and set me free
    My sun has set, I dwell
    In darkness as a dead man out of sight;
    And none remains, not one, that I should tell
    To him mine evil plight
    This bitter night.
    I will make fast my door
    That hollow friends may trouble me no more
    "Friend, open to Me."--Who is this that calls?
    Nay, I am deaf as are my walls:
    Cease crying, for I will not hear
    Thy cry of hope or fear.
    Others were dear,
    Others forsook me: what art thou indeed
    That I should heed
    Thy lamentable need?
    Hungry should feed,
    Or stranger lodge thee here
    "Friend, My Feet bleed.
    Open thy door to Me and comfort Me."
    I will not open, trouble me no more.
    Go on thy way footsore,
    I will not rise and open unto thee
    "Then is it nothing to thee? Open, see
    Who stands to plead with thee.
    Open, lest I should pass thee by, and thou
    One day entreat My Face
    And howl for grace,
    And I be deaf as thou art now.
    Open to Me
    Then I cried out upon him: Cease,
    Leave me in peace:
    Fear not that I should crave
    Aught thou mayst have.
    Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more,
    Lest I arise and chase thee from my door.
    What, shall I not be let
    Alone, that thou dost vex me yet
    But all night long that voice spake urgently:
    "Open to Me."
    Still harping in mine ears:
    "Rise, let Me in."
    Pleading with tears:
    "Open to Me that I may come to thee."
    While the dew dropped, while the dark hours were cold:
    "My Feet bleed, see My Face,
    See My Hands bleed that bring thee grace,
    My Heart doth bleed for thee,
    Open to Me
    So till the break of day:
    Then died away
    That voice, in silence as of sorrow;
    Then footsteps echoing like a sigh
    Passed me by,
    Lingering footsteps slow to pass.
    On the morrow
    I saw upon the grass
    Each footprint marked in blood, and on my door
    The mark of blood forevermore
    Thou who didst hang upon a barren tree,
    My God, for me;
      Though I till now be barren, now at length,
      Lord, give me strength
    To bring forth fruit to Thee
    Thou who didst bear for me the crown of thorn,
    Spitting and scorn;
      Though I till now have put forth thorns, yet now
      Strengthen me Thou
    That better fruit be borne
    Thou Rose of Sharon, Cedar of broad roots,
    Vine of sweet fruits,
      Thou Lily of the vale with fadeless leaf,
      Of thousands Chief,
    Feed Thou my feeble shoots
    If I might only love my God and die!
    But now He bids me love Him and live on,
      Now when the bloom of all my life is gone,
    The pleasant half of life has quite gone by.
    My tree of hope is lopped that spread so high,
      And I forget how summer glowed and shone,
      While autumn grips me with its fingers wan,
    And frets me with its fitful windy sigh.
    When autumn passes then must winter numb,
      And winter may not pass a weary while,
        But when it passes spring shall flower again:
      And in that spring who weepeth now shall smile,
        Yea, they shall wax who now are on the wane,
    Yea, they shall sing for love when Christ shall come
    I love and love not: Lord, it breaks my heart
      To love and not to love.
    Thou veiled within Thy glory, gone apart
      Into Thy shrine, which is above,
    Dost Thou not love me, Lord, or care
      For this mine ill?--
    _I love thee here or there,_
      _I will accept thy broken heart, lie still._
    That cometh not again,
    When I was fresh and cheerful, who but I?
      I fresh, I cheerful: worn with pain
    Now, out of sight and out of heart;
      O Lord, how long?--
    _I watch thee as thou art,_
      _I will accept thy fainting heart, be strong._
    What of to-morrow, Lord?
    Shall there be rest from toil, be truce from sorrow,
      Be living green upon the sward
    Now but a barren grave to me,
      Be joy for sorrow?--
    _Did I not die for thee?_
      _Do I not live for thee? leave Me to-morrow._
    I would have gone; God bade me stay:
      I would have worked; God bade me rest.
    He broke my will from day to day,
      He read my yearnings unexpressed,
        And said them nay
    Now I would stay; God bids me go:
      Now I would rest; God bids me work.
    He breaks my heart tossed to and fro,
      My soul is wrung with doubts that lurk
        And vex it so
    I go, Lord, where Thou sendest me;
      Day after day I plod and moil:
    But, Christ my God, when will it be
      That I may let alone my toil
        And rest with Thee
    We meet in joy, though we part in sorrow;
    We part to-night, but we meet to-morrow.
    Be it flood or blood the path that's trod,
    All the same it leads home to God:
    Be it furnace-fire voluminous,
    One like God's Son will walk with us
    What are these that glow from afar,
    These that lean over the golden bar,
    Strong as the lion, pure as the dove,
    With open arms and hearts of love?
    They the blessed ones gone before,
    They the blessed forevermore.
    Out of great tribulation they went
    Home to their home of Heaven-content;
    Through flood, or blood, or furnace-fire,
    To the rest that fulfils desire
    What are these that fly as a cloud,
    With flashing heads and faces bowed,
    In their mouths a victorious psalm,
    In their hands a robe and a palm?
    Welcoming angels these that shine,
    Your own angel, and yours, and mine;
    Who have hedged us both day and night
    On the left hand and on the right,
    Who have watched us both night and day
    Because the Devil keeps watch to slay
    Light above light, and Bliss beyond bliss,
    Whom words cannot utter, lo, Who is This?
    As a King with many crowns He stands,
    And our names are graven upon His hands;
    As a Priest, with God-uplifted eyes,
    He offers for us His Sacrifice;
    As the Lamb of God for sinners slain,
    That we too may live He lives again;
    As our Champion behold Him stand,
    Strong to save us, at God's Right Hand
    God the Father give us grace
    To walk in the light of Jesus' Face.
    God the Son give us a part
    In the hiding-place of Jesus' Heart:
    God the Spirit so hold us up
    That we may drink of Jesus' cup
    Death is short and life is long;
    Satan is strong, but Christ more strong.
    At His Word, Who hath led us hither,
    The Red Sea must part hither and thither.
    At His Word, Who goes before us too,
    Jordan must cleave to let us through
    Yet one pang, searching and sore,
    And then Heaven forevermore;
    Yet one moment awful and dark,
    Then safety within the Veil and the Ark;
    Yet one effort by Christ His grace,
    Then Christ forever face to face
    God the Father we will adore,
    In Jesus' Name, now and evermore:
    God the Son we will love and thank
    In this flood and on the farther bank:
    God the Holy Ghost we will praise,
    In Jesus' Name, through endless days:
    God Almighty, God Three in One,
    God Almighty, God alone
    As eager home-bound traveller to the goal,
      Or steadfast seeker on an unsearched main,
    Or martyr panting for an aureole,
      My fellow-pilgrims pass me, and attain
    That hidden mansion of perpetual peace,
      Where keen desire and hope dwell free from pain:
    That gate stands open of perennial ease;
      I view the glory till I partly long,
    Yet lack the fire of love which quickens these.
      O, passing Angel, speed me with a song,
    A melody of heaven to reach my heart
      And rouse me to the race and make me strong;
    Till in such music I take up my part,
      Swelling those Hallelujahs full of rest,
    One, tenfold, hundred-fold, with heavenly art,
      Fulfilling north and south and east and west,
    Thousand, ten-thousand-fold, innumerable,
      All blent in one yet each one manifest;
    Each one distinguished and beloved as well
      As if no second voice in earth or heaven
    Were lifted up the Love of God to tell.
      Ah, Love of God, which Thine Own Self hast given
    To me most poor, and made me rich in love,
      Love that dost pass the tenfold seven times seven.
    Draw Thou mine eyes, draw Thou my heart above,
      My treasure and my heart store Thou in Thee,
    Brood over me with yearnings of a dove;
      Be Husband, Brother, closest Friend to me;
    Love me as very mother loves her son,
      Her sucking firstborn fondled on her knee:
    Yea, more than mother loves her little one;
      For, earthly, even a mother may forget
    And feel no pity for its piteous moan;
      But Thou, O Love of God, remember yet,
    Through the dry desert, through the waterflood
      (Life, death), until the Great White Throne is set.
    If now I am sick in chewing the bitter cud
      Of sweet past sin, though solaced by Thy grace,
    And ofttimes strengthened by Thy Flesh and Blood,
      How shall I then stand up before Thy face,
    When from Thine eyes repentance shall be hid,
      And utmost Justice stand in Mercy's place:
    When every sin I thought or spoke or did
      Shall meet me at the inexorable bar,
    And there be no man standing in the mid
      To plead for me; while star fallen after star
    With heaven and earth are like a ripened shock,
      And all time's mighty works and wonders are
    Consumed as in a moment; when no rock
      Remains to fall on me, no tree to hide,
    But I stand all creation's gazing-stock,
      Exposed and comfortless on every side,
    Placed trembling in the final balances
      Whose poise this hour, this moment, must be tried?--
    Ah, Love of God, if greater love than this
      Hath no man, that a man die for his friend,
    And if such love of love Thine Own Love is,
      Plead with Thyself, with me, before the end;
    Redeem me from the irrevocable past;
      Pitch Thou Thy Presence round me to defend;
    Yea seek with piercèd feet, yea hold me fast
      With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love;
    Not what I am, remember what Thou wast
      When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above,
    And sin Thy Father's Face, while Thou didst drink
      The bitter cup of death, didst taste thereof
    For every man; while Thou wast nigh to sink
      Beneath the intense intolerable rod,
    Grown sick of love; not what I am, but think
      Thy Life then ransomed mine, my God, my God
    Am I a stone and not a sheep
      That I can stand, O Christ, beneath Thy Cross,
      To number drop by drop Thy Blood's slow loss,
    And yet not weep
    Not so those women loved
      Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee;
      Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly;
    Not so the thief was moved
    Not so the Sun and Moon
      Which hid their faces in a starless sky,
      A horror of great darkness at broad noon,--
    I, only
    Yet give not o'er,
      But seek Thy sheep, true Shepherd of the flock;
    Greater than Moses, turn and look once more
      And smite a rock
    Give me the lowest place: not that I dare
      Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died
    That I might live and share
      Thy glory by Thy side
    Give me the lowest place: or if for me
      That lowest place too high, make one more low
    Where I may sit and see
      My God and love Thee so
    Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome
      Has many sonnets: so here now shall be
      One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me
    To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home,
      To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee
    I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;
      Whose service is my special dignity,
    And she my loadstar while I go and come.
    And so because you love me, and because
      I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath
        Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name:
        In you not fourscore years can dim the flame
    Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws
      Of time and change and mortal life and death
    Where are the songs I used to know,
      Where are the notes I used to sing?
      I have forgotten everything
    I used to know so long ago;
    Summer has followed after Spring;
      Now Autumn is so shrunk and sere,
    I scarcely think a sadder thing
      Can be the Winter of my year
    Yet Robin sings through Winter's rest,
      When bushes put their berries on;
      While they their ruddy jewels don,
    He sings out of a ruddy breast;
    The hips and haws and ruddy breast
      Make one spot warm where snowflakes lie
    They break and cheer the unlovely rest
      Of Winter's pause--and why not

      _Scene_: A Cottage with its Grounds
    [A room in a large comfortable cottage; a fire burning on
    the hearth; a table on which the breakfast things have
    been left standing. January discovered seated by the
    fire
              _January._
  Dim the day until the cold dark night
                        [Stirs the fire
    Crackle, sparkle, fagot; embers glow:
    Some one may be plodding through the snow
    Longing for a light,
    For the light that you and I can show.
    If no one else should come,
    Here Robin Redbreast's welcome to a crumb,
    And never troublesome:
    Robin, why don't you come and fetch your crumb
      Here's butter for my hunch of bread,
        And sugar for your crumb;
      Here's room upon the hearthrug,
        If you'll only come
      In your scarlet waistcoat,
        With your keen bright eye,
      Where are you loitering?
        Wings were made to fly
      Make haste to breakfast,
        Come and fetch your crumb,
      For I'm as glad to see you
        As you are glad to come
    [Two Robin Redbreasts are seen tapping with their beaks at
    the lattice, which January opens. The birds flutter in,
    hop about the floor, and peck up the crumbs and sugar
    thrown to them. They have scarcely finished their meal,
    when a knock is heard at the door. January hangs a
    guard in front of the fire, and opens to February, who
    appears with a bunch of snowdrops in her hand
              _January._
            _February._
  I've brought some snowdrops; only just a few,
    But quite enough to prove the world awake,
    Cheerful and hopeful in the frosty dew
    And for the pale sun's sake
    [She hands a few of her snowdrops to January, who retires
    into the background. While February stands arranging
    the remaining snowdrops in a glass of water on the
    window-sill, a soft butting and bleating are heard outside.
    She opens the door, and sees one foremost lamb, with
    other sheep and lambs bleating and crowding towards
    her
              _February._
  You wonderful, you woolly soft white lamb:
    You panting mother ewe, come too,
    And lead that tottering twin
    Safe in:
    Bring all your bleating kith and kin,
    Except the horny ram
    [February opens a second door in the background, and the
    little flock files through into a warm and sheltered compartment
    out of sight
      The lambkin tottering in its walk
        With just a fleece to wear;
      The snowdrop drooping on its stalk
          So slender,--
      Snowdrop and lamb, a pretty pair,
      Braving the cold for our delight,
          Both white,
          Both tender
    [A rattling of doors and windows; branches seen without,
    tossing violently to and fro
    How the doors rattle, and the branches sway!
    Here's brother March comes whirling on his way
    With winds that eddy and sing
    [She turns the handle of the door, which bursts open, and
    discloses March hastening up, both hands full of violets
    and anemones
              _February._
  For I have said my say, fulfilled my day,
    And must away
              _March._
      I blow an arouse
        Through the world's wide house
      To quicken the torpid earth:
        Grappling I fling
        Each feeble thing,
      But bring strong life to the birth.
        I wrestle and frown,
        And topple down;
      I wrench, I rend, I uproot;
        Yet the violet
        Is born where I set
      The sole of my flying foot
    [Hands violets and anemones to February, who retires into
    the background
        And in my wake
        Frail wind-flowers quake,
      And the catkins promise fruit.
        I drive ocean ashore
        With rush and roar,
      And he cannot say me nay:
        My harpstrings all
        Are the forests tall,
      Making music when I play.
        And as others perforce,
        So I on my course
      Run and needs must run,
        With sap on the mount
        And buds past count
      And rivers and clouds and sun,
        With seasons and breath
        And time and death
      And all that has yet begun
    [Before March has done speaking, a voice is heard approaching
    accompanied by a twittering of birds. April comes
    along singing, and stands outside and out of sight to finish
    her song
              _April._
    Pretty little three
      Sparrows in a tree,
        Light upon the wing;
        Though you cannot sing
        You can chirp of Spring:
      Chirp of Spring to me,
      Sparrows, from your tree
      Never mind the showers,
      Chirp about the flowers
        While you build a nest:
        Straws from east and west,
        Feathers from your breast,
      Make the snuggest bowers
      In a world of flowers
      You must dart away
      From the chosen spray,
        You intrusive third
        Extra little bird;
        Join the unwedded herd!
      These have done with play,
      And must work to-day
              _April._
  Good-morrow and good-bye: if others fly,
    Of all the flying months you're the most flying
              _March._
            _April._
  As wings and wind mean flying;
    So you and I and all things fly or die;
    And sometimes I sit sighing to think of dying.
    But meanwhile I've a rainbow in my showers,
    And a lapful of flowers,
    And these dear nestlings aged three hours;
    And here's their mother sitting,
    Their father's merely flitting
    To find their breakfast somewhere in my bowers
    [As she speaks April shows March her apron full of flowers
    and nest full of birds. March wanders away into the
    grounds. April, without entering the cottage, hangs over
    the hungry nestlings watching them
              _April._
      What voices shrill and weak;
      Who'd think that anything that sings
        Could sing through such a beak?
      Yet you'll be nightingales one day,
        And charm the country-side,
      When I'm away and far away
        And May is queen and bride
    [May arrives unperceived by April, and gives her a kiss.
    April starts and looks round
              _April._
            _May._
  Your sorrow's half in fun,
    Begun and done
    And turned to joy while twenty seconds run.
    I've gathered flowers all as I came along,
    At every step a flower
    Fed by your last bright shower
    [She divides an armful of all sorts of flowers with April, who
    strolls away through the garden
              _May._
  Of every bird in bower.
        The world and I are far too full of bliss
        To think or plan or toil or care;
          The sun is waxing strong,
          The days are waxing long,
            And all that is,
              Is fair
        Here are my buds of lily and of rose,
        And here's my namesake-blossom, may;
          And from a watery spot
          See here forget-me-not,
            With all that blows
              To-day
        Hark to my linnets from the hedges green,
        Blackbird and lark and thrush and dove,
          And every nightingale
          And cuckoo tells its tale,
            And all they mean
              Is love
    [June appears at the further end of the garden, coming slowly
    towards May, who, seeing her, exclaims
              _May._
            _June._
  To round your young May moon
    And set the world a-gasping at my noon.
    Yet come I must. So here are strawberries
    Sun-flushed and sweet, as many as you please;
    And here are full-blown roses by the score,
    More roses, and yet more

              _June._
    Raises and ripens everything;
    I need but sit beneath a leafy tree
        And watch and sing
    [Seats herself in the shadow of a laburnum
    Or if I'm lulled by note of bird and bee,
      Or lulled by noontide's silence deep,
    I need but nestle down beneath my tree
        And drop asleep
    [June falls asleep; and is not awakened by the voice of July,
    who behind the scenes is heard half singing, half calling
              _July._
  Blue flags, yellow flags, flags all freckled,
    Which will you take? yellow, blue, speckled!
    Take which you will, speckled, blue, yellow,
    Each in its way has not a fellow
    [Enter July, a basket of many-colored irises slung upon his
    shoulders, a bunch of ripe grass in one hand, and a plate
    piled full of peaches balanced upon the other. He steals
    up to June, and tickles her with the grass. She wakes
              _June._
            _July._
  The longest day slipped by you while you slept.
    I've brought you one curved pyramid of bloom
                            [Hands her the plate
    Not flowers, but peaches, gathered where the bees,
    As downy, bask and boom
    In sunshine and in gloom of trees.
    But get you in, a storm is at my heels;
    The whirlwind whistles and wheels,
    Lightning flashes and thunder peals,
    Flying and following hard upon my heels
    [June takes shelter in a thickly-woven arbor
              _July._
      From the east to the lurid west,
      The darkening sky, like a cup,
        Is filled with rain to the brink
      The sky is purple and fire,
        Blackness and noise and unrest;
      The earth, parched with desire,
          Opens her mouth to drink
      Send forth thy thunder and fire,
        Turn over thy brimming cup,
      O sky, appease the desire
        Of earth in her parched unrest;
      Pour out drink to her thirst,

        O sky with the rainbow crest;
      O earth, have done with desire,
        Drink, and drink deep, and rest
    [Enter August, carrying a sheaf made up of different kinds of
    grain
              _July._
  And scatheless from my storm.
    Your hands are full of corn, I see,
    As full as hands can be
    And earth and air both smell as sweet as balm
    In their recovered calm,
    And that they owe to me

        One in flesh and one in food;

          Who, with men together,

  September drawing nigh
    With the first thought of Autumn in her eye,
    And the first sigh
    Of Autumn wind among her locks that fly
    [September arrives, carrying upon her head a basket heaped
    high with fruit
              _September._
  Plums and these pears for you,
    A dozen kinds of apples, one or two
    Melons, some figs all bursting through
    Their skins, and pearled with dew
    These damsons violet-blue
    [While September is speaking, August lifts the basket to the
    ground, selects various fruits, and withdraws slowly along
    the gravel walk, eating a pear as he goes
              _September._
      Because my green leaves die;
    Sweet are my fruits, but all my leaves are dying;
        And well may Autumn sigh,
          And well may I
      Who watch the sere leaves flying
        My leaves that fade and fall,
        I note you one and all;
    I call you, and the Autumn wind is calling,
        Lamenting for your fall,
          And for the pall
      You spread on earth in falling
    And here's a song of flowers to suit such hours:
    A song of the last lilies, the last flowers,
    Amid my withering bowers
        In the sunny garden bed
          Lilies look so pale,
        Lilies droop the head
          In the shady grassy vale;
        If all alike they pine
        In shade and in shine,
        If everywhere they grieve,
        Where will lilies live
    [October enters briskly, some leafy twigs bearing different
    sorts of nuts in one hand, and a long ripe hop-bine trailing
    after him from the other. A dahlia is stuck in his
    buttonhole
              _October._
  Even if the year has done with corn and clover,
    With flowers and leaves; besides, in fact it's true,
    Some leaves remain and some flowers too.
    For me and you.
    Now see my crops
                [Offering his produce to September
                I've brought you nuts and hops;
    And when the leaf drops, why, the walnut drops
    [October wreaths the hop-bine about September's neck, and
    gives her the nut twigs. They enter the cottage together,
    but without shutting the door. She steps into the background:

    stirs up the smouldering fire, and arranges several chestnuts
    ready to roast

      Spring one bright day will lure back the flowers;

      Never fancy I've tears in my showers;
      Dance, nights and days! and dance on, my hours
                [Sees November approaching
              _October._
  And grim,
    With dismal ways.
    What cheer, November
              _November._
  Nought have I to bring,
    Tramping a-chill and shivering,
    Except these pine-cones for a blaze,--
    Except a fog which follows,
    And stuffs up all the hollows,--
    Except a hoar frost here and there,--
    Except some shooting stars
    Which dart their luminous cars
    Trackless and noiseless through the keen night air

    while November throws her pine cones on the
    fire, and sits down listlessly

    There's nought desired and nought required

    And know that she will wake to mirth
        By and by

    in the direction of the door. He knocks

  Ah, here's my youngest brother come at last:
    Come in, December
    [He opens the door and enters, loaded with evergreens in
    berry, etc
              _November._
  For now it's snowing fast;
    It snows, and will snow more and more;
    Don't let it drift in on the floor.
    But you, you're all aglow; how can you be
    Rosy and warm and smiling in the cold
              _December._
  But open doors and open hearts and glee

      Dimmest and brightest month am I;
    My short days end, my lengthening days begin;

        May keep, so sweet and frail
      May keep each merry singing bird,

    For I've a carol which some shepherds heard
        Once in a wintry field
    [While December concludes his song all the other Months
    troop in from the garden, or advance out of the background.
    The Twelve join hands in a circle, and begin
    dancing round to a stately measure as the Curtain falls
    A boat amid the ripples, drifting, rocking,
      Two idle people, without pause or aim;
    While in the ominous west there gathers darkness
        Flushed with flame
    A haycock in a hayfield backing, lapping,
      Two drowsy people pillowed round about;
    While in the ominous west across the darkness
        Flame leaps out
    Better a wrecked life than a life so aimless,
      Better a wrecked life than a life so soft;
    The ominous west glooms thundering, with its fire
        Lit aloft
    To come back from the sweet South, to the North
      Where I was born, bred, look to die;
    Come back to do my day's work in its day,
          Play out my play--
      Amen, amen, say
    To see no more the country half my own,
      Nor hear the half familiar speech,
    Amen, I say; I turn to that bleak North
          Whence I came forth--
      The South lies out of reach
    But when our swallows fly back to the South,
      To the sweet South, to the sweet South,
    The tears may come again into my eyes
          On the old wise,
      And the sweet name to my mouth
    The mystery of Life, the mystery
    Of Death, I see
    Darkly as in a glass;
    Their shadows pass,
    And talk with me
    As the flush of a Morning Sky,
    As a Morning Sky colorless--
    Each yields its measure of light
    To a wet world or a dry;
    Each fares through day to night
    With equal pace,
    And then each one
    Is done
    As the Sun with glory and grace
    In his face,
    Benignantly hot,
    Graciously radiant and keen,
    Ready to rise and to run,--
    Not without spot,
    Not even the Sun
    As the Moon
    On the wax, on the wane,
    With night for her noon;
    Vanishing soon,
    To appear again
    As Roses that droop
    Half warm, half chill, in the languid May,
    And breathe out a scent
    Sweet and faint;
    Till the wind gives one swoop
    To scatter their beauty away
    As Lilies a multitude,
    One dipping, one rising, one sinking,
    On rippling waters, clear blue
    And pure for their drinking;
    One new dead, and one opened anew,
    And all good
    As a cankered pale Flower,
    With death for a dower,
    Each hour of its life half dead;
    With death for a crown
    Weighing down
    Its head
    As an Eagle, half strength and half grace,
    Most potent to face
    Unwinking the splendor of light;
    Harrying the East and the West,
    Soaring aloft from our sight;
    Yet one day or one night dropped to rest,
    On the low common earth
    Of his birth
    As a Dove,
    Not alone,
    In a world of her own
    Full of fluttering soft noises
    And tender sweet voices
    Of love
    As a Mouse
    Keeping house
    In the fork of a tree,
    With nuts in a crevice,
    And an acorn or two;
    What cares he
    For blossoming boughs,
    Or the song-singing bevies
    Of birds in their glee,
    Scarlet, or golden, or blue
    As a Mole grubbing underground;
    When it comes to the light
    It grubs its way back again,
    Feeling no bias of fur
    To hamper it in its stir,
    Scant of pleasure and pain,
    Sinking itself out of sight
    Without sound
    As Waters that drop and drop,
    Weariness without end,
    That drop and never stop,
    Wear that nothing can mend,
    Till one day they drop--
    Stop--
    And there's an end,
    And matters mend
    As Trees, beneath whose skin
    We mark not the sap begin
    To swell and rise,
    Till the whole bursts out in green:
    We mark the falling leaves
    When the wide world grieves
    And sighs
    As a Forest on fire,
    Where maddened creatures desire
    Wet mud or wings
    Beyond all those things
    Which could assuage desire
    On this side the flaming fire
    As Wind with a sob and sigh
    To which there comes no reply
    But a rustle and shiver
    From rushes of the river;
    As Wind with a desolate moan,
    Moaning on alone
    As a Desert all sand,
    Blank, neither water nor land
    For solace, or dwelling, or culture,
    Where the storms and the wild creatures howl;
    Given over to lion and vulture,
    To ostrich, and jackal, and owl:
    Yet somewhere an oasis lies;
    There waters arise
    To nourish one seedling of balm,
    Perhaps, or one palm
    As the Sea,
    Murmuring, shifting, swaying;
    One time sunnily playing,
    One time wrecking and slaying;
    In whichever mood it be,
    Worst or best,
    Never at rest
    As still Waters and deep,
    As shallow Waters that brawl,
    As rapid Waters that leap
    To their fall
    As Music, as Color, as Shape,
    Keys of rapture and pain
    Turning in vain
    In a lock which turns not again,
    While breaths and moments escape
    As Spring, all bloom and desire;
    As Summer, all gift and fire;
    As Autumn, a dying glow;
    As Winter, with nought to show
    Winter which lays its dead all out of sight,
    All clothed in white,
    All waiting for the long-awaited light
    There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
    What seems is not always as it seems
    I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
    And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning
    Went sailing toward the East:
    The first had sails like fire,
    The next like glittering wire,
    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;
    And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast
    The first choir breathed in flutes,
    And fingered soft guitars;
    The second won from lutes
    Harmonious chords and jars,
    With drums for stormy bars:
    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
    Notes of triumph, then
    An alarm again,
    As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers
    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;
    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;
    The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.
    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
    The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;
    The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.
    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;
    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;
    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace
    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
    Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
    Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
    Sighs, but scarce of woe;
    All the sighing
    Wooed such sweet replying;
    All the sighing, sweet and low,
    Used to come and go
    For more pleasure, merely so.
    Yet at intervals some one grew tired
    Of everything desired,
    And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,
    Out of sight
    The second crew seemed ever
    Wider-visioned, graver,
    More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
    With heads erect and proud,
    And voices sometimes loud;
    With endless tacking, counter-tacking,
    All things grasping, all things lacking,
    It would seem;
    Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
    Drifting on as in a dream.
    Hoarding to their utmost bent,
    Feasting to their fill,
    Yet gnawed by discontent,
    Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
    Their freight was not a treasure,
    Their music not a pleasure;
    The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
    Sceptre and crown changed hands
    The third crew as they went
    Seemed mostly different;
    They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
    As all the world might see.
    They labored at the oar,
    While on their heads they bore
    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
    They labored at the oar hand-sore,
    Till rain went splashing,
    And spray went dashing,
    Down on them, and up on them, more and more.
    Their sails were patched and rent,
    Their masts were bent,
    In peril of their lives they worked and went.
    For them no feast was spread,
    No soft luxurious bed
    Scented and white,
    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;
    In weariness and painfulness,
    In thirst and sore distress,
    They rowed and steered from left to right
    With all their might.
    Their trumpeters and harpers round about
    Incessantly played out,
    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;
    But oftener they groaned or wept,
    And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept.
    I wept for pity watching them, but more
    I wept heart-sore
    Once and again to see
    Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim
    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:
    And there all welcomed him
    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;
    Now one man, now another,
    --Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,--
    Changed openly, or changed by stealth,
    Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well.
    The most left Love ship, hauling wealth
    Up Worm ship's side;
    While some few hollow-eyed
    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;
    But this, though not remote,
    Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
    Scarce ever came again,
    But seemed to loathe his erst companions,
    And wish and work them bane
    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
    Whence a waterspout
    Instantaneously leaped out,
    Roaring as it reared its head
    Soon I spied a something dim,
    Many-handed, grim,
    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;
    It puffed their sails full out
    With puffs of smoky breath
    From a smouldering lip,
    And cleared the waterspout
    Which reeled roaring round about
    Threatening death.
    With a horny hand it steered,
    And a horn appeared
    On its sneering head upreared
    Haughty and high
    Against the blackening lowering sky.
    With a hoof it swayed the waves;
    They opened here and there,
    Till I spied deep ocean graves
    Full of skeletons
    That were men and women once
    Foul or fair;
    Full of things that creep
    And fester in the deep
    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air
    The third bark held aloof
    From the Monster with the hoof,
    Despite his urgent beck,
    And fraught with guile
    Abominable his smile;
    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
    Then full of awe,
    With these same eyes I saw
    His head incredible retract its horn
    Rounding like babe's new born,
    While silvery phosphorescence played
    About his dis-horned head.
    The sneer smoothed from his lip,
    He beamed blandly on the ship;
    All winds sank to a moan,
    All waves to a monotone
    (For all these seemed his realm),
    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm
    Then a cry well nigh of despair
    Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
    The harpers harped no more,
    While the trumpeters sounded sore
    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
    To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
    To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,
    Or no more help or hope for ever!--
    The planks strained as though they must part asunder,
    The masts bent as though they must dip under,
    And the winds and the waves at length
    Girt up their strength,
    And the depths were laid bare,
    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder
    Through the rain-choked air,
    And sea and sky seemed to kiss
    In the horror and the hiss
    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere
    Lo! a Flyer swooping down
    With wings to span the globe,
    And splendor for his robe
    And splendor for his crown.
    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
    And spun the Monster overboard:
    And that monstrous thing abhorred,
    Gnashing with balked desire,
    Wriggled like a worm infirm
    Up the Worm
    Of the loathly figurehead.
    There he crouched and gnashed;
    And his head re-horned, and gashed
    From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red
    I saw that thing accurst
    Wreak his worst
    On the first and second crew:
    Some with baited hook
    He angled for and took,
    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
    Some he did to death
    With hoof or horn or blasting breath
    I heard a voice of wailing
    Where the ships went sailing,
    A sorrowful voice prevailing
    Above the sound of the sea,
    Above the singers' voices,
    And musical merry noises;
    All songs had turned to sighing,
    The light was failing,
    The day was dying--
    Ah me,
    That such a sorrow should be
    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
    To its grave in the bitter wave.
    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
    And the bitter wave was its grave.
    But land and sea waxed hoary
    In whiteness of a glory
    Never told in story
    Nor seen by mortal eye,
    When the third ship crossed the bar
    Where whirls and breakers are,
    And steered into the splendors of the sky;
    That third bark and that least
    Which had never seemed to feast,
    Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star
    I dreamed and did not seek: to-day I seek
        Who can no longer dream;
    But now am all behindhand, waxen weak,
      And dazed amid so many things that gleam
        Yet are not what they seem
    I dreamed and did not work: to-day I work
        Kept wide awake by care
    And loss, and perils dimly guessed to lurk;
      I work and reap not, while my life goes bare
        And void in wintry air
    I hope indeed; but hope itself is fear
        Viewed on the sunny side;
    I hope, and disregard the world that's here,
      The prizes drawn, the sweet things that betide;
        I hope, and I abide
    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I wish I knew what each will do--
      But who can tell as yet
    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I promise you what I will do--
    And I'm content to wait for you,
      And not be sure as yet
    Beatrice, immortalized by "altissimo poeta ... cotanto
    amante;" Laura, celebrated by a great though an inferior bard,--have
    alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor,
    and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at
    least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness
    These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy
    of unnamed ladies "donne innominate" sung by a school of
    less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which
    gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to
    Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her
    lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might
    be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual
    love incompatible with mutual honor
    Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might
    have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn
    even by a devoted friend. Or had the Great Poetess of our
    own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her
    circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in
    lieu of the "Portuguese Sonnets," an inimitable "donna innominata"
    drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy
    to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura
    "Lo di che han detto a' dolci amici addio."--Dante.
    "Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci!"--Petrarca
    Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
      Or come not yet, for it is over then,
      And long it is before you come again,
    So far between my pleasures are and few.
    While, when you come not, what I do I do
      Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest "when:"
      For one man is my world of all the men
    This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
    Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
      Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
      My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
        Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
    Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
        When life was sweet because you called them sweet
    "Era già l'ora che volge il desio."--Dante.
    "Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima."--Petrarca
    I wish I could remember that first day,
      First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
      If bright or dim the season, it might be
    Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
    So unrecorded did it slip away,
      So blind was I to see and to foresee,
      So dull to mark the budding of my tree
    That would not blossom yet for many a May.
    If only I could recollect it, such
      A day of days! I let it come and go
      As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
    It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
    If only now I could recall that touch,
      First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know
    "O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!"--Dante.
    "Immaginata guida la conduce."--Petrarca
    I dream of you to wake: would that I might
      Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
      Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
    As Summer ended Summer birds take flight.
    In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
      I blush again who waking look so wan;
      Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
    In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
    Thus only in a dream we are at one,
      Thus only in a dream we give and take
        The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
      If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
        To die were surely sweeter than to live,
    Though there be nothing new beneath the sun
    "Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda."--Dante.
    "Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
    E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore."--Petrarca
    I loved you first: but afterwards your love
      Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
    As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
      Which owes the other most? my love was long,
      And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
    I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
    And loved me for what might or might not be--
      Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
    For verily love knows not "mine" or "thine;"
      With separate "I" and "thou" free love has done,
        For one is both and both are one in love:
    Rich love knows nought of "thine that is not mine;"
        Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
      Both of us of the love which makes us one
    "Amor che a nulla amato amar perdona."--Dante.
    "Amor m'addusse in si gioiosa spene."--Petrarca
    O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
      More than myself myself, God be with you,
      Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
    To Him whose noble service setteth free,
    Give you all good we see or can foresee,
      Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
      Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
    Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
    So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
      To love you without stint and all I can
    To-day, to-morrow, world without an end;
        To love you much and yet to love you more,
        As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
      Since woman is the helpmeet made for man
                "Or puoi la quantitate
    Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda."--Dante.
    "Non vo' che da tal nodo amor mi scioglia."--Petrarca
    Trust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,
      I love, as you would have me, God the most;
      Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
    Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
    Unready to forego what I forsook;
      This say I, having counted up the cost,
      This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
    The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook,
    Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
      That I can never love you overmuch;
        I love Him more, so let me love you too;
      Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
    I cannot love you if I love not Him,
        I cannot love Him if I love not you
    "Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto."--Dante.
    "Ragionando con meco ed io con lui."--Petrarca
    "Love me, for I love you"--and answer me,
      "Love me, for I love you"--so shall we stand
      As happy equals in the flowering land
    Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
    Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
      Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
    And who hath found love's citadel unmanned?
      And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
    My heart's a coward though my words are brave--
      We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
      So often; there's a problem for your art!
        Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
    Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
        And death be strong, yet love is strong as death
    "Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme."--Dante.
    "Spero trovar pietà non che perdono."--Petrarca
    "I, if I perish, perish"--Esther spake:
      And bride of life or death she made her fair
      In all the lustre of her perfumed hair
    And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
    She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
      Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
      She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
    Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
    She trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,
      She vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,
        And built her people's house that it should stand:--
        If I might take my life so in my hand,
    And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
      And for love's sake by Love be granted it
    "O dignitosa coscienza e netta!"--Dante.
    "Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti."--Petrarca
    Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
      That might have been and now can never be,
      I feel your honored excellence, and see
    Myself unworthy of the happier call:
    For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
      So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
      Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
    Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
    And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
    Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
      But take at morning; wrestle till the break
        Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
        So take I heart of grace as best I can,
      Ready to spend and be spent for your sake
    "Con miglior corso e con migliore stella."--Dante.
    "La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora."--Petrarca
    Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
      Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
      Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
    Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
    Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
      While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
      Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
    Content with all day brings and night will bring.
    Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
      Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
        Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
        A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
      A little while, and life reborn annuls
    Loss and decay and death, and all is love
    "Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti."--Dante.
    "Contando i casi della vita nostra."--Petrarca
    Many in aftertimes will say of you
    "He loved her"--while of me what will they say?
      Not that I loved you more than just in play,
    For fashion's sake as idle women do.
    Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
      Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
      Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
    Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
    But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
      My love that you can make not void nor vain,
    Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
        Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
      I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
        My love of you was life and not a breath
    "Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona."--Dante.
    "Amor vien nel bel viso di costei."--Petrarca
    If there be any one can take my place
      And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
      Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
    I do commend you to that nobler grace,
    That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
      Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
      I too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave,
    And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
    For if I did not love you, it might be
      That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
        But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
      Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
    Your honorable freedom makes me free,
        And you companioned I am not alone
    "E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore."--Dante.
    "Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia."--Petrarca
    If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
      Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
      Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
    Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
      Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
    Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
    To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
      Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned.
    Searching my heart for all that touches you,
      I find there only love and love's goodwill
    Helpless to help and impotent to do,
        Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
        And therefore I commend you back to Him
      Whose love your love's capacity can fill
    "E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace."--Dante.
    "Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome."--Petrarca
    Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
      Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
      Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
    I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
    To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
      Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
    I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
      Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
    Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
      The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
        A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
        The silence of a heart which sang its songs
      While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
    Silence of love that cannot sing again
    Beautiful, tender, wasting away for sorrow;
    Thus to-day; and how shall it be with thee to-morrow?
        Beautiful, tender--what else?
            A hope tells
    Beautiful, tender, keeping the jubilee
    In the land of home together, past death and sea;
        No more change or death, no more
            Salt sea-shore
    Oh why is heaven built so far,
      Oh why is earth set so remote?
    I cannot reach the nearest star
        That hangs afloat
    I would not care to reach the moon,
      One round monotonous of change;
    Yet even she repeats her tune
        Beyond my range
    I never watch the scattered fire
      Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train,
    But all my heart is one desire,
        And all in vain
    For I am bound with fleshly bands,
      Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;
    I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,
        And catch at hope
    Lovely Spring,
    A brief sweet thing,
    Is swift on the wing;
    Gracious Summer,
    A slow sweet comer,
    Hastens past;
    Autumn while sweet
    Is all incomplete
    With a moaning blast,--
    Nothing can last,
    Can be cleaved unto,
    Can be dwelt upon;
    It is hurried through,
    It is come and gone,
    Undone it cannot be done,
    It is ever to do,
    Ever old, ever new,
    Ever waxing old
    And lapsing to Winter cold
    The buttercup is like a golden cup,
      The marigold is like a golden frill,
    The daisy with a golden eye looks up,
      And golden spreads the flag beside the rill,
      And gay and golden nods the daffodil,
    The gorsey common swells a golden sea,
      The cowslip hangs a head of golden tips,
    And golden drips the honey which the bee
      Sucks from sweet hearts of flowers and stores and sips
    Johnny had a golden head
      Like a golden mop in blow,
    Right and left his curls would spread
      In a glory and a glow,
    And they framed his honest face
    Like stray sunbeams out of place
    Long and thick, they half could hide
      How threadbare his patched jacket hung;
    They used to be his Mother's pride;
      She praised them with a tender tongue,
    And stroked them with a loving finger
    That smoothed and stroked and loved to linger
    On a doorstep Johnny sat,
      Up and down the street looked he;
    Johnny did not own a hat,
      Hot or cold tho' days might be;
    Johnny did not own a boot
    To cover up his muddy foot
    Johnny's face was pale and thin,
      Pale with hunger and with crying;
    For his Mother lay within,
      Talked and tossed and seemed a-dying,
    While Johnny racked his brains to think
    How to get her help and drink
    Get her physic, get her tea,
      Get her bread and something nice;
    Not a penny piece had he,
      And scarce a shilling might suffice;
    No wonder that his soul was sad,
    When not one penny piece he had
    As he sat there thinking, moping,
      Because his Mother's wants were many,
    Wishing much but scarcely hoping
      To earn a shilling or a penny,
    A friendly neighbor passed him by
    And questioned him: Why did he cry
    Alas! his trouble soon was told:
      He did not cry for cold or hunger,
    Though he was hungry both and cold;
      He only felt more weak and younger,
    Because he wished so to be old
    And apt at earning pence or gold
    Kindly that neighbor was, but poor,
      Scant coin had he to give or lend;
    And well he guessed there needed more
      Than pence or shillings to befriend
    The helpless woman in her strait,
    So much loved, yet so desolate
    One way he saw, and only one:
      He would--he could not--give the advice,
    And yet he must: the widow's son
      Had curls of gold would fetch their price;
    Long curls which might be clipped, and sold
    For silver, or perhaps for gold
    Our Johnny, when he understood
      Which shop it was that purchased hair,
    Ran off as briskly as he could,
      And in a trice stood cropped and bare,
    Too short of hair to fill a locket,
    But jingling money in his pocket
    Precious money--tea and bread,
      Physic, ease, for Mother dear,
    Better than a golden head:
      Yet our hero dropped one tear
    When he spied himself close shorn,
    Barer much than lamb new born
    His Mother throve upon the money,
      Ate and revived and kissed her son:
    But oh! when she perceived her Johnny,
      And understood what he had done
    All and only for her sake,
    She sobbed as if her heart must break
    There's no replying
    To the Wind's sighing,
    Telling, foretelling,
    Dying, undying,

    Complaining, droning,

    Ever beginning,
    Ending, repeating,

    Lagging and fleeting--
    We've no replying

    To the Wind's sighing
    What are you telling,
    Variable Wind-tone?
    What would be teaching,

    Desolate Wind-moan?
    Ever for ever
    Teaching and preaching,
    Never, ah never
    Making us wiser--
    The earliest riser
    Catches no meaning,
    The last who hearkens
    Garners no gleaning
    Of wisdom's treasure,
    While the world darkens:--
    Living or dying,
    In pain, in pleasure,

    Wind's sighing
    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Sweet of scent;
    Sat and dreamed away an hour,
      Half content, half uncontent
    "Why should rose blossoms be born,
    Tender blossoms, on a thorn
          Though so sweet?
    Never a thorn besets the corn
      Scentless in its strength complete
    "Why are roses all so frail,
    At the mercy of the gale,
          Of a breath?
    Yet so sweet and perfect pale,
      Still so sweet in life and death
    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Where a linnet
    Made one bristling branch the tower
      For her nest and young ones in it
    "Gay and clear the linnet trills;
    Yet the skylark only, thrills
          Heaven and earth
    When he breasts the height, and fills
      Height and depth with song and mirth
    "Nightingales which yield to night
    Solitary strange delight,
          Reign alone:
    But the lark for all his height
      Fills no solitary throne
    "While he sings, a hundred sing;
    Wing their flight below his wing
          Yet in flight;
    Each a lovely joyful thing
      To the measure of its delight
    "Why then should a lark be reckoned
    One alone, without a second
          Near his throne?
    He in skyward flight unslackened,
      In his music, not alone
    Maiden May sat in her bower;
    Her own face was like a flower
          Of the prime,
    Half in sunshine, half in shower,
      In the year's most tender time
    Her own thoughts in silent song
    Musically flowed along,
          Wise, unwise,
    Wistful, wondering, weak or strong:
      As brook shallows sink or rise
    Other thoughts another day,
    Maiden May, will surge and sway
          Round your heart;
    Wake, and plead, and turn at bay,
      Wisdom part, and folly part
    Time not far remote will borrow
    Other joys, another sorrow,
          All for you;
    Not to-day, and yet to-morrow
      Reasoning false and reasoning true
    Wherefore greatest? Wherefore least?
    Hearts that starve and hearts that feast?
          You and I?
    Stammering Oracles have ceased,
      And the whole earth stands at "why
    Underneath all things that be
    Lies an unsolved mystery;
          Over all
    Spreads a veil impenetrably,
      Spreads a dense unlifted pall
    Mystery of mysteries:
    _This_ creation hears and sees
          High and low--
    Vanity of vanities:
      _This_ we test and _this_ we know
    Maiden May, the days of flowering
    Nurse you now in sweet embowering,
          Sunny days;
    Bright with rainbows all the showering,
      Bright with blossoms all the ways
    Close the inlet of your bower,
    Close it close with thorn and flower,
          Maiden May;
    Lengthen out the shortening hour,--
      Morrows are not as to-day
    Stay to-day which wanes too soon,
    Stay the sun and stay the moon,
          Stay your youth;
    Bask you in the actual noon,
      Rest you in the present truth
    Let to-day suffice to-day:
    For itself to-morrow may
          Fetch its loss;
    Aim and stumble, say its say,
      Watch and pray and bear its cross
    Long have I longed, till I am tired
        Of longing and desire;
    Farewell my points in vain desired,
            My dying fire;
    Farewell all things that die and fail and tire
    Springtide and youth and useless pleasure
        And all my useless scheming,
    My hopes of unattainable treasure,
            Dreams not worth dreaming,
    Glow-worms that gleam but yield no warmth in gleaming
    Farewell all shows that fade in showing:
        My wish and joy stand over
    Until to-morrow; Heaven is glowing
            Through cloudy cover,
    Beyond all clouds loves me my Heavenly Lover
    The Spring spreads one green lap of flowers
      Which Autumn buries at the fall,
    No chilling showers of Autumn hours
      Can stay them or recall;
    Winds sing a dirge, while earth lays out of sight
    Her garment of delight
    The cloven East brings forth the sun,
      The cloven West doth bury him
    What time his gorgeous race is run
      And all the world grows dim;
    A funeral moon is lit in heaven's hollow,
    And pale the star-lights follow
    Because you never yet have loved me, dear,
      Think you you never can nor ever will?
      Surely while life remains hope lingers still,
    Hope the last blossom of life's dying year.
    Because the season and mine age grow sere,
      Shall never Spring bring forth her daffodil,
      Shall never sweeter Summer feast her fill
    Of roses with the nightingales they hear?
    If you had loved me, I not loving you,
      If you had urged me with the tender plea
    Of what our unknown years to come might do
    (Eternal years, if Time should count too few),
      I would have owned the point you pressed on me,
    Was possible, or probable, or true
    Oh fair Milly Brandon, a young maid, a fair maid!
      All her curls are yellow and her eyes are blue,
    And her cheeks were rosy red till a secret care made
      Hollow whiteness of their brightness as a care will do
    Still she tends her flowers, but not as in the old days,
      Still she sings her songs, but not the songs of old:
    If now it be high Summer her days seem brief and cold days,
      If now it be high Summer her nights are long and cold
    If you have a secret keep it, pure maid Milly;
      Life is filled with troubles and the world with scorn;
    And pity without love is at best times hard and chilly,
      Chilling sore and stinging sore a heart forlorn
    Walter Brandon, do you guess Milly Brandon's secret?
      Many things you know, but not everything,
    With your locks like raven's plumage, and eyes like an egret,
      And a laugh that is music, and such a voice to sing
    Nelly Knollys, she is fair, but she is not fairer
      Than fairest Milly Brandon was before she turned so pale:
    Oh, but Nelly's dearer if she be not rarer,
      She need not keep a secret or blush behind a veil
    Beyond the first green hills, beyond the nearest valleys,
      Nelly dwells at home beneath her mother's eyes:
    Her home is neat and homely, not a cot and not a palace,
      Just the home where love sets up his happiest memories
    Milly has no mother; and sad beyond another
      Is she whose blessed mother is vanished out of call:
    Truly comfort beyond comfort is stored up in a mother
      Who bears with all, and hopes through all, and loves us all
    Where peacocks nod and flaunt up and down the terrace,
      Furling and unfurling their scores of sightless eyes,
    To and fro among the leaves and buds and flowers and berries
      Maiden Milly strolls and pauses, smiles and sighs
    On the hedged-in terrace of her father's palace
      She may stroll and muse alone, may smile or sigh alone,
    Letting thoughts and eyes go wandering over hills and valleys
      To-day her father's, and one day to be all her own
    If her thoughts go coursing down lowlands and up highlands,
      It is because the startled game are leaping from their lair;
    If her thoughts dart homeward to the reedy river islands,
      It is because the waterfowl rise startled here or there
    At length a footfall on the steps: she turns, composed and steady,
      All the long-descended greatness of her father's house
    Lifting up her head; and there stands Walter keen and ready
      For hunting or for hawking, a flush upon his brows
    "Good-morrow, fair cousin." "Good-morrow, fairest cousin:
      The sun has started on his course, and I must start to-day.
    If you have done me one good turn you've done me many a dozen,
      And I shall often think of you, think of you away
    "Over hill and hollow what quarry will you follow,
      Or what fish will you angle for beside the river's edge?
    There's cloud upon the hill-top and there 's mist deep down the hollow,
      And fog among the rushes and the rustling sedge
    "I shall speed well enough be it hunting or hawking,
      Or casting a bait towards the shyest daintiest fin.
    But I kiss your hands, my cousin; I must not loiter talking,
      For nothing comes of nothing, and I'm fain to seek and win
    "Here's a thorny rose: will you wear it an hour,
      Till the petals drop apart still fresh and pink and sweet?
    Till the petals drop from the drooping perished flower,
      And only the graceless thorns are left of it
    "Nay, I have another rose sprung in another garden,
      Another rose which sweetens all the world for me.
    Be you a tenderer mistress and be you a warier warden
      Of your rose, as sweet as mine, and full as fair to see
    "Nay, a bud once plucked there is no reviving,
      Nor is it worth your wearing now, nor worth indeed my own;
    The dead to the dead, and the living to the living.
      It's time I go within, for it's time now you were gone
    "Good-bye, Milly Brandon, I shall not forget you,
      Though it be good-bye between us for ever from to-day;
    I could almost wish to-day that I had never met you,
      And I'm true to you in this one word that I say
    "Good-bye, Walter. I can guess which thornless rose you covet;
      Long may it bloom and prolong its sunny morn:
    Yet as for my one thorny rose, I do not cease to love it,
      And if it is no more a flower I love it as a thorn
    Never on this side of the grave again,
      On this side of the river,
    On this side of the garner of the grain,
                Never
    Ever while time flows on and on and on,
      That narrow noiseless river,
    Ever while corn bows heavy-headed, wan,
                Ever
    Never despairing, often fainting, ruing,
      But looking back, ah never!
    Faint yet pursuing, faint yet still pursuing
                Ever
    Many have sung of love a root of bane:
      While to my mind a root of balm it is,
      For love at length breeds love; sufficient bliss
    For life and death and rising up again.
    Surely when light of Heaven makes all things plain,
      Love will grow plain with all its mysteries;
      Nor shall we need to fetch from over seas
    Wisdom or wealth or pleasure safe from pain.
    Love in our borders, love within our heart,
      Love all in all, we then shall bide at rest,
      Ended for ever life's unending quest,
        Ended for ever effort, change and fear:
    Love all in all;--no more that better part
        Purchased, but at the cost of all things here
    There is silence that saith, "Ah me!"
      There is silence that nothing saith;
        One the silence of life forlorn,
      One the silence of death;
    One is, and the other shall be
    One we know and have known for long,
      One we know not, but we shall know,
        All we who have ever been born;
      Even so, be it so,--
    There is silence, despite a song
    Sowing day is a silent day,
      Resting night is a silent night;
        But whoso reaps the ripened corn
      Shall shout in his delight,
    While silences vanish away
    I sat beneath a willow tree,
      Where water falls and calls;
    While fancies upon fancies solaced me,
      Some true, and some were false
    Who set their heart upon a hope
      That never comes to pass,
    Droop in the end like fading heliotrope,
      The sun's wan looking-glass
    Who set their will upon a whim
      Clung to through good and ill,
    Are wrecked alike whether they sink or swim,
      Or hit or miss their will
    All things are vain that wax and wane,
      For which we waste our breath;
    Love only doth not wane and is not vain,
      Love only outlives death
    A singing lark rose toward the sky,
      Circling he sang amain;
    He sang, a speck scarce visible sky-high,
      And then he sank again
    A second like a sunlit spark
      Flashed singing up his track;
    But never overtook that foremost lark,
      And songless fluttered back
    A hovering melody of birds
      Haunted the air above;
    They clearly sang contentment without words,
      And youth and joy and love
    O silvery weeping willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Have you no purpose but to shadow me
      Beside this rippled spring
    On this first fleeting day of Spring,
      For Winter is gone by,
    And every bird on every quivering wing
      Floats in a sunny sky
    On this first Summer-like soft day,
      While sunshine steeps the air,
    And every cloud has gat itself away,
      And birds sing everywhere
    Have you no purpose in the world
      But thus to shadow me
    With all your tender drooping twigs unfurled,
      O weeping willow tree
    With all your tremulous leaves outspread
      Betwixt me and the sun,
    While here I loiter on a mossy bed
      With half my work undone
    My work undone, that should be done
      At once with all my might;
    For after the long day and lingering sun
      Comes the unworking night
    This day is lapsing on its way,
      Is lapsing out of sight;
    And after all the chances of the day
      Comes the resourceless night
    The weeping-willow shook its head
      And stretched its shadow long;
    The west grew crimson, the sun smouldered red,
      The birds forbore a song
    Slow wind sighed through the willow leaves,
      The ripple made a moan,
    The world drooped murmuring like a thing that grieves;
      And then I felt alone
    I rose to go, and felt the chill,
      And shivered as I went;
    Yet shivering wondered, and I wonder still,
      What more that willow meant
    That silvery weeping-willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Which spent one long day overshadowing me
      Beside a spring in Spring
      The splendor of the kindling day,
        The splendor of the setting sun,
      These move my soul to wend its way,
          And have done
    With all we grasp and toil amongst and say
      The paling roses of a cloud,
        The fading bow that arches space,
      These woo my fancy toward my shroud;
          Toward the place
    Of faces veiled, and heads discrowned and bowed
      The nation of the awful stars,
        The wandering star whose blaze is brief,
      These make me beat against the bars
          Of my grief;
    My tedious grief, twin to the life it mars
      O fretted heart tossed to and fro,
        So fain to flee, so fain to rest!
      All glories that are high or low,
          East or west,
    Grow dim to thee who art so fain to go
    The soonest mended, nothing said;
      And help may rise from east or west;
    But my two hands are lumps of lead,
      My heart sits leaden in my breast
    O north wind swoop not from the north,
      O south wind linger in the south,
    Oh come not raving raging forth,
      To bring my heart into my mouth
    For I've a husband out at sea,
      Afloat on feeble planks of wood;
    He does not know what fear may be;
      I would have told him if I could
    I would have locked him in my arms,
      I would have hid him in my heart;
    For oh! the waves are fraught with harms,
      And he and I so far apart
    Why has Spring one syllable less
    Than any its fellow season?
    There may be some other reason,
    And I'm merely making a guess;
    But surely it hoards such wealth
    Of happiness, hope and health,
    Sunshine and musical sound,
    It may spare a foot from its name
    Yet all the same
    Superabound
    Soft-named Summer,
    Most welcome comer,
    Brings almost everything
    Over which we dream or sing
    Or sigh;
    But then Summer wends its way,
    To-morrow,--to-day,--
    Good-bye
    Autumn,--the slow name lingers,
    While we likewise flag;
    It silences many singers;
    Its slow days drag,
    Yet hasten at speed
    To leave us in chilly need
    For Winter to strip indeed
    In all-lack Winter,
    Dull of sense and of sound,
    We huddle and shiver
    Beside our splinter
    Of crackling pine,
    Snow in sky and snow on ground.
    Winter and cold
    Can't last for ever!
    To-day, to-morrow, the sun will shine;
    When we are old,
    But some still are young,
    Singing the song
    Which others have sung,
    Ringing the bells
    Which others have rung,--
    Even so!
    We ourselves, who else?
    We ourselves long
    Long ago
    Not for me marring or making,
    Not for me giving or taking;
      I love my Love and he loves not me,
    I love my Love and my heart is breaking
    Sweet is Spring in its lovely showing,
    Sweet the violet veiled in blowing,
      Sweet it is to love and be loved;
    Ah, sweet knowledge beyond my knowing
    Who sighs for love sighs but for pleasure,
    Who wastes for love hoards up a treasure;
      Sweet to be loved and take no count,
    Sweet it is to love without measure
    Sweet my Love whom I loved to try for,
    Sweet my Love whom I love and sigh for,
      Will you once love me and sigh for me,
    You my Love whom I love and die for
    Poor the pleasure
    Doled out by measure,
    Sweet though it be, while brief
    As falling of the leaf;
    Poor is pleasure
    By weight and measure
    Sweet the sorrow
    Which ends to-morrow;
    Sharp though it be and sore,
    It ends for evermore:
    Zest of sorrow,
    What ends to-morrow
    "Oh tell me once and tell me twice
      And tell me thrice to make it plain,
    When we who part this weary day,
      When we who part shall meet again
    "When windflowers blossom on the sea
      And fishes skim along the plain,
    Then we who part this weary day,
      Then you and I shall meet again
    "Yet tell me once before we part,
      Why need we part who part in pain?
    If flowers must blossom on the sea,
      Why, we shall never meet again
    "My cheeks are paler than a rose,
      My tears are salter than the main,
    My heart is like a lump of ice
      If we must never meet again
    "Oh weep or laugh, but let me be,
      And live or die, for all's in vain;
    For life's in vain since we must part,
      And parting must not meet again
    And fishes skim along the plain;
    Pale rose of roses let me be,
      Your breaking heart breaks mine again
    A million buds are born that never blow,
      That sweet with promise lift a pretty head
      To blush and wither on a barren bed
        And leave no fruit to show
    Sweet, unfulfilled. Yet have I understood
      One joy, by their fragility made plain:
      Nothing was ever beautiful in vain,
        Or all in vain was good
    "If you'll busk you as a bride
      And make ready,
    It's I will wed you with a ring,
      O fair lady
    "Shall I busk me as a bride,
      I so bonny,
    For you to wed me with a ring,
      O boy Johnny
    "When you've busked you as a bride
      And made ready,
    Who else is there to marry you,
      O fair lady
    "I will find my lover out,
      I so bonny,
    And you shall bear my wedding-train,
      O boy Johnny
    Such a hubbub in the nests,
      Such a bustle and squeak!
    Nestlings, guiltless of a feather,
      Learning just to speak,
    Ask--"And how about the fashions?"
      From a cavernous beak
    Perched on bushes, perched on hedges,
      Perched on firm hahas,
    Perched on anything that holds them,
      Gay papas and grave mammas
    Teach the knowledge-thirsty nestlings:
      Hear the gay papas
    Robin says: "A scarlet waistcoat
      Will be all the wear,
    Snug, and also cheerful-looking
      For the frostiest air,
    Comfortable for the chest too
      When one comes to plume and pair
    "Neat gray hoods will be in vogue,"
      Quoth a Jackdaw: "Glossy gray,
    Setting close, yet setting easy,
      Nothing fly-away;
    Suited to our misty mornings,
      _A la negligée_
    Flushing salmon, flushing sulphur,
      Haughty Cockatoos
    Answer--"Hoods may do for mornings,
      But for evenings choose
    High head-dresses, curved like crescents,
      Such as well-bred persons use
    "Top-knots, yes; yet more essential
      Still, a train or tail,"
    Screamed the Peacock: "Gemmed and lustrous
      Not too stiff, and not too frail;
    Those are best which rearrange as
      Fans, and spread or trail

      An inimitable neck:
    "After all, there's nothing sweeter
      For the lawn or lake
    Than simple white, if fine and flaky
      And absolutely free from speck
    "Yellow," hinted a Canary,
      "Warmer, not less _distingué_."
    "Peach color," put in a Lory,
      "Cannot look _outré_."
    "All the colors are in fashion,
      And are right," the Parrots say
    "Very well. But do contrast
      Tints harmonious,"
    Piped a Blackbird, justly proud
      Of bill aurigerous;
    "Half the world may learn a lesson
      As to that from us
    Then a Stork took up the word:
      "Aim at height and _chic_:
    Not high heels, they're common; somehow,
      Stilted legs, not thick,
    Nor yet thin:" he just glanced downward
      And snapped to his beak
    Here a rustling and a whirring,
      As of fans outspread,
    Hinted that mammas felt anxious
      Lest the next thing said
    Might prove less than quite judicious,
      Or even underbred
    So a mother Auk resumed
      The broken thread of speech:
    "Let colors sort themselves, my dears,
      Yellow, or red, or peach;
    The main points, as it seems to me,
      We mothers have to teach
    "Are form and texture, elegance,
      An air reserved, sublime;
    The mode of wearing what we wear
      With due regard to month and clime.
    But now, let's all compose ourselves,
      It's almost breakfast-time
    A hubbub, a squeak, a bustle!
      Who cares to chatter or sing
    With delightful breakfast coming?
      Yet they whisper under the wing:
    "So we may wear whatever we like,
      Anything, everything
    In my Autumn garden I was fain
      To mourn among my scattered roses;
      Alas for that last rosebud which uncloses
    To Autumn's languid sun and rain
    When all the world is on the wane!
      Which has not felt the sweet constraint of June,
      Nor heard the nightingale in tune
    Broad-faced asters by my garden walk,
      You are but coarse compared with roses:
      More choice, more dear that rosebud which uncloses
    Faint-scented, pinched, upon its stalk,
    That least and last which cold winds balk;
      A rose it is though least and last of all,
      A rose to me though at the fall
    To think that this meaningless thing was ever a rose
            Scentless, colorless, _this!_
      Will it ever be thus (who knows?)
              Thus with our bliss,
        If we wait till the close
    Though we care not to wait for the end, there comes the end
            Sooner, later, at last,
      Which nothing can mar, nothing mend:
              An end locked fast,
        Bent we cannot re-bend
        All things that pass
        Are woman's looking-glass;
    They show her how her bloom must fade,
    And she herself be laid
    With withered roses in the shade;
      With withered roses and the fallen peach,
      Unlovely, out of reach
        Of summer joy that was
        All things that pass
        Are woman's tiring-glass;
    The faded lavender is sweet,
    Sweet the dead violet
    Culled and laid by and cared for yet;
      The dried-up violets and dried lavender
      Still sweet, may comfort her,
        Nor need she cry Alas
        All things that pass
        Are wisdom's looking-glass;
    Being full of hope and fear, and still
    Brimful of good or ill,
    According to our work and will;
      For there is nothing new beneath the sun;
      Our doings have been done,
        And that which shall be was
    Weary and weak,--accept my weariness;
      Weary and weak and downcast in my soul,
    With hope growing less and less,
      And with the goal
    Distant and dim,--accept my sore distress.
    I thought to reach the goal so long ago,
      At outset of the race I dreamed of rest,
    Not knowing what now I know
      Of breathless haste,
      Of long-drawn straining effort across the waste
    One only thing I knew, Thy love of me;
      One only thing I know, Thy sacred same
    Love of me full and free,
      A craving flame
    Of selfless love of me which burns in Thee.
    How can I think of thee, and yet grow chill;
      Of Thee, and yet grow cold and nigh to death?
    Re-energize my will,
      Rebuild my faith;
      I will arise and run, Thou giving me breath
    I will arise, repenting and in pain;
      I will arise, and smite upon my breast
    And turn to Thee again;
      Thou choosest best,
    Lead me along the road Thou makest plain.
    Lead me a little way, and carry me
      A little way, and listen to my sighs,
    And store my tears with Thee,
      And deign replies
      To feeble prayers;--O Lord, I will arise
    Does that lamp still burn in my Father's house,
      Which he kindled the night I went away?
    I turned once beneath the cedar boughs,
      And marked it gleam with a golden ray;
      Did he think to light me home some day
    Hungry here with the crunching swine,
      Hungry harvest have I to reap;
    In a dream I count my Father's kine,
      I hear the tinkling bells of his sheep,
      I watch his lambs that browse and leap
    There is plenty of bread at home,
      His servants have bread enough and to spare;
    The purple wine-fat froths with foam,
      Oil and spices make sweet the air,
      While I perish hungry and bare
    Rich and blessed those servants, rather
      Than I who see not my Father's face!
    I will arise and go to my Father:--
      "Fallen from sonship, beggared of grace,
      Grant me, Father, a servant's place
    SOEUR LOUISE DE LA MISÉ
    I have desired, and I have been desired;
      But now the days are over of desire,
      Now dust and dying embers mock my fire;
    Where is the hire for which my life was hired?
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire
    Longing and love, pangs of a perished pleasure,
      Longing and love, a disenkindled fire,
      And memory a bottomless gulf of mire,
    And love a fount of tears outrunning measure;
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire
    Now from my heart, love's deathbed, trickles, trickles,
      Drop by drop slowly, drop by drop of fire,
      The dross of life, of love, of spent desire;
    Alas, my rose of life gone all to prickles,--
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire
    Oh vanity of vanities, desire;
      Stunting my hope which might have strained up higher,
      Turning my garden plot to barren mire;
    Oh death-struck love, oh disenkindled fire,
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire
    Life flows down to death; we cannot bind
      That current that it should not flee:
    Life flows down to death, as rivers find
      The inevitable sea
    Men work and think, but women feel;
      And so (for I'm a woman, I)
      And so I should be glad to die
    And cease from impotence of zeal,
    And cease from hope, and cease from dread,
      And cease from yearnings without gain,
      And cease from all this world of pain,
    And be at peace among the dead
    Hearts that die, by death renew their youth,
      Lightened of this life that doubts and dies;
    Silent and contented, while the Truth
      Unveiled makes them wise
    Why should I seek and never find
      That something which I have not had?
      Fair and unutterably sad
    The world hath sought time out of mind;
    The world hath sought and I have sought,--
      Ah, empty world and empty I!
      For we have spent our strength for nought,
    And soon it will be time to die
    Sparks fly upward toward their fount of fire,
      Kindling, flashing, hovering:--
    Kindle, flash, my soul; mount higher and higher,
      Thou whole burnt-offering
    "IF THOU SAYEST, BEHOLD, WE KNEW IT NOT."
              --Proverbs xxiv
    I have done I know not what,--what have I done?
      My brother's blood, my brother's soul, doth cry:
      And I find no defence, find no reply,
    No courage more to run this race I run
    Not knowing what I have done, have left undone;
      Ah me, these awful unknown hours that fly
      Fruitless it may be, fleeting fruitless by
    Rank with death-savor underneath the sun.
    For what avails it that I did not know
      The deed I did? what profits me the plea
    That had I known I had not wronged him so?
        Lord Jesus Christ, my God, him pity Thou;
      Lord, if it may be, pity also me:
        In judgment pity, and in death, and now
    Thou Who hast borne all burdens, bear our load,
      Bear Thou our load whatever load it be;
      Our guilt, our shame, our helpless misery,
    Bear Thou Who only canst, O God my God.
      Seek us and find us, for we cannot Thee
    Or seek or find or hold or cleave unto:
    We cannot do or undo; Lord, undo
      Our self-undoing, for Thine is the key
    Of all we are not though we might have been.
      Dear Lord, if ever mercy moved Thy mind,
        If so be love of us can move Thee yet,
    If still the nail-prints in Thy Hands are seen,
        Remember us,--yea, how shouldst Thou forget?
      Remember us for good, and seek, and find
    Each soul I might have succored, may have slain,
      All souls shall face me at the last Appeal,
      That great last moment poised for woe or weal,
    That final moment for man's bliss or bane.
    Vanity of vanities, yea all is vain
      Which then will not avail or help or heal:
      Disfeatured faces, worn-out knees that kneel,
    Will more avail than strength or beauty then.
    Lord, by Thy Passion,--when Thy Face was marred
      In sight of earth and hell tumultuous,
        And Thy heart failed in Thee like melting wax,
    And Thy Blood dropped more precious than the nard,--
        Lord, for Thy sake, not ours, supply our lacks,
      For Thine own sake, not ours, Christ, pity us
    The irresponsive silence of the land,
      The irresponsive sounding of the sea,
      Speak both one message of one sense to me:--
    Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand
    Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
      Of inner solitude; we bind not thee;
      But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free?
    What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?--
    And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek,
      And sometimes I remember days of old
    When fellowship seemed not so far to seek
      And all the world and I seemed much less cold,
      And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold,
    And hope felt strong and life itself not weak
    Thus am I mine own prison. Everything
      Around me free and sunny and at ease:
      Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees
    Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing
    And where all winds make various murmuring;
      Where bees are found, with honey for the bees;
      Where sounds are music, and where silences
    Are music of an unlike fashioning.
    Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew,
      And smile a moment and a moment sigh
    Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you?
      But soon I put the foolish fancy by:
    I am not what I have nor what I do;
      But what I was I am, I am even
    Therefore myself is that one only thing
      I hold to use or waste, to keep or give;
      My sole possession every day I live,
    And still mine own despite Time's winnowing.
    Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring
      From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative;
      Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve;
    And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing.
    And this myself as king unto my King
      I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me;
    Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing
      A sweet new song of His redeemed set free;
    He bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting?
      And sing: O grave, where is thy victory
        ..."Una selva oscura."--Dante
    Awake or sleeping (for I know not which)
      I was or was not mazed within a wood
      Where every mother-bird brought up her brood
        Safe in some leafy niche
    Of oak or ash, of cypress or of beech
    Of silvery aspen trembling delicately,
      Of plane or warmer-tinted sycamore,
      Of elm that dies in secret from the core,
        Of ivy weak and free,
    Of pines, of all green lofty things that be
    Such birds they seemed as challenged each desire;
      Like spots of azure heaven upon the wing,
      Like downy emeralds that alight and sing,
        Like actual coals on fire,
      Like anything they seemed, and everything
    Such mirth they made, such warblings and such chat
      With tongue of music in a well-tuned beak,
      They seemed to speak more wisdom than we speak,
        To make our music flat
      And all our subtlest reasonings wild or weak
    Their meat was nought but flowers like butterflies,
      With berries coral-colored or like gold;
      Their drink was only dew, which blossoms hold
        Deep where the honey lies;
    Their wings and tails were lit by sparkling eyes
    The shade wherein they revelled was a shade
      That danced and twinkled to the unseen sun;
      Branches and leaves cast shadows one by one,
        And all their shadows swayed
    In breaths of air that rustled and that played
    A sound of waters neither rose nor sank,
      And spread a sense of freshness through the air;
      It seemed not here or there, but everywhere,
        As if the whole earth drank,
    Root fathom deep and strawberry on its bank
    But I who saw such things as I have said,
      Was overdone with utter weariness;
      And walked in care, as one whom fears oppress
        Because above his head
    Death hangs, or damage, or the dearth of bread
    Each sore defeat of my defeated life
      Faced and outfaced me in that bitter hour;
      And turned to yearning palsy all my power,
        And all my peace to strife,
    Self stabbing self with keen lack-pity knife
    Sweetness of beauty moved me to despair,
      Stung me to anger by its mere content,
      Made me all lonely on that way I went,
        Piled care upon my care,
    Brimmed full my cup, and stripped me empty and bare
    For all that was but showed what all was not,
      But gave clear proof of what might never be;
      Making more destitute my poverty,
        And yet more blank my lot,
      And me much sadder by its jubilee
    Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk?
      And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear?
      Alas, I had no shutter to mine ear,
        And could not shun the talk
      Of all rejoicing creatures far or near
    Without my will I hearkened and I heard
      (Asleep or waking, for I know not which),
      Till note by note the music changed its pitch;
        Bird ceased to answer bird,
    And every wind sighed softly if it stirred
    The drip of widening waters seemed to weep,
      All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang,
    Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap
        Sheer down a headlong steep;
      High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang
    Such universal sound of lamentation
      I heard and felt, fain not to feel or hear;
      Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near;
        Nought else but all creation
      Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear
    Shuddering in the misery of its doom:
      My heart then rose a rebel against light,
      Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height,
        Ingathering wrath and gloom,
      Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night
    Ah me, the bitterness of such revolt,
      All impotent, all hateful, and all hate,
    That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt
        Of an imprisoning fate,
      And vainly shakes, and cannot shake the gate
    Agony to agony, deep called to deep,
      Out of the deep I called of my desire;
      My strength was weakness and my heart was fire;
        Mine eyes that would not weep
    Or sleep, scaled height and depth, and could not sleep
    The eyes, I mean, of my rebellious soul,
      For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark:
      A random thing I seemed without a mark,
        Racing without a goal,
      Adrift upon life's sea without an ark
    More leaden than the actual self of lead
      Outer and inner darkness weighed on me.
      The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free
        Surged full above my head
      The moaning tide of helpless misery
    Why should I breathe, whose breath was but a sigh?
      Why should I live, who drew such painful breath?
    Oh weary work, the unanswerable why!--
        Yet I, why should I die,
      Who had no hope in life, no hope in death
    Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf
      Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term;
      But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm--
        Haply, there gnaws a grief--
    Both, haply always; not, as now, so brief
    The pleasure I remember, it is past;
      The pain I feel is passing, passing by;
      Thus all the world is passing, and thus I:
        All things that cannot last
      Have grown familiar, and are born to die
    And being familiar, have so long been borne
      That habit trains us not to break but bend:
    Mourning grows natural to us who mourn
        In foresight of an end,
      But that which ends not who shall brave or mend
    Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough,
      They cling and linger trembling till they drop:
    I, trembling, cling to dying life; for how
        Face the perpetual Now?
      Birthless and deathless, void of start or stop
    Void of repentance, void of hope and fear,
      Of possibility, alternative,
      Of all that ever made us bear to live
        From night to morning here,
      Of promise even which has no gift to give
    The wood, and every creature of the wood,
      Seemed mourning with me in an undertone;
      Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan,
        Trees rustling where they stood
    And shivered, showed compassion for my mood
    Rage to despair; and now despair had turned
      Back to self-pity and mere weariness,
    With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned,
        And might grow more or less,
      And might die out or wax to white excess
    Without, within me, music seemed to be;
      Something not music, yet most musical,
    Silence and sound in heavenly harmony;
        At length a pattering fall
    Of feet, a bell, and bleatings, broke through all
    Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow
      From golden sunset and from ruddy sky;
      The sun had stooped to earth though once so high;
        Had stooped to earth, in slow
    Warm dying loveliness brought near and low
    Each water-drop made answer to the light,
      Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face;
      Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space
        And crept from height to height,
      From height to loftier height crept up apace
    While opposite the sun a gazing moon
      Put on his glory for her coronet,
    Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon,
        As his great splendor set;
      One only star made up her train as yet
    Each twig was tipped with gold, each leaf was edged
      And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west;
    Each mother-bird, and mate-bird, and unfledged
        Nestling, and curious nest,
      Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast
    And filing peacefully between the trees,
      Having the moon behind them, and the sun
    Full in their meek mild faces, walked at ease
        A homeward flock, at peace
      With one another and with every one
    A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell
      Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep
      Hung back a moment, or one lamb would leap
        And frolic in a dell;
    Yet still they kept together, journeying well
    And bleating, one or other, many or few,
      Journeying together toward the sunlit west;
      Mild face by face, and woolly breast by breast,
        Patient, sun-brightened too,
      Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest
      All
    I, All-Creation, sing my song of praise
    To God Who made me and vouchsafes my days,
    And sends me forth by multitudinous ways
      Seraph
    I, like my Brethren, burn eternally
    With love of Him Who is Love, and loveth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Unity
      Cherub
    I, with my Brethren, gaze eternally
    On Him Who is Wisdom, and Who knoweth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Trinity
      All Angels
    We rule, we serve, we work, we store His treasure,
    Whose vessels are we, brimmed with strength and pleasure;
    Our joys fulfil, yea, overfill our measure
      Heavens
    We float before the Presence Infinite,
    We cluster round the Throne in our delight,
    Revolving and rejoicing in God's sight
      Firmament
    I, blue and beautiful, and framed of air,
    At sunrise and at sunset grow most fair;
    His glory by my glories I declare
      Powers
    We Powers are powers because He makes us strong;
    Wherefore we roll all rolling orbs along,
    We move all moving things, and sing our song
      Sun
    I blaze to Him in mine engarlanding
    Of rays, I flame His whole burnt-offering,
    While as a bridegroom I rejoice and sing
      Moon
    I follow, and am fair, and do His Will;
    Through all my changes I am faithful still,
    Full-orbed or strait, His mandate to fulfil
      Stars
    We Star-hosts numerous, innumerous,
    Throng space with energy untumultuous,
    And work His Will Whose eye beholdeth us
      Galaxies and Nebulæ
    No thing is far or near; and therefore we
    Float neither far nor near; but where we be
    Weave dances round the Throne perpetually
      Comets and Meteors
    Our lights dart here and there, whirl to and fro,
    We flash and vanish, we die down and glow;
    All doing His Will Who bids us do it so
      Showers
    We give ourselves; and be we great or small,
    Thus are we made like Him Who giveth all,
    Like Him Whose gracious pleasure bids us fall
      Dews
    We give ourselves in silent secret ways,
    Spending and spent in silence full of grace;
    And thus are made like God, and show His praise
      Winds
    We sift the air and winnow all the earth;
    And God Who poised our weights and weighs our worth
    Accepts the worship of our solemn mirth
      Fire
    My power and strength are His Who fashioned me,
    Ordained me image of His Jealousy,
    Forged me His weapon fierce exceedingly
      Heat
    I glow unto His glory, and do good:
    I glow, and bring to life both bud and brood;
    I glow, and ripen harvest-crops for food
      Winter and Summer
    Our wealth and joys and beauties celebrate
    His wealth of beauty Who sustains our state,
    Before Whose changelessness we alternate
      Spring and Autumn
    I hope,--
              And I remember
                                We give place
    Either to other with contented grace,
    Acceptable and lovely all our days
      Frost
    I make the unstable stable, binding fast
    The world of waters prone to ripple past:
    Thus praise I God, Whose mercies I forecast
      Cold
    I rouse and goad the slothful, apt to nod,
    I stir and urge the laggards with my rod:
    My praise is not of men, yet I praise God
      Snow
    My whiteness shadoweth Him Who is most fair,
    All spotless: yea, my whiteness which I wear
    Exalts His Purity beyond compare
      Vapors
    We darken sun and moon, and blot the day,
    The good Will of our Maker to obey:
    Till to the glory of God we pass away
      Night
    Moon and all stars I don for diadem
    To make me fair: I cast myself and them
    Before His feet, Who knows us gem from gem
      Day
    I shout before Him in my plenitude
    Of light and warmth, of hope and wealth and food;
    Ascribing all good to the Only Good
      Light and Darkness
    I am God's dwelling-place,--
                                  And also I
    Make His pavilion,--
                          Lo, we bide and fly
    Exulting in the Will of God Most High
      Lightning and Thunder
    We indivisible flash forth His Fame,
    We thunder forth the glory of His Name,
    In harmony of resonance and flame
      Clouds
    Sweet is our store, exhaled from sea or river:
    We wear a rainbow, praising God the Giver
    Because His mercy is for ever and ever
      Earth
    I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so
    And so rejoicing, in that I am low;
    Yet known of Him, and following on to know
      Mountains
    Our heights which laud Him, sink abased before
    Him higher than the highest evermore:
    God higher than the highest we adore
      Hills
    We green-tops praise Him, and we fruitful heads,
    Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds:
    We green-tops praise Him, rising from out beds
      Green Things
    We all green things, we blossoms bright or dim,
    Trees, bushes, brushwood, corn and grasses slim,
    We lift our many-favored lauds to Him
      Rose,--Lily,--Violet
    I praise Him on my thorn which I adorn,--
    And I, amid my world of thistle and thorn,--
    And I, within my veil where I am born
      Apple,--Citron,--Pomegranate
    We, Apple-blossom, Citron, Pomegranate,
    We, clothed of God without our toil and fret,
    We offer fatness where His Throne is set
      Vine,--Cedar,--Palm
    I proffer Him my sweetness, who am sweet,--
    I bow my strength in fragrance at His feet,--
    I wave myself before His Judgment Seat
      Medicinal Herbs
    I bring refreshment,--
                          I bring ease and calm,--
    I lavish strength and healing,--
                                    I am balm,--
    We work His pitiful Will and chant our psalm
      A Spring
    Clear my pure fountain, clear and pure my rill,
    My fountain and mine outflow deep and still,
    I set His semblance forth and do His Will
      Sea
    To-day I praise God with a sparkling face,
    My thousand thousand waves all uttering praise:
    To-morrow I commit me to His Grace
      Floods
    We spring and swell meandering to and fro,
    From height to depth, from depth to depth we flow,
    We fertilize the world, and praise Him so
      Whales and Sea Mammals
    We Whales and Monsters gambol in His sight
    Rejoicing every day and every night,
    Safe in the tender keeping of His Might
      Fishes
    Our fashions and our colors and our speeds
    Set forth His praise Who framed us and Who feeds,
    Who knows our number and regards our needs
      Birds
    Winged Angels of this visible world, we fly
    To sing God's praises in the lofty sky;
    We scale the height to praise our Lord most High
      Eagle and Dove
    I the sun-gazing Eagle,--
                              I the Dove,
    With plumes of softness and a note of love,--
    We praise by divers gifts One God above
      Beasts and Cattle
    We forest Beasts,--
                        We Beasts of hill or cave,--
    We border-loving Creatures of the wave,--
    We praise our King with voices deep and grave
      Small Animals
    God forms us weak and small, but pours out all
    We need, and notes us while we stand or fall:
    Wherefore we praise Him, weak and safe and small
      Lamb
    I praise my loving Lord, Who maketh me
    His type by harmless sweet simplicity:
    Yet He the Lamb of lambs incomparably
      Lion
    I praise the Lion of the Royal Race,
    Strongest in fight and swiftest in the chase:
    With all my might I leap and lavish praise
      All Men
    All creatures sing around us, and we sing:
    We bring our own selves as our offering,
    Our very selves we render to our King
      Israel
    Flock of our Shepherd's pasture and His fold,
    Purchased and well-beloved from days of old,
    We tell His praise which still remains untold
      Priests
    We free-will Shepherds tend His sheep, and feed;
    We follow Him while caring for their need;
    We follow praising Him, and them we lead
      Servants of God
    We love God, for He loves us; we are free
    In serving Him, who serve Him willingly:
    As kings we reign, and praise His Majesty
      Holy and Humble Persons
    All humble souls he calls and sanctifies;
    All holy souls He calls to make them wise;
    Accepting all, His free-will sacrifice
      Babes
    He maketh me,--
                    And me,--
                              And me,--
                                      To be
    His blessed little ones around His knee,
    Who praise Him by mere love confidingly
      Women
    God makes our service love, and makes our wage
    Love: so we wend on patient pilgrimage,
    Extolling Him by love from age to age
      Men
    God gives us power to rule: He gives us power
    To rule ourselves, and prune the exuberant flower
    Of youth, and worship Him hour after hour
      Spirits and Souls
    Lo, in the hidden world we chant our chant
    To Him Who fills us that we nothing want,
    To Him Whose bounty leaves our craving scant
      of Babes
    With milky mouths we praise God, from the breast
    Called home betimes to rest the perfect rest,
    By love and joy fufilling His behest
      of Women
    We praise His Will which made us what He would,
    His Will which fashioned us and called us good,
    His Will our plenary beatitude
      of Men
    We praise His Will Who bore with us so long,
    Who out of weakness wrought us swift and strong,
    Champions of right and putters-down of wrong
      All
    Let everything that hath or hath not breath,
    Let days and endless days, let life and death,
    Praise God, praise God, praise God, His creature saith
    Before the mountains were brought forth, before
      Earth and the world were made, then God was God:
    And God will still be God, when flames shall roar
      Round earth and heaven dissolving at His nod:
      And this God is our God, even while His rod
    Of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore:
    And this God is our God for evermore
      Through life, through death, while clod returns to clod.
    For though He slay us we will trust in Him;
      We will flock home to Him by divers ways:
      Yea, though He slay us we will vaunt His praise,
    Serving and loving with the Cherubim,
    Watching and loving with the Seraphim,
      Our very selves His praise through endless days
    Rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins;
      Gird sackcloth not on body but on soul;
      Grovel in dust with faces toward the goal
    Nor won, nor neared: he only laughs who wins.
    Not neared the goal, the race too late begins;
      Or left undone, we have yet to do the whole;
      The sun is hurrying west and toward the pole
    Where darkness waits for earth with all her kins.
    Let us to-day, while it is called to-day,
      Set out, if utmost speed may yet avail--
      The shadows lengthen and the light grows pale:
        For who through darkness and the shadow of death,
    Darkness that may be felt, shall find a way,
        Blind-eyed, deaf-eared, and choked with failing breath
    Thou Who didst make and knowest whereof we are made,
      Oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness,
      Our wordless tearless dumbness of distress:
    Bear Thou in mind the burden Thou hast laid
    Upon us, and our feebleness unstayed
      Except Thou stay us: for the long long race
      Which stretches far and far before our face
    Thou knowest,--remember Thou whereof we are made.
    If making makes us Thine, then Thine we are;
      And if redemption, we are twice Thine own:
    If once Thou didst come down from heaven afar
      To seek us and to find us, how not save?
    Comfort us, save us, leave us not alone,
      Thou Who didst die our death and fill our grave
    So tired am I, so weary of to-day,
      So unrefreshed from foregone weariness,
      So overburdened by foreseen distress,
    So lagging and so stumbling on my way,
    I scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray,
      To hope, or aim, or toil for more or less,--
      Ah, always less and less, even while I press
    Forward and toil and aim as best I may.
    Half-starved of soul and heartsick utterly,
      Yet lift I up my heart and soul and eyes
      (Which fail in looking upward) toward the prize:
    Me, Lord, Thou seest though I see not Thee;
      Me now, as once the Thief in Paradise,
    Even me, O Lord my Lord, remember me
    Lord, Thou Thyself art Love and only Thou;
      Yet I who am not love would fain love Thee;
      But Thou alone being Love canst furnish me
    With that same love my heart is craving now.
    Allow my plea! for if Thou disallow,
      No second fountain can I find but Thee;
      No second hope or help is left to me,
    No second anything, but only Thou.
    O Love accept, according my request;
      O Love exhaust, fulfilling my desire:
      Uphold me with the strength that cannot tire,
    Nerve me to labor till Thou bid me rest,
      Kindle my fire from Thine unkindled fire,
    And charm the willing heart from out my breast
    We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
      Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
      We see the things we do not yearn to see
    Around us: and what see we glancing back?
    Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
      Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be,
      For which we steered on life's salt stormy sea
    Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
    If thus to look behind is all in vain,
      And all in vain to look to left or right,
    Why face we not our future once again,
    Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
      Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
    And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain
    To love and to remember; that is good:
      To love and to forget; that is not well:
      To lapse from love to hatred; that is hell
    And death and torment, rightly understood.
    Soul dazed by love and sorrow, cheer thy mood;
      More blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell:
      Ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell,
    And salt with hope thy life's insipid food.
    Love is the goal, love is the way we wend,
      Love is our parallel unending line
        Whose only perfect Parallel is Christ,
    Beginning not begun, End without end:
        For He Who hath the heart of God sufficed,
      Can satisfy all hearts,--yea, thine and mine
    We feel and see with different hearts and eyes:--
      Ah Christ, if all our hearts could meet in Thee
      How well it were for them and well for me,
    Our hearts Thy dear accepted sacrifice.
    Thou, only Life of hearts and Light of eyes,
      Our life, our light, if once we turn to Thee,
      So be it, O Lord, to them and so to me;
    Be all alike Thine own dear sacrifice.
    Thou Who by death hast ransomed us from death,
      Thyself God's sole well-pleasing Sacrifice,
        Thine only sacred Self I plead with Thee:
        Make Thou it well for them and well for me
    That Thou hast given us souls and wills and breath;
      And hearts to love Thee; and to see Thee, eyes
    Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
      Beyond the drawings each of other's strength:
      One blazes through the brief bright summer's length
    Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
      While one unchangeable upon a throne
      Broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone,
    Content to reign the bright particular star
      Of some who wander or of some who groan.
    They own no drawings each of other's strength,
      Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
        Nor veer along their courses each toward each:
      Yet are their orbits pitched in harmony
    Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
        Mayhap they talk together without speech
    Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground.
      It may be, could we look with seeing eyes,
      This spot we stand on is a Paradise
    Where dead have come to life and lost been found,
    Where Faith has triumphed, Martyrdom been crowned,
      Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise;
      From this same spot the dust of saints may rise,
    And the King's prisoners come to light unbound.
    O earth, earth, earth, hear thou thy Maker's Word:
      "Thy dead thou shalt give up, nor hide thy slain"--
      Some who went weeping forth shall come again
        Rejoicing from the east or from the west,
    As doves fly to their windows, love's own bird
        Contented and desirous to the nest
    [Footnote
    "Quali colombe dal disio chiamate
     Con l'ali aperte e ferme al dolce nido
     Volan per l'aer dal voler portate
                             Dante
    Lifelong our stumbles, lifelong our regret,
      Lifelong our efforts failing and renewed,
      While lifelong is our witness, "God is good:"
    Who bore with us till now, bears with us yet,
    Who still remembers and will not forget,
      Who gives us light and warmth and daily food;
      And gracious promises half understood,
    And glories half unveiled, whereon to set
    Our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire;
      Uplifting us to longing and to love,
    Luring us upward from this world of mire,
      Urging us to press on and mount above
      Ourselves and all we have had experience of,
    Mounting to Him in love's perpetual fire
    A dream there is wherein we are fain to scream,
      While struggling with ourselves we cannot speak:
      And much of all our waking life, as weak
    And misconceived, eludes us like the dream.
    For half life's seemings are not what they seem,
      And vain the laughs we laugh, the shrieks we shriek;
      Yea, all is vain that mars the settled meek
    Contented quiet of our daily theme.
    When I was young I deemed that sweets are sweet:
      But now I deem some searching bitters are
      Sweeter than sweets, and more refreshing far,
        And to be relished more, and more desired,
    And more to be pursued on eager feet,
        On feet untired, and still on feet though tired
    Shame is a shadow cast by sin: yet shame
      Itself may be a glory and a grace,
      Refashioning the sin-disfashioned face;
    A nobler bruit than hollow-sounded fame,
    A new-lit lustre on a tarnished name,
      One virtue pent within an evil place,
      Strength for the fight, and swiftness for the race,
    A stinging salve, a life-requickening flame.
    A salve so searching we may scarcely live,
      A flame so fierce it seems that we must die,
        An actual cautery thrust into the heart:
        Nevertheless, men die not of such smart;
    And shame gives back what nothing else can give,
      Man to himself,--then sets him up on high
    When Adam and when Eve left Paradise
      Did they love on and cling together still,
      Forgiving one another all that ill
    The twain had wrought on such a different wise?
    She propped upon his strength, and he in guise
      Of lover though of lord, girt to fulfil
      Their term of life and die when God should will;
    Lie down and sleep, and having slept arise.
    Boast not against us, O our enemy!
      To-day we fall, but we shall rise again;
    We grope to-day, to-morrow we shall see:
        What is to-day that we should fear to-day?
        A morrow cometh which shall sweep away
      Thee and thy realm of change and death and pain
    Let woman fear to teach and bear to learn,
      Remembering the first woman's first mistake.
      Eve had for pupil the inquiring snake,
    Whose doubts she answered on a great concern;
    But he the tables so contrived to turn,
      It next was his to give and hers to take;
      Till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake,
    And fired a train by which the world must burn.
    Did Adam love his Eve from first to last?
      I think so; as we love who works us ill,
      And wounds us to the quick, yet loves us still.
    Love pardons the unpardonable past:
    Love in a dominant embrace holds fast
      His frailer self, and saves without her will
    Our teachers teach that one and one make two:
      Later, Love rules that one and one make one:
      Abstruse the problems! neither need we shun,
    But skilfully to each should yield its due.
    The narrower total seems to suit the few,
      The wider total suits the common run;
      Each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun;
    Both provable by me, and both by you.
    Befogged and witless, in a wordy maze
      A groping stroll perhaps may do us good;
      If cloyed we are with much we have understood,
    If tired of half our dusty world and ways,
      If sick of fasting, and if sick of food;--
    And how about these long still-lengthening days
    Something this foggy day, a something which
      Is neither of this fog nor of to-day,
      Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
    Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
      And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
      Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
    So out of reach while quite within my reach,
      As out of reach as India or Cathay!
    I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
      I am sick of foresight and of memory,
      I am sick of all I have and all I see,
        I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
    Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!--
        Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you
    So late in Autumn half the world's asleep,
      And half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale;
      For dampness now, not freshness, rides the gale;
    And cold and colorless comes ashore the deep
    With tides that bluster or with tides that creep;
      Now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil
      Of fog, not sultry haze; and blight and bale
    Have done their worst, and leaves rot on the heap.
    So late in Autumn one forgets the Spring,
      Forgets the Summer with its opulence,
    The callow birds that long have found a wing,
      The swallows that more lately gat them hence:
    Will anything like Spring, will anything
      Like Summer, rouse one day the slumbering sense
    Here now is Winter. Winter, after all,
      Is not so drear as was my boding dream
      While Autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam
    On sapless leafage too inert to fall.
    Still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall
      Where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam;
      Still here a bud and there a blossom seem
    Hopeful, and robin still is musical.
    Leaves, flowers and fruit and one delightful song
      Remain; these days are short, but now the nights
      Intense and long, hang out their utmost lights;
    Such starry nights are long, yet not too long;
    Frost nips the weak, while strengthening still the strong
      Against that day when Spring sets all to rights
    A hundred thousand birds salute the day:--
      One solitary bird salutes the night:
    Its mellow grieving wiles our grief away,
      And tunes our weary watches to delight;
    It seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say,
      To know and sing them, and to set them right;
    Until we feel once more that May is May,
      And hope some buds may bloom without a blight.
    This solitary bird outweighs, outvies,
      The hundred thousand merry-making birds
    Whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise
    Would we but follow when they bid us rise,
      Would we but set their notes of praise to words
    And launch our hearts up with them to the skies
    A host of things I take on trust: I take
      The nightingales on trust, for few and far
      Between those actual summer moments are
    When I have heard what melody they make.
    So chanced it once at Como on the Lake:
      But all things, then, waxed musical; each star
      Sang on its course, each breeze sang on its car,
    All harmonies sang to senses wide-awake.
    All things in tune, myself not out of tune,
      Those nightingales were nightingales indeed:
      Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need,
    And wrought a rapture underneath that moon,
      Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed;
    For June that night glowed like a doubled June
    The mountains in their overwhelming might
      Moved me to sadness when I saw them first,
    And afterwards they moved me to delight;
      Struck harmonies from silent chords which burst
      Out into song, a song by memory nursed;
    Forever unrenewed by touch or sight
    Sleeps the keen magic of each day or night,
      In pleasure and in wonder then immersed.
    All Switzerland behind us on the ascent,
      All Italy before us we plunged down
        St. Gothard, garden of forget-me-not:
        Yet why should such a flower choose such a spot?
    Could we forget that way which once we went
      Though not one flower had bloomed to weave its crown
    Beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown,
      Blue and bright-colored for our dim and green;
      Beyond the lands we see, stretch lands unseen
    With many-tinted tangle overgrown;
    And icebound seas there are like seas of stone,
      Serenely stormless as death lies serene;
      And lifeless tracks of sand, which intervene
    Betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown.
    This dead and living world befits our case
      Who live and die: we live in wearied hope,
    We die in hope not dead; we run a race
    To-day, and find no present halting-place;
      All things we see lie far within our scope,
    And still we peer beyond with craving face
    The wise do send their hearts before them to
      Dear blesséd Heaven, despite the veil between;
      The foolish nurse their hearts within the screen
    Of this familiar world, where all we do
    Or have is old, for there is nothing new:
      Yet elder far that world we have not seen;
      God's Presence antedates what else hath been:
    Many the foolish seem, the wise seem few.
    Oh foolishest fond folly of a heart
      Divided, neither here nor there at rest!
        That hankers after Heaven, but clings to earth;
        That neither here nor there knows thorough mirth,
    Half-choosing, wholly missing, the good part:--
      Oh fool among the foolish, in thy quest
    When we consider what this life we lead
      Is not, and is; how full of toil and pain,
      How blank of rest and of substantial gain,
    Beset by hunger earth can never feed,
    And propping half our hearts upon a reed;
      We cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain,
      Lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain
    To fetch back for a solace of our need.
    For who that feel this burden and this strain,
      This wide vacuity of hope and heart,
    Would bring their cherished well-beloved again:
      To bleed with them and wince beneath the smart,
    To have with stinted bliss such lavish bane,
      To hold in lieu of all so poor a part
    This Life is full of numbness and of balk,
      Of haltingness and baffled short-coming,
      Of promise unfulfilled, of everything
    That is puffed vanity and empty talk:
    Its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk,
      Its very song-bird trails a broken wing,
      Its very Spring is not indeed like Spring,
    But sighs like Autumn round an aimless walk.
    This Life we live is dead for all its breath;
      Death's self it is, set off on pilgrimage,
      Travelling with tottering steps the first short stage:
        The second stage is one mere desert dust
        Where Death sits veiled amid creation's rust:--
    Unveil thy face, O Death who art not Death
    I have dreamed of Death:--what will it be to die
      Not in a dream, but in the literal truth
      With all Death's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth,
    The pang that is the last and the last sigh?
    Too dulled, it may be, for a last good-bye,
      Too comfortless for any one to soothe,
      A helpless charmless spectacle of ruth
    Through long last hours, so long while yet they fly.
    So long to those who hopeless in their fear
      Watch the slow breath and look for what they dread:
    While I supine, with ears that cease to hear,
        With eyes that glaze, with heart-pulse running down,
      (Alas! no saint rejoicing on her bed),
        May miss the goal at last, may miss a crown
    In life our absent friend is far away:
      But death may bring our friend exceeding near,
      Show him familiar faces long so dear
    And lead him back in reach of words we say.
    He only cannot utter yea or nay
      In any voice accustomed to our ear;
      He only cannot make his face appear
    And turn the sun back on our shadowed day.
    The dead may be around us, dear and dead;
      The unforgotten dearest dead may be
        Watching us, with unslumbering eyes and heart,
    Brimful of words which cannot yet be said,
        Brimful of knowledge they may not impart,
      Brimful of love for you and love for me
    Wearied of sinning, wearied of repentance,
      Wearied of self, I turn, my God, to Thee;
    To Thee, my Judge, on Whose all-righteous sentence
        Hangs mine eternity:
    I turn to Thee, I plead Thyself with Thee,--
        Be pitiful to me
    Wearied I loathe myself, I loathe my sinning,
      My stains, my festering sores, my misery:
    Thou the Beginning, Thou ere my beginning
        Didst see and didst foresee
    Me miserable, me sinful, ruined me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee
    I plead Thyself with Thee Who art my Maker,
      Regard Thy handiwork that cries to Thee;
    I plead Thyself with Thee Who wast partaker
        Of mine infirmity,
    Love made Thee what Thou art, the love of me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee
    When will the day bring its pleasure?
      When will the night bring its rest?
    Reaper and gleaner and thresher
      Peer toward the east and the west:--
      The Sower He knoweth, and He knoweth best
    Meteors flash forth and expire,
      Northern lights kindle and pale;
    These are the days of desire,
      Of eyes looking upward that fail;
      Vanishing days as a finishing tale
    Bows down the crop in its glory
      Tenfold, fifty-fold, hundred-fold;
    The millet is ripened and hoary,
      The wheat ears are ripened to gold:--
      Why keep us waiting in dimness and cold
    The Lord of the harvest, He knoweth
      Who knoweth the first and the last:
    The Sower Who patiently soweth,
      He scanneth the present and past:
      He saith, "What thou hast, what remaineth, hold fast
    Yet, Lord, o'er Thy toil-wearied weepers
      The storm-clouds hang muttering and frown:
    On threshers and gleaners and reapers,
      O Lord of the harvest, look down;
      Oh for the harvest, the shout, and the crown
    "Not so," saith the Lord of the reapers,
      The Lord of the first and the last:
    "O My toilers, My weary, My weepers,
      What ye have, what remaineth, hold fast.
      Hide in My heart till the vengeance be past
    Lord, I am waiting, weeping, watching for Thee:
      My youth and hope lie by me buried and dead,
      My wandering love hath not where to lay its head
        Except Thou say "Come to Me
    My noon is ended, abolished from life and light,
      My noon is ended, ended and done away,
      My sun went down in the hours that still were day,
        And my lingering day is night
    How long, O Lord, how long in my desperate pain
      Shall I weep and watch, shall I weep and long for Thee?
      Is Thy grace ended, Thy love cut off from me?
        How long shall I long in vain
    O God Who before the beginning hast seen the end,
      Who hast made me flesh and blood, not frost and not fire,
      Who hast filled me full of needs and love and desire
        And a heart that craves a friend
    Who hast said "Come to Me and I will give thee rest,"
      Who hast said "Take on thee My yoke and learn of Me,"
      Who calledst a little child to come to Thee
        And pillowedst John on Thy breast
    Who spak'st to women that followed Thee sorrowing,
      Bidding them weep for themselves and weep for their own;
      Who didst welcome the outlaw adoring Thee all alone,
        And plight Thy word as a King
    By Thy love of these and of all that ever shall be,
      By Thy love of these and of all the born and unborn,
      Turn Thy gracious eyes on me and think no scorn
        Of me, not even of me
    Beside Thy Cross I hang on my cross in shame,
      My wounds, weakness, extremity cry to Thee:
      Bid me also to Paradise, also me
        For the glory of Thy Name
    Shall Christ hang on the Cross, and we not look?
      Heaven, earth, and hell stood gazing at the first,
      While Christ for long-cursed man was counted cursed;
    Christ, God and Man, Whom God the Father strook
    And shamed and sifted and one while forsook:--
      Cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed
      In sweets, our souls in pride, our spirits immersed
    In wilfulness, our steps run all acrook.
    Cry shame upon us! for He bore our shame
      In agony, and we look on at ease
    With neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame:
      What hast thou, what have I, to do with peace?
    Not to send peace but send a sword He came,
      And fire and fasts and tearful night-watches
    Is this the Face that thrills with awe
      Seraphs who veil their face above?
    Is this the Face without a flaw,
      The Face that is the Face of Love?
    Yea, this defaced, a lifeless clod,
      Hath all creation's love sufficed,
    Hath satisfied the love of God,
      This Face the Face of Jesus Christ
    Dear Lord, let me recount to Thee
    Some of the great things thou hast done
        For me, even me
        Thy little one
    It was not I that cared for Thee,--
    But Thou didst set Thy heart upon
        Me, even me
        Thy little one
    And therefore was it sweet to Thee
    To leave Thy Majesty and Throne,
        And grow like me
        A Little One
    A swaddled Baby on the knee
    Of a dear Mother of Thine own,
        Quite weak like me
        Thy little one
    Thou didst assume my misery,
    And reap the harvest I had sown,
        Comforting me
        Thy little one
    Jerusalem and Galilee,--
    Thy love embraced not those alone,
        But also me
        Thy little one
    Thy unblemished Body on the Tree
    Was bared and broken to atone
        For me, for me
        Thy little one
    Thou lovedst me upon the Tree,--
    Still me, hid by the ponderous stone,--
        Me always,--me
        Thy little one
    And love of me arose with Thee
    When death and hell lay overthrown:
        Thou lovedst me
        Thy little one
    And love of me went up with Thee
    To sit upon Thy Father's Throne:
        Thou lovest me
        Thy little one
    Lord, as Thou me, so would I Thee
    Love in pure love's communion,
        For Thou lov'st me
        Thy little one
    Which love of me brings back with Thee
    To Judgment when the Trump is blown,
        Still loving me
        Thy little one
            Spring bursts to-day,
    For Christ is risen and all the earth's at play
            Flash forth, thou Sun,
    The rain is over and gone, its work is done
            Winter is past,
    Sweet Spring is come at last, is come at last
            Bud, Fig and Vine,
    Bud, Olive, fat with fruit and oil and wine
            Break forth this morn
    In roses, thou but yesterday a Thorn
            Uplift thy head,
    O pure white Lily through the Winter dead
            Beside your dams
    Leap and rejoice, you merry-making Lambs
            All Herds and Flocks
    Rejoice, all Beasts of thickets and of rocks
            Sing, Creatures, sing,
    Angels and Men and Birds and everything
            All notes of Doves
    Fill all our world: this is the time of loves
    Man rising to the doom that shall not err,--
      Which hath most dread: the arouse of all or each;
      All kindreds of all nations of all speech,
    Or one by one of _him_ and _him_ and _her_?
    While dust reanimate begins to stir
      Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach;
      While every wave refashions on the beach
    Alive or dead-in-life some seafarer.
    Now meeting doth not join or parting part;
      True meeting and true parting wait till then,
        When whoso meet are joined for evermore,
    Face answering face and heart at rest in heart:--
        God bring us all rejoicing to the shore
      Of happy Heaven, His sheep home to the pen
    Blessèd that flock safe penned in Paradise;
      Blessèd this flock which tramps in weary ways;
      All form one flock, God's flock; all yield Him praise
    By joy or pain, still tending toward the prize.
    Joy speaks in praises there, and sings and flies
      Where no night is, exulting all its days;
      Here, pain finds solace, for, behold, it prays;
    In both love lives the life that never dies.
    Here life is the beginning of our death,
      And death the starting-point whence life ensues;
        Surely our life is death, our death is life:
        Nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife,
    But calm in faith and patience breathe the breath
      God gave, to take again when He shall choose
    They are flocking from the East
    And the West,
    They are flocking from the North
    And the South,
    Every moment setting forth
    From realm of snake or lion,
    Swamp or sand,
    Ice or burning;
    Greatest and least,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth,
    They are flocking up the path
    To their rest,
    Up the path that hath
    No returning
    Up the steeps of Zion
    They are mounting,
    Coming, coming,
    Throngs beyond man's counting;
    With a sound
    Like innumerable bees
    Swarming, humming
    Where flowering trees
    Many-tinted,
    Many-scented,
    All alike abound
    With honey,--
    With a swell
    Like a blast upswaying unrestrainable
    From a shadowed dell
    To the hill-tops sunny,--
    With a thunder
    Like the ocean when in strength
    Breadth and length
    It sets to shore;
    More and more
    Waves on waves redoubled pour
    Leaping flashing to the shore
    (Unlike the under
    Drain of ebb that loseth ground
    For all its roar
    They are thronging
    From the East and West,
    From the North and South,
    Saints are thronging, loving, longing,
    To their land
    Of rest,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth
    "Thou whom I love, for whom I died,
      Lovest thou Me, My bride?"--
    Low on my knees I love Thee, Lord,
      Believed in and adored
    "That I love thee the proof is plain:
      How dost thou love again?"--
    In prayer, in toil, in earthly loss,
      In a long-carried cross
    "Yea, thou dost love: yet one adept
      Brings more for Me to accept."--
    I mould my will to match with Thine,
      My wishes I resign
    "Thou givest much: then give the whole
      For solace of My soul."--
    More would I give, if I could get:
      But, Lord, what lack I yet
    "In Me thou lovest Me: I call
      Thee to love Me in all."--
    Brim full my heart, dear Lord, that so
      My love may overflow
    "Love Me in sinners and in saints,
      In each who needs or faints."--
    Lord, I will love Thee as I can
      In every brother man
    "All sore, all crippled, all who ache,
      Tend all for My dear sake."--
    All for Thy sake, Lord: I will see
      In every sufferer, Thee
    "So I at last, upon My Throne
      Of glory, Judge alone,
    So I at last will say to thee:
      Thou diddest it to Me
    Inner not outer, without gnash of teeth
      Or weeping, save quiet sobs of some who pray
      And feel the Everlasting Arms beneath,--
    Blackness of darkness this, but not for aye;
      Darkness that even in gathering fleeteth fast,
      Blackness of blackest darkness close to day.
    Lord Jesus, through Thy darkened pillar cast,
      Thy gracious eyes all-seeing cast on me
      Until this tyranny be overpast.
    Me, Lord, remember who remember Thee,
      And cleave to Thee, and see Thee without sight,
      And choose Thee still in dire extremity,
    And in this darkness worship Thee my Light,
      And Thee my Life adore in shadow of death,
      Thee loved by day, and still beloved by night.
    It is the Voice of my Beloved that saith:
      "I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, I go
      Whither that soul knows well that followeth
    O Lord, I follow, little as I know;
      At this eleventh hour I rise and take
      My life into my hand, and follow so,
    With tears and heart-misgivings and heart-ache;
      Thy feeblest follower, yet Thy follower
      Indomitable for Thine only sake.
    To-night I gird my will afresh, and stir
      My strength, and brace my heart to do and dare,
      Marvelling: Will to-morrow wake the whirr
    Of the great rending wheel, or from his lair
      Startle the jubilant lion in his rage,
      Or clench the headsman's hand within my hair,
    Or kindle fire to speed my pilgrimage,
      Chariot of fire and horses of sheer fire
      Whirling me home to heaven by one fierce stage?
    Thy Will I will, I Thy desire desire;
      Let not the waters close above my head,
      Uphold me that I sink not in this mire:
    For flesh and blood are frail and sore afraid;
      And young I am, unsatisfied and young,
      With memories, hopes, with cravings all unfed,
    My song half sung, its sweetest notes unsung,
      All plans cut short, all possibilities,
      Because my cord of life is soon unstrung.
    Was I a careless woman set at ease
      That this so bitter cup is brimmed for me
      Had mine own vintage settled on the lees?
    A word, a puff of smoke, would set me free;
      A word, a puff of smoke, over and gone:...
      Howbeit, whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee?
    Yea, only Thee my choice is fixed upon
      In heaven or earth, eternity or time:--
      Lord, hold me fast, Lord, leave me not alone,
    Thy silly heartless dove that sees the lime
      Yet almost flutters to the tempting bough:
      Cover me, hide me, pluck me from this crime.
    A word, a puff of smoke, would save me now:...
      But who, my God, would save me in the day
      Of Thy fierce anger? only Saviour Thou.
    Preoccupy my heart, and turn away
      And cover up mine eyes from frantic fear,
      And stop mine ears lest I be driven astray:
    For one stands ever dinning in mine ear
      How my gray Father withers in the blight
      Of love for me, who cruel am and dear;
    And how my Mother through this lingering night
      Until the day, sits tearless in her woe,
      Loathing for love of me the happy light
    Which brings to pass a concourse and a show
      To glut the hungry faces merciless,
    The thousand faces swaying to and fro,
      Feasting on me unveiled in helplessness
    As once by lonely Paul in his distress.
    As blossoms to the sun I turn to Thee;
      Thy dove turns to her window, think no scorn;
      As one dove to an ark on shoreless sea,
    To Thee I turn mine eyes, my heart forlorn;
      Put forth Thy scarred right Hand, kind Lord, take hold
      Of me Thine all-forsaken dove who mourn:
    For Thou hast loved me since the days of old,
      And I love Thee Whom loving I will love
      Through life's short fever-fits of heat and cold;
    Thy Name will I extol and sing thereof,
      Will flee for refuge to Thy Blessèd Name.
      Lord, look upon me from thy bliss above:
    Look down on me, who shrink from all the shame
      And pangs and desolation of my death,
      Wrenched piecemeal or devoured or set on flame,
    While all the world around me holds its breath
      With eyes glued on me for a gazing-stock,
      Pitiless eyes, while no man pitieth.
    The floods are risen, I stagger in their shock,
      My heart reels and is faint, I fail, I faint:
      My God, set Thou me up upon the rock,
    Thou Who didst long ago Thyself acquaint
      With death, our death; Thou Who didst long ago
  Bear me in mind, whom no one else will know;
      Thou Whom Thy friends forsook, take Thou my part,
      Of all forsaken in mine overthrow;
    Carry me in Thy bosom, in Thy heart,
      Carry me out of darkness into light,
      To-morrow make me see Thee as Thou art.
    Lover and friend Thou hidest from my sight:--
      Alas, alas, mine earthly love, alas,
      For whom I thought to don the garments white
    And white wreath of a bride, this rugged pass
      Hath utterly divorced me from thy care;
      Yea, I am to thee as a shattered glass
    Worthless, with no more beauty lodging there,
      Abhorred, lest I involve thee in my doom:
      For sweet are sunshine and this upper air,
    And life and youth are sweet, and give us room
      For all most sweetest sweetnesses we taste:
      Dear, what hast thou in common with a tomb?
    I bow my head in silence, I make haste
      Alone, I make haste out into the dark,
      My life and youth and hope all run to waste.
    Is this my body cold and stiff and stark,
      Ashes made ashes, earth becoming earth,
      Is this a prize for man to make his mark
    Am I, that very I who laughed in mirth
      A while ago, a little, little while,
      Yet all the while a-dying since my birth?
    Now am I tired, too tired to strive or smile;
      I sit alone, my mouth is in the dust:
      Look Thou upon me, Lord, for I am vile.
    In Thee is all my hope, is all my trust,
      On Thee I centre all my self that dies,
      And self that dies not with its mortal crust,
    But sleeps and wakes, and in the end will rise
      With hymns and hallelujahs on its lips,
      Thee loving with the love that satisfies.
    As once in Thine unutterable eclipse
      The sun and moon grew dark for sympathy,
      And earth cowered quaking underneath the drips
    Of Thy slow Blood priceless exceedingly,
      So now a little spare me, and show forth
      Some pity, O my God, some pity of me.
    If trouble comes not from the south or north,
      But meted to us by Thy tender hand,
      Let me not in Thine eyes be nothing worth:
    Behold me where in agony I stand,
      Behold me no man caring for my soul,
      And take me to Thee in the far-off land,
    Shorten the race and lift me to the goal
    Lord, if I love Thee and Thou lovest me,
      Why need I any more these toilsome days;
      Why should I not run singing up Thy ways
    Straight into heaven, to rest myself with Thee?
    What need remains of death-pang yet to be,
      If all my soul is quickened in Thy praise;
      If all my heart loves Thee, what need the amaze,
    Struggle and dimness of an agony?--
    Bride whom I love, if thou too lovest Me,
      Thou needs must choose My Likeness for thy dower:
        So wilt thou toil in patience, and abide
      Hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour
    When I My Likeness shall behold in thee,
        And thou therein shalt waken satisfied
    "I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,
       I have not thirsted for Thee:
     And now cold billows of death surround me,
     Buffeting billows of death astound me,--
       Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see
       Thy perishing me
    "Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,
       Yea, I have thirsted for thee,
     Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee:
     Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee,--
       Through death's darkness I look and see
       And clasp thee to Me
    A lowly hill which overlooks a flat,
      Half sea, half country side;
      A flat-shored sea of low-voiced creeping tide
    Over a chalky, weedy mat
    A hill of hillocks, flowery and kept green
      Round Crosses raised for hope,
      With many-tinted sunsets where the slope
    Faces the lingering western sheen
    A lowly hope, a height that is but low,
      While Time sets solemnly,
      While the tide rises of Eternity,
    Silent and neither swift nor slow
    Unmindful of the roses,
      Unmindful of the thorn,
    A reaper tired reposes
      Among his gathered corn:
      So might I, till the morn
    Cold as the cold Decembers,
      Past as the days that set,
    While only one remembers
      And all the rest forget,--
      But one remembers yet
    A dancing Bear grotesque and funny
    Earned for his master heaps of money,
    Gruff yet good-natured, fond of honey,
    And cheerful if the day was sunny.
    Past hedge and ditch, past pond and wood
    He tramped, and on some common stood;
    There, cottage children circling gaily,
    He in their midmost footed daily.
    Pandean pipes and drum and muzzle
    Were quite enough his brain to puzzle:
    But like a philosophic bear
    He let alone extraneous care
    And danced contented anywhere
    Still, year on year, and wear and tear,
    Age even the gruffest, bluffest bear.
    A day came when he scarce could prance,
    And when his master looked askance
    On dancing Bear who would not dance
    To looks succeeded blows; hard blows
    Battered his ears and poor old nose.
    From bluff and gruff he waxed curmudgeon;
    He danced indeed, but danced in dudgeon,
    Capered in fury fast and faster.
    Ah, could he once but hug his master
    And perish in one joint disaster!
    But deafness, blindness, weakness growing,
    Not fury's self could keep him going.
    One dark day when the snow was snowing
    His cup was brimmed to overflowing:
    He tottered, toppled on one side,
    Growled once, and shook his head, and died.
    The master kicked and struck in vain,
    The weary drudge had distanced pain
    And never now would wince again.
    The master growled; he might have howled
    Or coaxed,--that slave's last growl was growled.
    So gnawed by rancor and chagrin
    One thing remained: he sold the skin
    What next the man did is not worth
    Your notice or my setting forth,
    But hearken what befell at last.
    His idle working days gone past,
    And not one friend and not one penny
    Stored up (if ever he had any
    Friends; but his coppers had been many),
    All doors stood shut against him but
    The workhouse door, which cannot shut.
    There he droned on,--a grim old sinner,
    Toothless, and grumbling for his dinner,
    Unpitied quite, uncared for much
    (The rate-payers not favoring such),
    Hungry and gaunt, with time to spare;
    Perhaps the hungry, gaunt old Bear
    Danced back, a haunting memory.
    Indeed, I hope so, for you see
    If once the hard old heart relented,
    The hard old man may have repented
    Woman was made for man's delight,--
      Charm, O woman! Be not afraid!
    His shadow by day, his moon by night,
      Woman was made
    Her strength with weakness is overlaid;
      Meek compliances veil her might;
    Him she stays, by whom she is stayed
    World-wide champion of truth and right,
      Hope in gloom, and in danger aid,
    Tender and faithful, ruddy and white,
      Woman was made
    While we slumber and sleep,
    The sun leaps up from the deep,--
    Daylight born at the leap,--
    Rapid, dominant, free,
    Athirst to bathe in the uttermost sea
    While we linger at play--
    If the year would stand at May!--
    Winds are up and away,
    Over land, over sea,
    To their goal, wherever their goal may be
    It is time to arise,
    To race for the promised prize;
    The sun flies, the wind flies,
    We are strong, we are free,
    And home lies beyond the stars and the sea
    A robin said: The Spring will never come,
      And I shall never care to build again.
    A Rosebush said: These frosts are wearisome,
      My sap will never stir for sun or rain.
    The half Moon said: These nights are fogged and slow,
      I neither care to wax nor care to wane.
    The Ocean said: I thirst from long ago,
      Because earth's rivers cannot fill the main.
    When springtime came, red Robin built a nest,
      And trilled a lover's song in sheer delight.
      Gray hoarfrost vanished, and the Rose with might
      Clothed her in leaves and buds of crimson core.
    The dim Moon brightened. Ocean sunned his crest,
      Dimpled his blue,--yet thirsted evermore
    From depth to height, from height to loftier height,
      The climber sets his foot and sets his face,
      Tracks lingering sunbeams to their halting-place,
    And counts the last pulsations of the light.
    Strenuous thro' day and unsurprised by night
      He runs a race with Time, and wins the race,
      Emptied and stripped of all save only Grace,
    Will, Love,--a threefold panoply of might.
    Darkness descends for light he toiled to seek;
      He stumbles on the darkened mountain-head,
        Left breathless in the unbreathable thin air,
      Made freeman of the living and the dead,--
    He wots not he has topped the topmost peak,
        But the returning sun will find him there
    "Arise, depart, for this is not your rest."
      Oh, burden of all burdens,--still to arise
      And still depart, nor rest in any wise!
    Rolling, still rolling thus to east from west,
    Earth journeys on her immemorial quest,
      Whom a moon chases in no different guise.
      Thus stars pursue their courses, and thus flies
    The sun, and thus all creatures manifest
    Unrest, the common heritage, the ban
      Flung broadcast on all humankind,--on all
        Who live; for living, all are bound to die.
    That which is old, we know that it is man.
        These have no rest who sit and dream and sigh,
      Nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall
    Wintry boughs against a wintry sky;
        Yet the sky is partly blue
            And the clouds are partly bright.
    Who can tell but sap is mounting high
            Out of sight,
    Ready to burst through
    Winter is the mother-nurse of Spring,
        Lovely for her daughter's sake.
            Not unlovely for her own;
    For a future buds in everything
            Grown or blown
    Or about to break
    Many a flower hath perfume for its dower,
        And many a bird a song,
    And harmless lambs milkwhite beside their dams
        Frolic along,--
    Perfume and song and whiteness offering praise
        In humble, peaceful ways
    Man's high degree hath will and memory,
        Affection and desire;
    By loftier ways he mounts of prayer and praise,
        Fire unto fire,
    Deep unto deep responsive, height to height,
        Until he walk in white
    A night was near, a day was near;
      Between a day and night
    I heard sweet voices calling clear,
        Calling me:
    I heard a whirr of wing on wing,
      But could not see the sight;
    I long to see my birds that sing,--
        I long to see
    Below the stars, beyond the moon,
      Between the night and day,
    I heard a rising falling tune
        Calling me:
    I long to see the pipes and strings
      Whereon such minstrels play;
    I long to see each face that sings,--
        I long to see
    To-day or may be not to-day,
      To-night or not to-night;
    All voices that command or pray,
        Calling me,
    Shall kindle in my soul such fire,
      And in my eyes such light,
    That I shall see that heart's desire
        I long to see
    Whoso hears a chiming for Christmas at the nighest,
      Hears a sound like Angels chanting in their glee,
    Hears a sound like palm-boughs waving in the highest,
      Hears a sound like ripple of a crystal sea
    Sweeter than a prayer-bell for a saint in dying,
      Sweeter than a death-bell for a saint at rest,
    Music struck in Heaven with earth's faint replying,
      "Life is good, and death is good, for Christ is Best
    A holy, heavenly chime
    Rings fulness in of time,
    And on His Mother's breast
    Our Lord God ever-Blest
    Is laid a Babe at rest
    Stoop, Spirits unused to stoop,
    Swoop, Angels, flying swoop,
    Adoring as you gaze,
    Uplifting hymns of praise,--
    "Grace to the Full of Grace
    The cave is cold and strait
    To hold the angelic state.
    More strait it is, more cold,
    To foster and infold
    Its Maker one hour old
    Thrilled through with awestruck love,
    Meek Angels poised above,
    To see their God look down.
    "What, is there never a Crown
    For Him in swaddled gown
    "How comes He soft and weak
    With such a tender cheek,
    With such a soft, small hand?--
    The very Hand which spann'd
    Heaven when its girth was plann'd
    "How comes He with a voice
    Which is but baby-noise?--
    That Voice which spake with might:
    'Let there be light!' and light
    Sprang out before our sight
    "What need hath He of flesh
    Made flawless now afresh?
    What need of human heart?--
    Heart that must bleed and smart,
    Choosing the better part
    "But see: His gracious smile
    Dismisses us a while
    To serve Him in His kin.
    Haste we, make haste, begin
    To fetch His brethren in
    Like stars they flash and shoot,
    The Shepherds they salute.
    "Glory to God" they sing;
    "Good news of peace we bring,
    For Christ is born a King
    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Soft and weak and small,
    Wrapped in baby's bands
    By His Mother's hands,
      Lord God of all
    Lord God of Mary,
      Whom His Lips caress
    While He rocks to rest
    On her milky breast
      In helplessness
    Lord God of shepherds
      Flocking through the cold,
    Flocking through the dark
    To the only Ark,
      The only Fold
    Lord God of all things,
      Be they near or far,
    Be they high or low;
    Lord of storm and snow,
      Angel and star
    Lord God of all men,--
      My Lord and my God!
    Thou who lovest me,
    Keep me close to Thee
      By staff and rod
    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Loving great and small,
    Love's free Sacrifice,
    Opening Arms and Eyes
      To one and all
    "Love brought Me down; and cannot love make thee
    Carol for joy to Me?
    Hear cheerful robin carol from his tree,
    Who owes not half to Me
    I won for thee
    "Yea, Lord, I hear his carol's wordless voice;
    And well may he rejoice
    Who hath not heard of death's discordant noise.
    So might I too rejoice
    With such a voice
    "True, thou hast compassed death; but hast not thou
    The tree of life's own bough?
    Am I not Life and Resurrection now?
    My Cross balm-bearing bough
    For such as thou
    "Ah me, Thy Cross!--but that seems far away;
    Thy Cradle-song to-day
    I too would raise, and worship Thee and pray:
    Not empty, Lord, to-day
    Send me away
    "If thou wilt not go empty, spend thy store;
    And I will give thee more,
    Yea, make thee ten times richer than before.
    Give more and give yet more
    Out of thy store
    "Because Thou givest me Thyself, I will
    Thy blessed word fulfil,
    Give with both hands, and hoard by giving still;
    Thy pleasure to fulfil,
    And work Thy Will
    Our Master lies asleep and is at rest;
      His Heart has ceased to bleed, His Eye to weep.
    The sun ashamed has dropt down in the west;
      Our Master lies asleep
      Now we are they who weep, and trembling keep
    Vigil, with wrung heart in a sighing breast,
      While slow time creeps, and slow the shadows creep
    Renew Thy youth, as eagle from the nest;
      O Master, who hast sown, arise to reap:
    No cock-crow yet, no flush on eastern crest;
      Our Master lies asleep
    The flowers that bloom in sun and shade
      And glitter in the dew,
        The flowers must fade.
    The birds that build their nest and sing
      When lovely spring is new,
        Must soon take wing
    The sun that rises in his strength
      To wake and warm the world,
        Must set at length.
    The sea that overflows the shore
      With billows frothed and curled,
        Must ebb once more
    All come and go, all wax and wane,
      O Lord, save only Thou
        Who dost remain
    The Same to all eternity.
      All things which fail us now
