-> 1. Use NLTK package to create n-gram models (n=1,2,3,4) based on the corpus (an n-gram list and n-gram frequency list); 
-> 2. Ngram_mle: Calculate the MLE on each n-gram; 
-> 3. Ngram_perplexity: Calculate the perplexities on a piece of sentence;
-> 4. total_Ngram_perpelxity: Based on Ngram_perplexity on each sentence, calculate the total perplexity of the entire poem;

-> 5. Use total_Ngram_perplexity function, calculate the n-gram perplexities on each of the poem generated by two models and make comparison between the two models, create the perplexity table.
